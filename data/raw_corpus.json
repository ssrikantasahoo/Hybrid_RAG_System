    "text": "The Duke of Edinburgh's International Award Canada is the Canadian branch of The Duke of Edinburgh's Award, a personal achievement program available to people in Canada between the ages of 14 and 25. As of 2020, over 500,000 had earned the award. Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh is patron of The Duke of Edinburgh's International Award.\n\nConcept\nThe Duke of Edinburgh's Award was created by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, then the consort of Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada, with the intent of encouraging young people to set and achieve their own goals and challenges. There are three levels—bronze, silver, and gold—but, no competition between participants, as it is a personal achievement program, and there are no set standards to measure achievements; the criteria are based on each participant's improvement and growth. Participants must set goals in multiple program areas: service, skills, physical recreation, an adventurous journey, and an additional project.\n\nHistory\nThe award was launched in Canada in 1963 and opened up to all young Canadians between the ages of 14 and 24. Pilot projects were launched in various cities in Nova Scotia, Ontario, and British Columbia. The following year, one of the first award ceremonies was held, with 48 bronze and six silver awards presented, and the first Gold Award ceremony took place in Ottawa in 1968, when The Duke of Edinburgh presented 18 recipients with their Gold Awards.\nBy 1986, the award was operating in Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia (1970), Quebec, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta,  British Columbia, the Yukon, and the Northwest Territories. In 2018, over 42,000 Canadians participated in the award. Nationally, the program has developed several initiatives to expand the award so it becomes more accessible to at-risk youth, inner-city youth, young offenders, youth with disabilities, as well as northern and aboriginal youth.\nThe award in Canada is associated with the Duke of Edinburgh's International Foundation. In 1967, Canada hosted the first International Gold Event in 1967. Twenty-one years later, Canada became a founding member of the Duke of Edinburgh's Award International Association and is currently one of the four largest national award authorities. In 2002, Canada hosted its second international gold event, Rendezvous 2002.\n\nFollowing the death of Prince Philip in 2021, his youngest son, Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh, was made patron of The Duke of Edinburgh's International Award, announced on 14 March 2023, four days after his oldest brother, Charles III, King of Canada, created him Duke of Edinburgh. He had been a trustee of the international award since 2006.\n\nProvincial\nThe lieutenant governor of Nova Scotia has, each October since at least 2011, issued a royal proclamation declaring Duke Awareness Week, begun with a flag-raising ceremony at Province House. Meant to mark the launch of The Duke of Edinburgh's International Award program in schools across Canada and celebrate students in the province who \"are making a difference in their community\", during the week, young people, award participants, leaders, board members, parents, and volunteers take part in events highlighting participants' work.\n\nSee also\nThe Duke of Edinburgh's Award\nGaisce – The President's Award\nHong Kong Award for Young People\nInternational Award Association\nIsrael youth award\n\nReferences\n\"The Founder, About the Duke of Edinburgh\".

    "title": "The Old Wives' Tale",
    "text": "The Old Wives' Tale is a novel by Arnold Bennett, first published in January 1908.  It deals with the lives of two very different sisters, Constance and Sophia Baines, following their stories from their youth, working in their mother's draper's shop, into old age.  It covers a period of approximately 65 years roughly from 1840 to 1905, and is set in Bursley (modeled on Burslem) and Paris.  It is generally regarded as one of Bennett's finest works. \nBennett was initially inspired to write the book by a chance encounter in a Parisian restaurant. In the introduction to the book, he says\n\n...an old woman came into the restaurant to dine. She was fat, shapeless, ugly, and grotesque. She had a ridiculous voice, and ridiculous gestures. It was easy to see that she lived alone, and that in the long lapse of years she had developed the kind of peculiarity which induces guffaws among the thoughtless.\nand\n\nI reflected, concerning the grotesque diner: \"This woman was once young, slim, perhaps beautiful; certainly free from these ridiculous mannerisms. Very probably she is unconscious of her singularities. Her case is a tragedy. One ought to be able to make a heartrending novel out of the history of a woman such as she.\" Every stout, ageing woman is not grotesque—far from it!—but there is an extreme pathos in the mere fact that every stout ageing woman was once a young girl with the unique charm of youth in her form and movements and in her mind. And the fact that the change from the young girl to the stout ageing woman is made up of an infinite number of infinitesimal changes, each unperceived by her, only intensifies the pathos.\nBennett also found inspiration in Maupassant's novel Une Vie.\n\nSynopsis\nThe book is divided into four parts. The first section, \"Mrs Baines\", details the adolescence of both Sophia and Constance, and their life in their father's shop and house (a combined property) in Bursley, a lightly dramatised version of Burslem. The father is ill and bedridden, and the main adult in their life is Mrs Baines, their mother.\nBy the end of the first book, the more adventurous and frivolous sister, Sophia (whose name reflects her sophistication, as opposed to the constant Constance), escapes Bursley to London and elopes with the travelling salesman, Gerald Scales, against her family’s wishes. Sophia and her husband alight to Paris and she leaves her family behind, ashamed that the money she used to find her freedom was stolen from her wealthy aunt. Constance meanwhile becomes engaged to Mr. Samuel Povey, who works in the shop.\nThe second part, \"Constance\", details the life of Constance from that point forward up until the time she is reunited with her sister in old age. Her life, although outwardly prosaic, is nevertheless filled with personal incident, including the birth of her son, Cyril; the execution of her brother-in-law, Daniel Povey, who had accidentally killed his alcoholic wife; and the subsequent death of her husband, Samuel, whose health fell into rapid disrepair after his brother’s conviction; and her concerns about the character and behaviour of her son, who nevertheless performs well enough at school to win a competitive and coveted scholarship, which takes him away from home.\nThe third part, \"Sophia\", carries forward the story of what happened to Sophia after her elopement. Initially living off her husband, Gerald Scales, £12,000 inheritance, Gerald irresponsibly squanders the sum in a couple of years and runs off, insolvent. Abandoned by her husband in Paris, Sophia shrewdly survives the Siege of Paris and the Paris Commune using a small sum of money she stole from Gerald before his insolvency and eventually becomes the reputable owner of a successful pension.\nThe final part, \"What Life Is\", details how the two sisters are eventually reunited and reflects upon how their lives and fates, despite the vast difference in their demeanor, end up in the same town that had connected them from birth, even as the very character of the town changes underneath them. Sophia returns to England and the house of her childhood, where Constance has never left. The last part follows both sisters until their deaths, with Constance’s death coming after she mustered her last physical strength to vote against the federation of Bursley and the Five Towns into a combined city, with deleterious effects on Bursley’s aged city center. The vote fails, a seeming victory for Constance, who passes away. After her death, a loophole is discovered that invalidates the vote, and Bursley is federated with its neighboring cities, a dramatised version of what is today Stoke-upon-Trent.\n\nDetails and legacy\nAccording to Tom Wolfe (Hooking Up, p. 148), the book was \"wildly successful,\" with the author demurring with \"I don't read my reviews, I measure them.\"\nIn 1998, the Modern Library ranked The Old Wives' Tale No. 87 on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.\nA facsimile edition of the manuscript has been published, which is a testament to Bennett's calligraphic skills.  The original manuscript is in the Lilly Library, Indiana.\nIt was adapted into a 1921 film The Old Wives' Tale starring Fay Compton. It was made into a TV series by the BBC in 1988 as Sophia and Constance.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nThe Old Wives' Tale at Standard Ebooks\n\n The Old Wives' Tale at Project Gutenberg\n The Old Wives' Tale public domain audiobook at LibriVox",

The Italian text is an extensive revision of the libretto by Metastasio first set by Antonio Caldara in 1736, by Mattia Verazi, court poet and private secretary to the Elector Palatine Carl Theodor. The opera was the first of two which J. C. Bach set for the Elector Palatine. Some of the music was reused from earlier works, including part of the overture from Carattaco (composed in London in 1767).\n\nPerformance history\nTemistocle was first performed at the Court Theatre in Mannheim on 4 November 1772, with a notable cast including Anton Raaff and Dorothea and Elisabeth Wendling, all singers that later worked with Mozart.\n\nRoles\nSynopsis\nThe opera takes place in Persia. Temistocle, together with his son Neocle, has been expelled from Athens. He arrives incognito at Susa, the capital of his arch-enemy King Serse, to find that his daughter Aspasia (in love with the Athenian ambassador Lisimaco) has also made her way there, following a shipwreck. Eventually all is revealed and Serse magnanimously pardons everybody, unites the lovers and makes peace with Athens.\n\nRecordings\nA complete recording is available on Oriel Music Trust, OMT945. Conducted by Charles Mackerras, the cast includes William McAlpine, Marie Hayward, Anne Evans, Patricia Kern, April Cantelo, Raimund Herincx, Maureen Lehane, BBC Northern Symphony Orchestra and Singers.

    "title": "Żurrieq",
    "text": "Żurrieq (Maltese: Iż-Żurrieq [ɪzːʊˈrːɪːʔ]) is a town in the Western Region of Malta. It is one of the oldest towns in the country, and has a population of 11,823 inhabitants as of March 2014. Żurrieq is one of the 10 parishes to be documented in 1436 and is dedicated to Saint Catherine. The island of Filfla is administratively a part of the town. The town stretches from Nigret to Ħal Far. In old times the town had a border with Żejtun. The village of Qrendi used to be part of the parish of Żurrieq until 1618 when it was made into its own parish.\nŻurrieq is part of District 5 and votes for the local council every five years. The council is made up of nine members, one of them is the mayor.\n\nMain Landmarks\nOne of the most popular landmarks is the Blue Grotto. Locally it is known as 'Il-Ħnejja' (the arch). It is known for the beautiful shades of blue under the arch. People can go into the arch by boarding a luzzu from Wied Iż-Żurrieq.\nAnother popular landmark is the Xarolla Windmill. It is found in the limits of Żurrieq near Ħal Safi. It is one of the few restored Maltese windmills around the islands. During restorations, catacombs were found underneath the windmill. In front of the windmill is a small chapel dating to the time of the Knights dedicated to Saint Andrew. The chapel has also been restored. In the house of the archpriest one can find a small Punic tower which was built when Malta was under the control of the Phoenicians. There are also remains of a Roman tower near the remains of a chapel in tal-Baqqari. There are a number of churches and chapels in Żurrieq, among them the Parish Church of Saint Catherine and a medieval chapel dedicated to the Annunciation.\nŻurrieq is also known for its big feasts which are held in summer. The first one, which is dedicated to Our Lady of Mount Carmel, is celebrated on the third Sunday of July. The titular feast is held in the honour of Saint Catherine. The feast is held on the first Sunday of September. During both feasts the streets of the town is adorned with decorations. A week of masses and marches are held leading up to Sunday where the statue is carried around the town in a procession. Fireworks are also used throughout the week with a firework show on the eve of the feast. A feast of Saint Catherine is also held on the 25th of November as it is the liturgical feast of Saint Catherine.\n\nChurches and chapels\nParish Church dedicated to Saint Catherine of Alexandria\nThe building of the current church started in 1632–1633 under the direction of Rev. Matteolo Saliba, who was also the architect of the new church. The church was completed in 1658.\nThe church includes a number of paintings by Mattia Preti. These include the Martyrdom of Saint Stephen, Martyrdom of Saint Andrew, Martyrdom of Saint Catherine of Alexandria, Eternal Father, Visitation of the Virgin to Saint Elizabeth, Saint Roch, Saint Blaise, Saint Dominic, Saint Nicholas of Tolentino and of Our Lady of Graces.\n\nBubaqra Church dedicated to the Assumption of Mary (ta' Santa Marija)\nThe present church may have been built on the original site of two old chapels, one dedicated to Saint Roch and the other to Saint Sebastian. The chapel of Saint Mary was built after the plague of 1676. The chapel experienced major restructuring in 1961 when it was enlarged to accommodate the increasing population of the area. This was done on the initiative of Rev. Salv Farrugia.At the present day the church is being taken care of by the Kumitat Pastorali ta' Bubaqra.\n\nNigret Chapel dedicated to the Immaculate conception of Mary\nThe present church was built on the site of a previous chapel dedicated to the Annunciation which was deconsecrated by Bishop Miguel Juan Balaguer Camarasa on 24 November 1658. The church was built by commander James Togores de Valemuola and was finally consecrated by the parish priest of the village Rev. Karm Delicata on 11 October 1739.\n\nChapel of the Annunciation, Ħal-Millieri\nThe now uninhabited village of Ħal-Millieri was first documented in 1419 though it originates from Roman or even pre-historic times. The present church was built around 1450 on the site of an earlier 13th century chapel.\nThe chapel was consecrated in 1480. During Monsignor Pietro Dusina's apostolic visit to Ħal-Millieri, in 1575, he found that there were a total of four churches in the area. Only two of these remain standing; the Annunciation and Saint John the Evangelist. During his visit, Dusina found that the church was in a state of good repair, had three altars and paved. However, he found that the church was not equipped with sacred vestments, income or even a rector.\n\nChapel of Saint John the Evangelist in Ħal-Millieri\nThe original medieval chapel dedicated to Saint John was built sometime around 1481. It is recorded in inquisitor Pietro Dusina's report of his apostolic visit to the chapel in 1575. The report states that the chapel was in a dilapidated state, there were no doors, there were stone benches and a floor of beaten earth. Consequently, the church was deconsecrated. However, some time later it was reconsecrated and equipped with religious objects.\n\nChapel of St. Leo\nThe chapel serves as the official cemetery chapel of Żurrieq. It is the only such chapel dedicated to Pope Leo I in Malta. This chapel was closed in 1658 and reopened twenty years later, after the necessary restoration had been carried out. In this chapel one could also find an old painting on wood that from 1343 to 1575 was in the chapel in Filfla. Today, this painting is found in the parish church of Żurrieq.\n\nChapel of St. Agatha\nThe original church which stood on the site of the present church was built sometime in the 16th century. However it was deconsecrated by the Bishop of Malta, Balaguer on 24 November 1658. The present church was built by Cikku Grixti as a fulfillment of a vow made by a woman. It was blessed by the vicar general Philip Amato on 27 February 1859. The church served as a spiritual base for British soldiers during World War II. In 1952, the church was enlarged and decorated with important items such as the Via Crucis and new vestments. The painting depicting Saint Agatha was restored by R. Bonnici Cali.\n\nChapel of St. James\nThis church is first recorded in the report dating from 1575 during the apostolic visit of inquisitor Pietro Dusina. Beside the original church was another church dedicated to Saint John the Baptist. Both churches were demolished in the early 18th century to make way for a new and bigger church dedicated to Saint James. Work commenced in 1725 and was completed by June 24, 1731.\n\nChapel of St. Bartholomew\nThe original chapel of Saint Bartholomew was built in the year 1482. It was one of the churches which the inquisitor Pietro Dusina visited during his apostolic visit in 1575. He reported that the chapel was in a good state and was equipped with all necessary objects to function, however it lacked a rector and an income.\n\nChapel of St. Andrew\nSaint Andrew's was first mentioned in the reports recounting the visit of inquisitor Pietro Dusina in 1575. However, the chapel was rebuilt in 1634 as mentioned in other pastoral visits. The chapel was deconsecrated in 1658 by Bishop Balaguer. The church remained unused until 1690 when the chapel became the property of the parish church of Saint Catherine.\n\nChapel of St. Luke\nThe origin of the chapel of Saint Luke dates back to the 15th century. It was donated by its benefactor Luqa Zammit in his will dated 1460 as revealed in the notary documents of Luqa Sillato. However, the present structure dates from 1814 when the church was rebuilt on the initiative of Rev. Ġwann Zammit.\n\nPeace Laboratory\nIn 1971 Fr Dionysius Mintoff took over an air force hangar to use as a centre of peace activities, dedicating it to Pope John XXIII. The area was later developed as a peace laboratory.\n\nFeasts\nSaint Catherine of Alexandria\nOur Lady of Mount Carmel\nOur Lady of the Rosary\nOur Lady of tal-Warda\nSaint Joseph\nSaint Rocco\nSaint Stephen\nSaint Andrew\nSaint Clementine\nSacred Heart of Jesus, celebrated in the parish church and also in Nigret.\nCorpus Christi\nThe Assumption of our Lady, Celebrated in Bubaqra\n\nBands and clubs\nSoċjeta Mużikali Santa Katarina V.

    "title": "Aycliffe Stadium",
    "text": "Aycliffe Stadium was a sports facility located in County Durham, England, on the southern edge of the Aycliffe Industrial Estate, which has Newton Aycliffe to the North and Aycliffe Village to the South. The stadium was originally used for greyhound racing and then speedway before stock car racing.\n\nStock Cars\nIt was a short (370 yard) oval tarmac race track, which was used for stock car racing from the mid-1950s until it was closed at the end of 1989. The most regular formula to appear at Aycliffe Stadium was the BriSCA Formula 1 Stock Cars, closely followed by the smaller BriSCA Formula 2 Stock Cars category. National Saloon Stock Car Racing and Banger racing were also regularly held at Aycliffe, along with the occasional Demolition Derby, and the occasional demonstration visit from Autograss formula and Hot Rods (oval racing). The site was used each year for the town's firework display on Guy Fawkes Night.\nFor many Aycliffe is remembered as the Action Track. Aycliffe's tight corners and its suspended steel rope fence, combined with BriSCA's brand of contact racing regularly produced an action-packed spectacle. For most of its history, the stadium was associated with the British Stock Car Association (BriSCA). The first BriSCA licensed race took place on 10 July 1966, and the final BriSCA event was held on 19 November 1989.\nOn Good Friday, 16 April 1954, the first stock car race in Great Britain took place in London at New Cross Stadium. The sport was an instant success and races took place all over the country. Until recently, it is widely believed that the first Stock Car meeting at Aycliffe took place on 7 October 1956. However, photographs from 1955 of a driver's presentation evening at the North Briton Pub (in Aycliffe Village) suggest that stock car racing had already taken place at Aycliffe in 1955. In 1957, Jimmy Wilkinson took over as the promoter at Aycliffe. He retained control of the stadium until 1964, when he handed the role of promoter over to three regular Aycliffe drivers - Tony Neal (100), Ron 'Dixie' Dean (20), and Tom Geldard (154).\nIn 1966, the three brought Aycliffe Stadium into the BriSCA organisation. July 10 was the first licensed meeting. In 1975 Tony Neal emigrated to New Zealand, leaving Tom, Ron and Cissy Dean to run Aycliffe. In the early 1970s, Aycliffe ran a local formula call Supercars, but by 1976 this formula had been replaced by regular F2 racing. At the end of 1985 Ron and Cissy Dean retired from promoting. Jimmy Wilkinson returned to the helm and promoted the stock car racing at Aycliffe until it closed at the end of 1989 to make way for the expanding industrial estate.\n\nBriSCA F1 Final Winners at Aycliffe\n1966 - 11 Meetings - Ron Rogers 5, Ellis Ford 2, Tony Neal, Tom Geldard, Jimmy Young, Arthur Gibson\n1967 - 17 Meetings - Tony Neal 7, Arthur Gibson 3, Ron Rogers 2, Ellis Ford, Ernie Dent, Earl Testo, Doug Cronshaw, Oliver Smith\n1968 - 15 Meetings - Tony Neal 4, Tom Geldard 3, Ellis Ford, Arthur Gibson, Ernie Dent, Mike Holt, Bert Shipman, Chas Finnikin, Brian Wignall\n1969 - 18 Meetings - Stuart Smith 6, Arthur Gibson 3, Jim Esau 2, Tony Neal, Tom Geldard, Jimmy Young, Oliver Smith, Doug Cronshaw, Bert Shipman, Warren Taylor\n1970 - 16 Meetings - Stuart Smith 4, Jim Esau 2, Tony Neal, Arthur Gibson, Ernie Dent, Earl Testo, Doug Cronshaw, Bert Shipman, Pat Byrne, Willie Houseman, Derek Coleman, George Ansell\n1971 - 14 Meetings - Stuart Smith 5, Tony Neal 3, Mike Holt 2, Jim Esau, Jim Donaldson, Willie Harrison, Brian Wignall\n1972 - 15 Meetings - Stuart Smith 5, Doug Cronshaw 3, Tony Neal, Bert Shipman, Willie Harrison, Gordon Smith, Ray Watkins, Rod Falding, Gerald Taylor\n1973 - 14 Meetings - Stuart Smith 8, Doug Cronshaw 3, Dave Fox, Alan Barker, Brian Wignall\n1974 - 12 Meetings - Stuart Smith 4, John Hillam 3, Warren Taylor, Gordon Smith, Mike Close, Brian Wallace, Len Wolfenden\n1975 - 11 Meetings - Stuart Smith 5, Doug Cronshaw 2, John Hillam 2, Willie Harrison, Gordon Smith\n1976 - 13 Meetings - Stuart Smith 6, Mike Close 3, Doug Cronshaw, Willie Harrison, Frankie Wainman, Phil Hayhurst\n1977 - 12 Meetings - Stuart Smith 7, Alan Barker 2, Mike Close, Willie Harrison, Frankie Wainman\n1978 - 13 Meetings - Stuart Smith 7, Mike Close, Willie Harrison, Frankie Wainman, Gerald Taylor, Martin Farrar, Dave Hodgson\n1979 - 12 Meetings - Stuart Smith 3, Len Wolfenden 2, Frankie Wainman 2, Brian Powles, Alan Barker, Mike Close, Andy Stott\n1980 - 12 Meetings - Mike Close 4, Willie Harrison 3, Stuart Smith 3, Frankie Wainman 2\n1981 - 13 Meetings - Len Wolfenden 5, Stuart Smith 3, Mike Close 2, Andy Stott 2, Trevor Todd\n1982 - 13 Meetings - John Toulson 5, Mike Close 4, Andy Stott 3, George Wilkins\n1983 - 13 Meetings - Mike Close 3, John Lund 3, Andy Stott 2, Len Wolfenden 2, John Toulson, Dan Clarke\n1984 - 11 Meetings - Frankie Wainman 3, Mike Close 2, Andy Stott 2, John Lund 2, John Toulson, Harry Smith\n1985 - 11 Meetings - Mike Close 3, Len Wolfenden 3, Richard Ainsworth 2, Harry Smith, John Lund, Ray Tyldesley\n1986 - 11 Meetings - John Lund 6, John Toulson 2, Mike Close, Arthur Gibson, Frankie Wainman\n1987 - 11 Meetings - John Lund 8, Ray Tyldesley, Doug Cronshaw, John Toulson\n1988 - 10 Meetings - John Toulson 5, Peter Falding 2, John Lund 2, Ray Tyldesley\n1989 - 11 Meetings - Peter Falding 4, John Lund 4, John Toulson, David Toulson, Len Wolfenden\n\nBriSCA F1 European Championship Final at Aycliffe\n1987 - Ian Smith (367) 1st,\n\nBriSCA F1 Grand National Championship Final at Aycliffe\n1986 - John Lund (racing driver) (53) 1st,\n1989 - John Lund (racing driver) (53) 1st,\n\nBriSCA F1 World Championship Semi Final Top 3 places at Aycliffe\n1985 - Stuart Smith 1st, Harry Smith 2nd, Dave Berresford 3rd\n1989 - Nigel Whorton 1st, Des Chandler 2nd, Les Mitchell 3rd\n\nBriSCA F2 British Championship Final at Aycliffe\n1989 - Rob Speak (218) 1st,\n\nBriSCA F2 Grand National Championship Final at Aycliffe\n1986 - Malcolm Locke (698) 1st,\n\nBriSCA F2 Benevolent Fund Trophy at Aycliffe\n1987 - Bill Trout (501) 1st,\n\nGreyhound racing\nIndependent (unaffiliated to a governing body) greyhound racing took place at the Aycliffe Stadium.

Instead of a single large sanctuary, the campuses feature separate worship venues (live and video venues), each of which holds less than 1000 people, and all of which can be in worship at the same time with the same sermon but different atmosphere, music and feel. \nThe church is built around a small group lecture/lab model that digs deeper into the topic of the weekend message.  Since 1985, attendance in these small groups has equaled 80-94% of weekend adult attendance.\nThe church also places a high emphasis on community service - averaging nearly 2 service projects per day and periodically, cancelling all worship services to send out worshipers to work on charitable projects throughout the community instead of attending church that weekend.\nThe church moved in a new building in 2010 after spending 20 years in an industrial complex.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website",

Second was Swipe Films' production of Jackboots on Whitehall, an animated film featuring puppets. Menzies, alongside Alan Cumming and Timothy Spall, provided voice work for the comedy spoof, which explored the idea of Nazis invading the United Kingdom at the end of WWII. In his third film of 2010, Menzies starred opposite Genevieve O'Reilly in the drama Forget Me Not, an independent film which premiered at the Culver Plaza Theater in Culver City, CA. .\nThe dramatic comedy Hysteria (2011) featured Menzies, opposite Maggie Gyllenhaal and Hugh Dancy, in the story of the creation of the first Victorian era vibrator. That same year, he would feature in writer Andrew Steggall's short film The Door, an official selection at the 28th annual Warsaw International Film Festival, which was based upon the tale The Door in the Wall by H.G. Wells. In 2012, Menzies starred in director Carrie Cracknell's Nora, a short film inspired by the Young Vic's theatrical production of Henrik Ibsen's play A Doll's House.

The next year, he featured in The Royal Exchange's presentation of The Way of the World, a production of playwright William Cosgreve's 1700s grandiloquent play of manners and Complicite theatre company's Light, an adaptation of author Torgny Lindgren's novel Ljuset (1987). In late 2001, Menzies appeared in Almeida Theatre's production of Anton Checkhov's play Platonov, an adaptation of the early, unnamed play that was Checkhov's first large scale drama. The next year, he portrayed Valentine in the Royal Theatre's production of Tom Stoppard's tragic comedy Arcadia.\nBetween 2003 and 2005, Menzies would co-star in the anti-war drama Serjeant Musgrave's Dance at the Everyman Theatre, and would portray the young teacher Irwin in Alan Bennett's The History Boys, which Nicholas Hytner directed at the Royal National Theatre. Of his role in The History Boys, one reviewer wrote:\n\nThere is a remarkable performance, too, from Tobias Menzies as the slick supply-teacher historian, who believes academic success is merely a matter of tricks and spin. But Menzies also discovers a surprisingly attractive vulnerability in the character I missed the first time around.He would go on to star in Michael Blakemore's West End production of Three Sisters, for which he was nominated for the Ian Charleson Award, and the title role in Rupert Goold's production of Hamlet, at the Royal Theatre, Northampton. Of his role in Hamlet, one reviewer wrote:\nOne of Shakespeare's greatest innovations was to dramatise people's thought processes: the articulation of the mind's search for meaning and identity. This is where Menzies' performance is most thrilling. He shows how language strives to express the self and to pin down the truth. Who am I? What do I think and feel? Menzies' delivery of the \"To be or not to be...\" speech burns with intelligence. This is one of the finest and most exciting Hamlets I've seen. Observe his face: it seems to mature, grow softer, more observant and expressive, and his death becomes a fulfilment as well as a failure \nMenzies took on a supporting role in Playhouse Theatre's 2006 presentation of Pirandello's play As You Desire Me. The next year, he would feature in two productions. First was the role of Peter Trifimov in Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre, followed by a turn as Harry Bagley in Almeida Theatre's production of Caryl Churchill's politically sexual comedy Cloud Nine. Late 2008 saw Menzies portray Edgar opposite Pete Postlethwaite in Liverpool Playhouse's production of King Lear, which continued with a run at London's Young Vic Theatre in early 2009.\nIn 2011, Menzies featured as Dr. Joseph Cardin, opposite Keira Knightley's Karen Wright, in Lillian Hellman's 1934 drama The Children's Hour, which focuses on the harmful effects of wrongful accusations and rumors. He would go on that same year to star in director Rupert Goold's Decade, a play presented through a series of short vignettes penned to mark the tenth anniversary of the September 11th attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City. George Farquhar's 1706 play The Recruiting Officer, which was based upon the methods used by the British Army to recruit troops during the War of the Spanish Succession, saw Menzies star as Captain Plume during the first quarter of 2012. The next year, he would feature in director Carey Cracknell's Rough Cuts: Searched, at the Royal Court Theatre, and star in National Theatre's experimental play The Hush, which explored the connection between sound and memory.\nWallace Shawn's monologue play The Fever, which explored the main character's internal struggle with the morality of a privileged existence, saw Menzies perform to a micro audience at London's decadent May Fair Hotel in early 2015. Director Robert Icke purposely staged the play, produced by Almeida Theatre, at the May Fair Hotel in order to assist the small audience to better internalize its meaning. That same year, he would join an extensive cast for a sixteen-hour production of Homer's The Iliad, performed throughout the day at the British Museum and concluding at the Almeida Theatre, as well as being broadcast live. Working again with director Robert Icke, 2016 would see Menzies star in a modernised interpretation of Chekhov's Uncle Vanya prior to performing dramatic readings of selected sonnets by Shakespeare in Middle Temple Hall's choral programme The Dark Lady and the Tender Churl. Two years later, Menzies would return to the Almeida in their digital theatre production Figures of Speech, which highlighted performances of well known historical speeches. He appeared in series three of the project, which has featured artists such as Ian McKellen, Fiona Shaw, and Andrew Scott.\nEarly 2019 saw Menzies appear in the Gate Theatre's production of Sarah Ruhl's Dear, Elizabeth. The play, which dramatized letters between American poets Elizabeth Bishop and Robert Lowell, featured two different actors each night of the show's run. Later that year, Menzies starred in Almeida Theatre's production of The Hunt, which was set in Denmark and adapted from 2012's thriller film Jagten (The Hunt). The production ran from mid June to early August 2019. His performance garnered positive reviews, with Henry Hitchings of Evening Standard writing, \"Tobias Menzies's performance as Lucas is finely controlled — a quietly devastating portrait of a man whose lonely fight to preserve his dignity takes him to the brink of madness.\"\nMost recently, Menzies was cast as Chris in the National Theatre's adaptation of Alexander Zeldin's The Other Place. The production ran from September to November 2024, and saw Menzies acting alongside actors Emma D'Arcy and Alison Oliver. His performance as Chris, a modernized version of Creon (king of Thebes) in the tale of Antigone, was highly praised by critics. Sarah Crompton for WhatsOnStage.com wrote how he was \"towering as Chris, his constantly twitching hands displaying his anxiousness even when he is at his most urbane, his rocking on his feet conveying a man on the edge, desperately fighting for control and his sanity. (Menzies) is an actor of incredible stillness too; he doesn't react, he simply seems to feel\", whilst Nick Curtis for the Evening Standard wrote that his performance portrayed \"a finely detailed picture of a man who wants to be the 'fun uncle' and the matey stepdad but is implacable when his authority is challenged\".\n\nRadio\nMenzies' first professional radio performance was 2010's drama A Nice Little Holiday, the story of British playwright John Osborne's 1961 besieged holiday in the South of France, which aired on BBC Radio 4 in September of that year. The next year, he would read an abridgement of Matthew Hollis' biography of poet and literary critic Edward Thomas, best known for his poem Adelstrop, on BBC Radio 4's series Book of the Week. In his third collaboration with BBC Radio 4, Menzies was the voice of John Charrington's Wedding (2012), the second episode of a five-part series titled Ghost Stories of E Nesbit. 2013's three-part radio drama, commissioned by BBC Radio 4, saw Menzies portray British writer and National Trust supporter James Lees-Milne, opposite Victoria Hamilton as novelist Nancy Mitford. The series consisted of three interconnected plays, based upon his WWII era journals, cataloging the decline of the English country house and titled Sometimes into the Arms of God, The Unending Battle, and What England Owes. That same year, he would star in BBC Radio 3's drama Serious Money, adapted for radio by Emma Harding from Caryl Churchill's play of the same name, and BBC Radio 4's political drama Every Duchess In England, based upon Parliament's response to England's financial crisis of 1931.\nIn 2014, Menzies featured in a five-part series for BBC Radio 4's Book of the Week where he read Laurie Lee's As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning, an account of his travels in 1930s Spain, in sections released over a five-day period. He would go on the next year to star as Andy Warhol in Sarah Wooley's BBC Radio 4 drama Fifteen Minutes, opposite Adrian Rawlins, and a second five-part Book of the Week series where he, along with the author, would read British travel writer Robert Macfarlane's celebration of language, Landmarks. 2016 would see Menzies in another series which combined literary readings and music in an episode of BBC Radio 3's Words and Music series entitled Trapped. The episode explored both physical and mental entrapment with readings, including authors such as George Orwell and Charlotte Brontë, by both Menzies and Kate Phillips. He would also feature in BBC Radio 4's Comment Is Free, a political and social commentary focusing on a wife, portrayed by Rachael Stirling, who is forced to watch both the public and media eviscerate her husband's story.\nOnce again reading for BBC radio 4's series Book of the Week, Menzies narrated author Philip Hoare's exploration of our fascination with water and the sea in 2017's five-part RISINGTIDEFALLINGSTAR.\n\nActing credits\nTelevision\nFilm\nTheatre\nRadio\nAwards and nominations\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nTobias Menzies at IMDb\n\"Outlander Interview\".

    "text": "Bronów is a village in Gmina Czechowice-Dziedzice, Bielsko County, Silesian Voivodeship, southern Poland. The village lies on the edge of the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia.\nThe name of the village is derived from German personal name Bruno.\n\nHistory\nIt was first mentioned in a written document in 1566 as Braune. Politically the village belonged then to the Duchy of Teschen, a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg monarchy. In 1572, it was sold together with Bielsko and a dozen surrounding villages by dukes of Cieszyn and split from their duchy to form Bielsko state country (since 1754 Duchy of Bielsko).\nAfter Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political and legal district of Bielsko. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910, the population of the municipality grew from 731 in 1880 to 749 in 1910 with a majority being native Polish-speakers (98.1%–100%) accompanied by a small German-speaking minority (at most 14 or 1.9% in 1880), in terms of religion in 1910 majority were Roman Catholics (92.9%), followed by Protestants (6.4%) and Jews (5 people).\nAfter World War I, the fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish–Czechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Poland. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II but after the war, it was restored to Poland.\n\nLandmarks\nIn 1874–1877, the Sacred Heart of Jesus Church was constructed in Bronów. There is also a chapel from 1831 in the village.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n(in Polish) Information at Gmina Czechowice-Dziedzice website Archived 2011-07-27 at the Wayback Machine",

Contributing to the cause of the collapse was the failure of the Hamilton County Engineer's Office to submit the bridge design plans to the Ohio Department of Transportation for review as required by state law.\nThe one-lane bridge was intended to carry U.S. 52 traffic while a replacement for the 93-year-old Miamitown Bridge was being built. It was a compromise between the engineer's office and nearby residents and merchants.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "When Britain emerged victorious from the Second World War, the Labour Party under Clement Attlee came to power and created a comprehensive welfare state, with the establishment of the National Health Service giving free healthcare to all British citizens, and other reforms to benefits. The Bank of England, railways, heavy industry and coal mining were all nationalised. Unlike the others, the most controversial issue was nationalisation of steel, which was profitable. Economic recovery was slow, housing was in short supply and bread was rationed along with many necessities in short supply. It was an \"age of austerity\". American loans and Marshall Plan grants kept the economy afloat. India, Pakistan, Burma and Ceylon gained independence. Britain was a strong anti-Soviet factor in the Cold War and helped found NATO in 1949. Many historians describe this era as the  \"post-war consensus\", emphasising how both the Labour and Conservative Parties until the 1970s tolerated or encouraged nationalisation, strong trade unions, heavy regulation, high taxes, and generous welfare state.\nThe Labour Party introduced charges for NHS dental services and glasses in 1951. The Conservatives returned to power in 1951, accepting most of Labour's post-war reforms but introducing prescription charges to the NHS in 1952 and denationalising steel in 1953. They presided over 13 years of economic recovery and stability. However, the Suez Crisis of 1956 demonstrated that Britain was no longer a superpower. Ghana, Malaya, Nigeria and Kenya were granted independence during this period. Labour returned to power under Harold Wilson in 1964 and oversaw a series of social reforms including the partial decriminalisation of homosexuality and abortion, the relaxing of divorce laws and the end of capital punishment. Edward Heath returned the Conservatives to power from 1970 to 1974 and oversaw the decimalisation of British currency, the accession of Britain to the European Communities and the height of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. In the wake of the 1973 oil crisis and a miner's strike, Heath introduced the three-day working week to conserve power.\nLabour made a return to power in 1974, but a series of strikes carried out by trade unions over the winter of 1978/79 (known as the Winter of Discontent) paralysed the country and Labour lost its majority in parliament. The general election in 1979 took Conservative Margaret Thatcher to power, effectively ending the postwar state interventionist consensus of prior decades despite initial intense Labour opposition.\n\nLabour Government, 1945–1951\nFollowing the Second World War, the landslide 1945 election returned the Labour Party to power and Clement Attlee became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. The party quickly nationalised critical sectors of the economy, especially declining industries. The Bank of England was nationalised along with railways (see Transport Act 1947), coal mining, public utilities and heavy industry. The most controversial case was the takeover of the highly profitable iron and steel industry, which was opposed and finally reversed by the Conservatives.\n\nWelfare state\nA comprehensive welfare state was created with the National Insurance Act 1946, in which people in work paid a flat rate of National Insurance. In return, they (and the wives of male contributors) were eligible for flat-rate pensions, sickness benefit, unemployment benefit, and funeral benefits. Various other pieces of legislation provided for child benefit and support for people with no other source of income.\n\nIn the estimation of historians, and later politicians of the major parties, the most successful and permanent program was the creation of a National Health Service which started operations in 1947. It entitled all citizens to healthcare, which, funded by taxation, was free at the point of delivery. The opposition from physicians was bought off by allowing them to keep lucrative private practices on the side.  All hospitals were nationalised and brought into the system. John Carrier and Ian Kendall find that the mission of the Minister of Health Aneurin Bevan was resolving \"The potential conflict between the aim of providing a universalist, comprehensive health service of a good standard and that of containing health costs to a reasonable level, and how to finance the system in such a way that certainty and sufficiency of funds could be guaranteed.\" Michael Foot adds that Bevan had to persuade \"the most conservative and respected profession in the country to accept and operate the Labour government's most intrinsically socialist proposition.\"  In the end historians give Bevan the major credit for the success.\nOne of the main achievements of Attlee's government was the maintenance of near full employment. The government maintained most of the wartime controls over the economy, including control over the allocation of materials and manpower, and unemployment rarely rose above 500,000, or 3% of the total workforce. In fact labour shortages proved to be more of a problem. One area where the government was not quite as successful was in housing, which was also the responsibility of Aneurin Bevan. The government aimed to build 400,000 new houses a year to replace those destroyed in the war, but shortages of materials and manpower meant that less than half this number were built.\n\nForeign affairs\nDespite the heavy American grants of Lend-Lease food oil and munitions (which did not have to be repaid) plus American loans, and a grant of money and loans from Canada at the end of the war Britain was on the verge of bankruptcy. John Maynard Keynes argued the only solution was to drastically cut back the spending on the British Empire, which amounted to £2,000 million. The post-war overseas deficit was £1,400 million, warned Keynes. and, \"it is this expenditure which is wholly responsible for either financial difficulties.\" Both Churchill and Attlee ignored his advice and kept spending heavily, in part by borrowing from India. The United States provided a large 50-year loan in 1946, and the sudden grant of independence to India and Pakistan in 1947 sharply cut expenses. Marshall Plan money began flowing in 1948, and by the time it ended in 1951 the financial crisis was over.  The new Labour government knew the expenses of British involvement across the globe were financially crippling.  The post-war military cost £200 million a year, to put 1.3 million men (and a few thousand women) in uniform, keep operational combat fleets stationed in the Atlantic, the Mediterranean, and the Indian Ocean as well as Hong Kong, fund bases across the globe, as well as 120 full Royal Air Force squadrons.  Britain now shed traditional overseas military roles as fast as possible.   American financial aid was available on Washington's terms, as seen in the 1945 loan, the convertibility of sterling crisis of 1947, the devaluation of sterling in 1949, and the rearmament program in support of the U.S. in the Korean War, 1950–53. On the other hand, he had some success in convincing  Washington to take over roles that were too expensive for Britain, including the rebuilding of the European economy and supporting anti-communist governments in Greece and elsewhere.  Bevin had the firm support of his party, especially Prime Minister  Attlee,  despite a left-wing opposition. Top American diplomats such as Dean Acheson trusted Bevin and worked through him.\n\nIndia\nFor decades the Conservatives were split on India between die-hard imperialists (led by Churchill) and moderate elements who tried to provide limited local control.  Meanwhile, the small Labour minority in Parliament was sympathetic to the Congress movement led by Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru. Decolonisation was never a major election issue; Labour was not officially in favour of decolonisation when it was elected in 1945. With violence escalating in India after the war, but with British financial power at a low ebb, large-scale military involvement was impossible. The Viceroy of India warned he needed a further seven army divisions to prevent communal violence if independence negotiations failed. None were available, so political restructuring was accelerated. The Labour government gave independence to India and Pakistan in an unexpectedly quick move in 1947.  One recent historian and Conservative party sympathiser Andrew Roberts says the independence of India was a \"national humiliation\" but it was necessitated by urgent financial, administrative, strategic and political needs.  Whereas Churchill in 1940–45 had tightened the hold on India and imprisoned the Congress leadership, Labour had looked forward to making it a fully independent dominion like Canada or Australia. Many of the Congress leaders in India had studied in England, and were highly regarded as fellow idealistic socialists by Labour leaders. Attlee was the Labour expert on India and took special charge of decolonization.  Attlee found that Churchill's viceroy, Field Marshal Archibald Wavell, was too imperialistic, too keen on military solutions (he wanted seven more Army divisions) and too neglectful of Indian political alignments. The new Viceroy was Lord Mountbatten, the dashing war hero and a cousin of King George VI. The boundary between the newly created states of Pakistan and India involved the widespread resettlement of millions of Muslims and Hindus (and many Sikhs). Extreme violence ensued when Punjab and Bengal provinces were split. Historian Yasmin Khan estimates that between a half-million and a million men, women and children were killed. Gandhi himself was assassinated by a Hindu Mahasabha activist in January 1948.  Popular and elite opinion in Britain at the time did not view Indian independence as a humiliation but as a successful completion of a process long underway, and strongly supported by Labour and indeed most of the Conservative party as well. A major reason that Churchill was in the wilderness during the 1930s was his refusal to support the Conservative position in favor of independence for India. Independence strengthened the Commonwealth of Nations, and had a valuable impact on the British economy, with large sums transferring back and forth, as well as fresh migrants arriving from India. In sharp contrast, France felt humiliated by its loss of its colonial empire, especially Algeria and Vietnam. The success  in India encouraged and embolden the development programs of ambitious young British colonial officials in Africa and the rest of Asia.\nIn sharp contrast, the British people were disappointed with their humiliation in Mandatory Palestine. They had managed to alienate both sides. Arabs and Jews had been fighting for years, in nasty conflicts that were still fierce seven decades later. The British decided to get out in 1948 so as not to further alienate their very large clientele in the oil-rich Arab nations.\n\nInternational relations\nBritain became a founding member of the United Nations during this time and of NATO in 1949. Under foreign minister Ernest Bevin, Britain took a strong anti-Soviet position in the emerging Cold War. Cooperation with the United States was good, except in the area of nuclear weapons, where president Harry Truman ended cooperation. Britain had to develop its own nuclear arsenal, with the first test in 1952.  Mandatory military service continued, as despite the end of World War II, Britain continued to wage numerous small colonial conflicts around the globe: the Malayan Emergency, 1948–1960, in Kenya against the Mau Mau Uprising (1952–60) and against Egypt in the 1956 Suez Crisis.\n\nFinances\nInternational finance was a troublesome issue, as Britain had used up all its reserves and had to borrow large sums from the United States and from the International Monetary Fund.  The U.S. provided a loan of $3.75 billion (US$57 billion in 2017) at a low 2% interest rate; Canada loaned an additional US$1.19 billion (US$16 billion in 2017). Starting in 1948, the United States provided grants of $3.3 billion (about US$33 billion in 2017). These funds came through the Marshall Plan and did not have to be repaid, however they carried the proviso that Britain modernise the management of its major corporations. The aid permitted Britain to provide consumption at tolerable levels despite the austerity.  About 40 per cent of the dollars went for food, drink and tobacco from the U.S. and 40 per cent on raw materials. The remainder went mostly for machinery and oil.\nBy 1950, the Korean War caused a new heavy drain on the Treasury for military expenses. This caused the bitter split inside the Labour party.  The Conservatives made austerity a major issue in the general election of 1950. Labour lost most of its large majority. The swing was 3.6% against it and it lost 78 seats, leaving Attlee with a slim majority in the House. However, a year later Labour lost the general election of 1951 despite polling more votes than in the 1945 election, and indeed more votes than the Conservative Party.\n\nConservative Government, 1951–1964\nWinston Churchill (1951–1955)\nWinston Churchill again became prime minister.  His third government – after the wartime national government and the short caretaker government of 1945 – would last until his resignation in 1955. During this period he renewed what he called the \"special relationship\" between Britain and the United States, and engaged himself in the formation of the post-war order.\nHis domestic priorities followed the post-war consensus with minor adjustments. However, foreign policy crises took centre stage. They were partly the result of the continued decline of British military and imperial prestige and power.\nIn February 1952, King George VI died and was succeeded by his eldest daughter Elizabeth II. Her coronation on 2 June 1953 gave the British people a renewed sense of national pride and enthusiasm which had been lowered by the war.\n\nAnglo-Iranian Oil Dispute\nIn March 1951, the Iranian parliament (the Majlis) voted to nationalise the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (AIOC) and its holdings by passing a bill strongly backed by Mohammad Mosaddegh, who was elected prime minister the following April by a large majority of the parliament.  The International Court of Justice was called in to settle the dispute, but a 50/50 profit-sharing arrangement, with recognition of nationalisation, was rejected by Mossadegh. Direct negotiations between the British and the Iranian government ceased, and over the course of 1951, the British ratcheted up the pressure on the Iranian government and explored the possibility of a coup against it. U.S. President Truman was reluctant to agree, placing a much higher priority on the Korean War. Churchill's return to power and Dwight D. Eisenhower's presidency brought with them a policy of undermining the Mossadegh government. Both sides floated proposals unacceptable to the other, each side believing that time was on its side.  Negotiations broke down, and as the blockade's political and economic costs mounted inside Iran, coup plots arose from the army and pro-British factions in the Majlis.\n\nThe Mau Mau Rebellion\nIn 1951, grievances against the colonial distribution of land came to a head with the Kenya Africa Union demanding greater representation and land reform.  When these demands were rejected, more radical elements came forward, launching the Mau Mau rebellion in 1952. On 17 August 1952, a state of emergency was declared, and British troops were flown to Kenya to deal with the rebellion. As both sides increased the ferocity of their attacks, the country moved to full-scale civil war.\n\nMalayan Emergency\nIn Malaya, a rebellion against British rule had been in progress since 1948, led by Communists based in the local Chinese community.  Once again, Churchill's government inherited a crisis, and once again Churchill chose to use direct military action against those in rebellion while attempting to build an alliance with those who were not. He stepped up the implementation of a \"hearts and minds\" campaign and approved the creation of fortified villages, a tactic that would become a recurring part of Western military strategy in South-East Asia, especially in the American role in the  Vietnam War.\n\nAnthony Eden (1955–1957)\nSuez Crisis\nIn April 1955, Churchill finally retired, and Anthony Eden succeeded him as prime minister. Eden was a very popular figure, as a result of his long wartime service and also his famous good looks and charm. On taking office he immediately called a general election, at which the Conservatives were returned with an increased majority. He left domestic issues to his lieutenants such as Rab Butler, and concentrated largely on foreign policy, forming a close alliance with US President Dwight D. Eisenhower.\nOn 26 July 1956 Gamal Abdel Nasser, President of Egypt, nationalised the Suez Canal company, in violation of the international agreement he had signed with the UK in 1954. It had been owned and controlled by Britain since 1875 and was seen as essential to national defence and access to the Far East. Eden drawing on his experience in the 1930s, saw Nasser as another Mussolini who had to be stopped. In November 1956, after months of negotiation and attempts at mediation had failed to dissuade Nasser, Britain and France, in conjunction with Israel, invaded Egypt and occupied the Suez Canal Zone.\nDwight D. Eisenhower had warned Eden not to do it, saying the American people would never approve of a military solution to the crisis. He threatened to use financial pressure unless the British withdrew from Egypt. Eden had ignored Britain's financial dependence on the US in the wake of World War II, and was forced to bow to American pressure to withdraw. Eden had poor staff support because the Foreign Office, Commonwealth Relations Office, and Colonial Office had been slow to realise the need for change in Britain's world role. After Suez they started to heed Treasury warnings about the effect of high defence expenditure on the economy, and the slow growth of the British population compared with the United States and the Soviet Union. Historians often use the crisis to mark the end of Britain's status as a superpower, being able to act and control international affairs without assistance or coalition.\n\nHarold Macmillan (1957–1963)\nEden resigned in the wake of the Suez Crisis, and his Chancellor of the Exchequer, Harold Macmillan succeeded him as prime minister on 10 January. He brought the economic concerns of the exchequer into the premiership, but his approach to the economy was to seek high employment; whereas his treasury ministers argued that to support the Bretton Woods system's requirement on the pound sterling would require strict control of the money base, and hence a rise in unemployment. Their advice was rejected and in January 1958, all the Treasury ministers resigned. Macmillan brushed aside this incident as 'a little local difficulty'.\nMacmillan wanted the new National Incomes Commission to institute controls on income as part of his growth without inflation policy; it failed when the trade unions boycotted it.\nOne of Macmillan's more noteworthy actions was the end of conscription. National Service ended gradually from 1957; in November 1960 the last men entered service. With British youth no longer subject to military service and with post-war rationing and reconstruction ended, the stage was set for the social uprisings of the 1960s to commence.\nMacmillan took close control of foreign policy. He worked to narrow the post-Suez rift with the US, where his wartime friendship with Dwight D. Eisenhower was useful, and the two had a pleasant conference in Bermuda as early as March 1957.  The amiable relationship continued with President John F. Kennedy after 1960. Macmillan also saw the value of a rapprochement with Continental Europe and sought entry to the Common Market. In terms of the Empire, Macmillan continued decolonisation, his Wind of Change (speech) in February 1960 indicating his policy. Ghana and Malaya were granted independence in 1957, Nigeria in 1960 and Kenya in 1963.  However, in the Middle East Macmillan ensured Britain remained a force — intervening over Iraq in 1958 (14 July Revolution) and 1960 and becoming involved in Oman. Immigrants from the Commonwealth flocked to England after the British Government posted invitations in the British West Indies, for Workers to come to England to \"help the mother Country\".\n\nHe led the Tories to victory in the October 1959 general election, increasing his party's majority from 67 to 107 seats.\nFollowing the technical failures of a British independent nuclear deterrent with the Blue Streak and the Blue Steel projects, Macmillan negotiated the supply of American Polaris missiles under the Nassau Agreement in December 1962.  Previously he had agreed to base sixty Thor missiles in Britain under joint control, and since late 1957 the American McMahon Act had been eased to allow Britain more access to nuclear technology. Britain, the US, and the Soviet Union signed the Partial Test Ban Treaty in autumn 1963. Britain's application to join the Common Market was vetoed by French President Charles de Gaulle on 29 January 1963, in due to his fear that 'the end would be a colossal Atlantic Community dependent on America', and personal anger at the Anglo-American nuclear deal.\nBritain's balance of payments problems led to the imposition of a seven-month wage freeze in 1961.   This caused the government to lose popularity and led to a series of by-election defeats. He organised a major Cabinet change in July 1962 but he continued to lose support from within his party.\nHe resigned on 18 October 1963 after he had been admitted to hospital for prostate trouble. He died 23 years later, in 1986.\n\nAlec Douglas-Home (1963–1964)\nMacmillan's successor was the Earl of Home, Alec Douglas-Home. However, as no prime minister had led from the House of Lords since the Marquess of Salisbury in 1902, Home chose to become a member of parliament so he could enter the House of Commons. He disclaimed his earldom and, as \"Sir Alec Douglas-Home\", contested a by-election in the safe seat of Kinross & West Perthshire. He won and is the only prime minister to resign the Lords to enter the Commons.  His demeanor and appearance remained aristocratic and old-fashioned, however. His understanding of economics was primitive, and he gave his chancellor Reginald Maudling free rein to handle financial affairs. Home's few domestic policies were not well received, but he did abolish retail price maintenance, which allowed consumers to find more bargains on sale.  He enjoyed dealing with foreign policy, but there were no major crises or issues to resolve. His Foreign Minister Rab Butler was not especially energetic.  Britain's application to join Europe had already been vetoed by de Gaulle, the Cuban Missile Crisis had been resolved, and Berlin was again on the back burner. Decolonisation issues were largely routine, and the Rhodesia and South African crises lay in the future.\nIn the 1964 general election, the Labour Party was returned to power under Harold Wilson. Douglas-Home became Leader of the Opposition. In July 1965, Edward Heath defeated Reginald Maudling and Enoch Powell to succeed him as Conservative Party leader. Enoch Powell was given the post of Shadow Defence Secretary and became a figure of national prominence when he made the controversial Rivers of Blood speech in 1968, warning on the dangers of mass immigration from Commonwealth nations. It is possible that the Conservatives' success in the 1970 general election was a result of the large public following Powell attained, even as he was sacked from the shadow cabinet.\n\n\"Thirteen Wasted Years!\"\n\"Thirteen Wasted Years!\" was a popular slogan attacking the Conservative record 1951–1964. Criticism came primarily from Labour. In addition there were attacks by the right wing of the Conservative Party itself for its tolerance of socialist policies. The critics contend that Britain was overtaken by its economic competitors, and was unable to prevent a troublesome wage-price upward spiral. Historian Graham Goodlad calls for taking a longer perspective. He argues that there were significant advances in transport, healthcare, and higher education. It is unrealistic to expect that Britain could have continued as a world power after the huge expense of the Second World War, and the independence of India and other colonies. Goodlad says the Conservative foreign-policy leadership properly adjusted Britain's world role by building an independent nuclear capacity and maintaining a leading role in world affairs, and anyway successive governments seldom did a better job.\n\nLabour Government, 1964–1970\nHarold Wilson\nIn 1964, Labour regained the premiership, as Harold Wilson narrowly won the general election with a majority of five. This was not sufficient to last for a full term and, after a short period of competent government, in March 1966, he won re-election with a landslide majority of 99. As prime minister, his opponents accused him of deviousness, especially over the matter of devaluation of the pound in November 1967. Wilson had rejected devaluation for many years, yet in his broadcast had seemed to present it as a triumph.\n\nOpen University\nWilson regarded with special pride setting up the Open University as a model for Europe. Plans were  drafted by Jennie Lee, the Minister for the Arts; she had Wilson's full support.  He saw the Open University as a major marker of the Labour Party's commitment to modernisation. He emphasised that it would strengthen a more competitive economy while also fostering greater equality of opportunity and social mobility. He especially favoured heavy use of technology, such as television and radio broadcast of its courses.  There were strong doubters and opponents in the  government and in commercial broadcasting; Wilson outmaneuvered them to get the budget approved, even though its sums proved far too small.\n\nVietnam War\nOverseas, Wilson was troubled by crises in Rhodesia and South Africa. The Vietnam War was a delicate issue, as President Lyndon B. Johnson urgently needed a symbolic British military presence. \"Lyndon Johnson is begging me even to send a bagpipe band to Vietnam,\" Wilson told his Cabinet in December 1964. Labour decided not to antagonise its strong antiwar element and refused Johnson's pleas. However, Wilson provided the Americans with intelligence, military weapons, and jungle training, and allowed some 2000 British soldiers to volunteer for service in Vietnam.\n\nIndustrial strike\nIn addition to the damage done to its reputation by devaluation, Wilson's Government suffered from the perception that its response to industrial relations problems was inadequate. A six-week strike of members of the National Union of Seamen, which began shortly after Wilson' re-election in 1966, did much to reinforce this perception, along with Wilson's own sense of insecurity in office.\n\nConservative Government, 1970–1974\nEdward Heath\nThe premiership of his successor, Edward Heath was the bloodiest in the history of the Northern Ireland Troubles. He was prime minister at the time of Bloody Sunday in 1972 when 14 unarmed men were killed by 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment soldiers during a banned Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association march in Derry. In 2003, he gave evidence to the Saville Inquiry and claimed that he never promoted or agreed to the use of unlawful lethal force in Northern Ireland. In July 1972, he permitted his Secretary of State for Northern Ireland William Whitelaw to hold unofficial talks in London with a Provisional Irish Republican Army delegation by Seán Mac Stíofáin. In the aftermath of these unsuccessful talks, the Heath government pushed for a peaceful settlement with the democratic political parties. In 1974, the Sunningdale Agreement was produced but fiercely repudiated by many Unionists and the Ulster Unionist Party ceased to support the Conservatives at Westminster.\nHeath took the United Kingdom into the European Communities, widely known at the time as the \"Common Market\" (later renamed the European Union) on 1 January 1973 after winning a decisive vote on membership in the House by 336–244, a majority of 112. It was, says biographer John Campbell, \"Heath's finest hour.\" Meanwhile, on the domestic front, galloping inflation led him into confrontation with some of the most powerful trade unions. Energy shortages related to the oil shock resulted in much of the country's industry working a Three-Day Week to conserve power. In an attempt to bolster his government, Heath called an election for 28 February 1974. The result was inconclusive: the Conservative Party received a plurality of votes cast, but the Labour Party gained a plurality of seats due to the Ulster Unionist MPs refusing to support the Conservatives. Heath began negotiations with the Liberal Party under Jeremy Thorpe to form a coalition, but, when these failed, resigned as prime minister.\n\nLabour Government, 1974–1979\nHarold Wilson (1974–1976)\nHeath was replaced by Harold Wilson, who returned on 4 March 1974 to form a minority government. Wilson was confirmed in office, with a three-seat majority, in a second election in October of the same year.  It was a manifesto pledge in the general election of February 1974 for a Labour government to re-negotiate better terms for British membership in the European Economic Area, and then hold a referendum on whether Britain should stay in the EEC on the new terms. After the House of Commons voted in favour of retaining the Common Market on the renegotiated terms, a referendum was held on 5 June 1975. A majority were in favour of retaining the Common Market.  But Wilson was not able to end the economic crisis. Unemployment remained well in excess of 1,000,000, inflation peaked at 24% in 1975, and the national debt was increasing. The rise of punk rock bands such as the Sex Pistols and The Clash were a reflection of the discontent felt by British youth during the difficulties of the late 1970s.\n\nJames Callaghan (1976–1979)\nWilson announced his surprise resignation on 16 March 1976 and unofficially endorsed his Foreign Secretary James Callaghan as his successor. His broad popularity in many parts of the Labour movement saw him through three ballots of Labour MPs, defeating the arch-Bevanite Michael Foot, the main left-wing candidate. Callaghan was the first prime minister to have held all three leading Cabinet positions – Chancellor of the Exchequer, home secretary and foreign secretary – prior to becoming prime minister.\nCallaghan's support for and from the union movement should not be mistaken for a left-wing position. Callaghan continued Wilson's policy of a balanced Cabinet and relied heavily on Michael Foot. Foot was made Leader of the House of Commons and given the task of steering through the government's legislative programme.\nCallaghan's time as prime minister was dominated by the troubles in running a government with a minority in the House of Commons; by-election defeats had wiped out Labour's three-seat majority by early 1977. Callaghan was forced to make deals with minor parties in order to survive, including the Lib–Lab pact. He had been forced to accept referendums on devolution in Scotland and Wales (the first went in favour but did not reach the required majority, and the second went heavily against).\nHowever, by the autumn of 1978 the economy was showing signs of recovery – although unemployment now stood at 1,500,000, economic growth was strong and inflation had fallen below 10%.  Most opinion polls were showing Labour ahead and he was expected to call an election before the end of the year. He decided not to.\nCallaghan's way of dealing with the long-term economic difficulties involved pay restraint which had been operating for four years with reasonable success. He gambled that a fifth year would further improve the economy and allow him to be re-elected in 1979, and so attempted to hold pay rises to 5% or less. The Trade Unions rejected continued pay restraint and in a succession of strikes over the winter of 1978/79 (known as the Winter of Discontent) secured higher pay, although it had virtually paralysed the country, tarnished Britain's political reputation and seen the Conservatives surge ahead in the opinion polls.\nHe was forced to call an election when the House of Commons passed a Motion of No Confidence by one vote on 28 March 1979. The Conservatives, with advertising consultants Saatchi & Saatchi, ran a campaign on the slogan \"Labour isn't working.\" As expected, Margaret Thatcher (who had succeeded Edward Heath as Conservative leader in February 1975) won the general election held on 3 May, becoming Britain's first female prime minister.\nHistorian Kenneth O. Morgan states:\n\nThe fall of James Callaghan in the summer of 1979 meant, according to most commentators across the political spectrum, the end of an ancien régime, a system of corporatism, Keynesian spending programmes, subsidized welfare, and trade union power.\nHistorians Alan Sked and Chris Cook have summarised the general consensus of historians regarding Labour in power in the 1970s:\n\nIf Wilson's record as prime minister was soon felt to have been one of failure, that sense of failure was powerfully reinforced by Callaghan's term as premier. Labour, it seemed, was incapable of positive achievements. It was unable to control inflation, unable to control the unions, unable to solve the Irish problem, unable to solve the Rhodesian question, unable to secure its proposals for Welsh and Scottish devolution, unable to reach a popular modus vivendi with the Common Market, unable even to maintain itself in power until it could go to the country and the date of its own choosing. It was little wonder, therefore, that Mrs. Thatcher resoundingly defeated it in 1979.\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nBarnett, C. (1972). The Collapse of British Power. London: Pan Books.

    "title": "Nigerian Television Authority",
    "text": "The Nigerian Television Authority or NTA is a Nigerian government-owned and partly commercial broadcast station. Originally known as Nigerian Television (NTV), it was inaugurated in 1977 with a monopoly on national television broadcasting, after a takeover of regional television stations by military governmental authorities in 1976. After a declining interest from the public in government-influenced programming, it lost its monopoly over television broadcasting in Nigeria in the 1990s.\nThe NTA runs the largest television network in Nigeria with stations in several parts of the country. It is widely viewed as the \"authentic voice\" of the Nigerian government.\n\nHistory\nEarly broadcast stations in Nigeria\nThe first television station in Nigeria, the Western Nigerian Government Broadcasting Corporation (WNTV) began broadcasting on 31 October 1959. Its first Chairman was Olapade Obisesan, a lawyer trained in the United Kingdom and the son of Akinpelu Obisesan, an Ibadan socialite and first president of the Cooperative Bank of Nigeria. Vincent Maduka, a former engineer, was the General Manager. The station was based in Ibadan, making it the first broadcast station in tropical Africa.\nIn March 1962, Radio-Television Kaduna/Radio Kaduna Television (RKTV) was established. It was based in Kaduna and was operated by the Broadcasting Company of Northern Nigeria. RKTV also provided coverage for the central northern states; it opened new stations on Zaria in July 1962 and on Kano in February 1963. Later in 1977, it was re-branded NTV-Kaduna.\nIn April 1962, the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) was established as a federal government-owned service based in the city of Lagos, broadcasting to the southwestern states.\nMidWest TV was established in 1972 as a TV broadcaster of Port Harcourt. It was run by the state government in Benin.\nBenue-Plateau Television Corporation (BPTV) was established in 1974 with headquarters in Jos. It was the first television station to launch regular/permanent colour broadcasts in Africa. The colour test transmissions began on 1 October 1975. BPTV was later re-branded as NTV-Jos.\nNTA was founded in 1977. By May 1977 all the state television broadcasters listed above were merged and re-branded as Nigerian Television (NTV) and owned by the Nigerian Television Authority.  Obisesan and Makuda continued in the roles of Chairman and General Manager of NTA. As of 1979, NTA had a national reach of 20% of the Nigerian population.\n\nEarly programming\n1977–1990: Networking locally produced content\nDramatic programming such as serials and anthology series were rare in regional television stations before NTA was founded in 1977. TV shows such as Moses Olaiya's Alawada on WNTV (later NTA Ibadan), Village Headmaster and Hotel de Jordan on NTA Benin became available more widely after the merger. Apart from these few notable shows, there was little original content in dramatic series production during the 1970s. By 1980, when the new NTA network took over state-owned broadcasting stations in the country, there was a concerted effort to increase the quality of locally produced content. NTA began offering support to the production of notable country-wide network programs such as Tales by Moonlight, Cockcrow at Dawn, and Mirror in the Sun as early as 1977. In 1982, a drama produced by NTA Sokoto, Moment of Truth won a prize at the fifth URTNA festival held in Algiers. \nTo cultivate interest in original broadcast content from Nigerian producers, the network set a ceiling of 20% broadcasting time to be allocated to foreign programming, during a period when the cost of acquiring those programs was much less than the locally produced ones. With just a portion of the broadcast week for schedulers to work with, foreign imports were routinely some of the most popular shows from the UK and the U.S., such as Yes Minister, Charlie's Angels, Dallas, Dynasty, and Falcon Crest. Cockcrow at Dawn, an agriculture promotional drama partially sponsored by UBA and produced by Peter Igho, who directed the award-winning Moment of Truth, emerged as one of the first nationally televised drama series in Nigeria. However, it was short-lived due to \"government structure syndrome\". Acada Campus, a show produced by Bode Sowande, was also short-lived. These series were widely available thanks to NTA's monopoly on broadcasting.\nIn the 1980s, a series of critically acclaimed soap operas were promoted on the network. The first was Laolu Ogunniyi's Wind Against My Soul, followed by For Better or Worse and Lola Fani Kayode's Mirror in the Sun. The last of these, produced in 1983, was well-received by critics, but its broadcast was interrupted after two years due to a lack of financial support. In the mid-1980s, another group of soap operas dominated the airwaves, including the short-lived Behind the Clouds and Turning Wheels.\nIn 1984, NTA began to broadcast Tales by Moonlight, a children's programme narrating traditional African folklore stories. The network also broadcast Adelia Onyedibia's adaptation of Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart in 1986.\nThe network also promoted notable comedy series during this period such as New Masquerade and Ken Saro Wiwa's Basi and Company. One of the earliest network comedies was House no. 13 (1984) starring Wale Ogunyemi;, a sitcom satirizing the social and urban lifestyle of Nigerians. Basi and Company, a critically acclaimed comedy series starring Albert Egbe was broadcast in 1985. Village Headmaster, Koko Close and Samanja, three series spoken in Nigerian Pidgin, were aired nationwide.\n\n1990s: Partial commercialization\nUnder the structural adjustment program initiated by the government of Ibrahim Babangida, NTA was required to commercialize some of its time slots in an attempt to move away from public broadcasting towards a partially commercial broadcasting network. This led to the addition of sponsored and brokered religious programs and the live transmission of weddings and funeral services on the network.\nNTA also continued to show acclaimed soap operas such as Mind Bending by Lola Fani-Kayode, Ripples by Zeb Ejiro and Checkmate by Amaka Igwe. Ripples, which began in 1988, became the network's longest-running soap opera, ending in 1993. Checkmate by Amaka Igwe, starring Richard Mofe Damijo, Bob-Manuel Udokwu, Ego Boyo, Kunle Bamtefa and Mildred Iweka, launched the career of many Nigerian celebrities. Following the end of Ripples and Checkmate, NTA promoted the shows Blossom and Fortunes, but these series suffered from declining viewership. At this time NTA, which previously had a broadcast monopoly, faced competition from new entrants such as Africa Independent Television. To compete, the network introduced prime time Latin American telenovelas such as The Rich Also Cry, Secrets of the Sand and Wild Rose.\nProgramming for children or for education usually occurred between 06:30 pm and 07:00 pm. Shows included Fun time, Readers club, Work it Out, and Take a Step.\nIn 1999, the network introduced breakfast television with A.M. Express.\n\nNews\nNews programming was central to NTA's and the government's efforts to forge national unity. The network ensured that news presenters did not simply read prepared scripts but acted as part of the news gathering team. As many of their early news writers came from print journalism, NTA made sure that writers understood the importance of writing for visual presentation. NTA introduced a new line of newscasters and reporters such as Ronke Ayuba, John Momoh, Cyril Stober, Bimbo Oloyede, Ruth Opia, Sienne Allwell-Brown and Sola Omole. Specialized news programmes like Frank Olise's Newsline were also introduced. The major news programmes were the Network News at Nine, a 5-minute News in Brief at 5:00 pm, and a 15-minute Newscap at 11:00 pm.\n\nIn the 1990s, NTA joined other state-owned stations in commercialising some aspects of news reporting by including festivals, social events, cultural and business activities in the news or as part of a news programme in return for the payment of a fee.\n\n21st Century programming\nAs of 2013, mandatory network programming dominated the airtime of most local NTA stations. The local stations were offered a choice of a local broadcasting time from a specific time range.\nDuring the daytime, magazine shows like A.M. Express, later renamed Good Morning Nigeria, aired for 2½ hours from 6:30 am to 9:00 am and from Monday to Friday, but other programs air once or twice every week. Network dramas like Super Story and Stand Up Nigeria were usually broadcast in the Tuesday and Thursday 8:00 pm slot. Notable sports programs include On the Pitch on Mondays.\nNTA, which previously had some original children's programming, formed a partnership with Viacom to broadcast Nickelodeon's programmes during its 5-7 pm time slot for children and instructional television in 2013, the agreement also included content provided by MTV Base.\nNTA also receives support from China, including the possibility of co-productions with Chinese state TV. Less frequently, its channels air content donated by Japan's JICA.\n\nNetwork News\nNTA's news mostly reports on government activities. The major news production is Network News, an hour-long news programme that airs from 9:00 pm Monday-Friday except on Wednesdays, when it is replaced with News Extra. Network News usually starts with news from the presidency, then news from the National Assembly, followed by ministries and state governments. Other news productions include News at 7 and Nationwide News at 4 pm. Investigative reporting and human stories are usually subordinate to covering government activities, with the exception of Newsline which airs on Sunday evenings. The 9 pm news programme has one of the network's highest advertising rates for 30-second ads. Paid news segments such as 'News of Special Interest' are inserted into network broadcast news such as Newsline or the 9 pm network news.\nOther notable news productions include Panorama, One O' Clock Live, Inside the Senate, and You and Your Rep.\n\nNTA branches and network centres\nAs of 2014, NTA had 101 stations in state capitals and towns of Nigeria, nine of which are network centres.These Network Centres can be found all over the various states of Nigeria.\n\nIn the past, there was a network centre in Ikeja, NTA Ikeja (channel 7), that existed from 1981 to 2000. There is also an NTA station based in Eket called NTA Eket, broadcast on channel 35, which was abandoned in approximately 2006 as of December 2023. The Nigerian House of Representatives later pushed to reinstate the station to full operations.\n\nCriticism\nNTA is partially funded through a state subvention. NTA has faced criticism that the content it covers is influenced by government and politicians. This interference is said to diminish the professionalism of newscasters on NTA.\nThe NTA has been criticized by performing artists such as Becky Umeh for allegedly pressuring her and other artists to align their expression with government propaganda goals. In an editorial on 18 October 2009, the Lagos newspaper The Guardian stated that \"the federal government-owned television network, the Nigerian Television Authority, (NTA) is arguably the largest of its type in Africa, but it is yet to have the operational freedom required to maximize its potential.\"\nIt has been suggested that the proliferation of NTA stations in every state capital is not useful for broadcasting but is driven by political reasons. The network has also been criticized for using antiquated technology.\n\nRelated services\nNTA's digital Pay TV service, Startimes, was established in 2010 as a partnership with Star Communications Technology of China. Additional NTA channels include NTA Yoruba, NTA Ibo, NTA Hausa, NTA Sports 24 and NTA Parliamentary Channel. In January 2013, it began deploying a subscription DVB-T2 system.\n\nInternational broadcast\nA number of NTA programmes can be viewed online via Africast as well as TelAfric Television in the US and Canada. NTA News bulletins are frequently aired on Africa Independent Television and BEN Television in the United Kingdom, where the station was also launched on Sky on channel 213 in 2008. It moved to channel 202 on 1 September 2008 to give space to new channels. In early March 2010, NTA refused to broadcast as a pay-per-view channel on Sky, and was removed from Sky EPG on the following day. The channel returned on Sky in the UK on 20 June 2018 on channel 781.\nNTA is also available on the IPTV platform SuncasTV, and via free-to-air satellite on Amos 17, SES 3, SES 5, Badr 7, Express AMU1, NigComSat 1R, Eutelsat 3B and Belintersat-1.\n\nNotable staff\nEugenia Abu - Newsreader and correspondent (Network News, Newsline), NTA Network\nMuhammad Kudu Abubakar - Newsreader (Network News), NTA Network\nArt Alade - Presenter (The Bar Beach Show), NTA Lagos\nChris Anyanwu - Newsreader and reporter, NTA Aba\nBen Murray-Bruce - NTA director-general (1999-2003)\nJulie Coker - Newsreader and presenter (Julie's World), NTA Lagos\nSadiq Daba - Producer and editor, NTA Sokoto and NTA Jos\nFunmi Iyanda - Sports reporter and presenter (New Dawn On Ten), NTA Lagos\nChuka Momah - Presenter (NTA Sports, Big Fight of the Decade, Sports Spectacular), NTA Network\nJohn Momoh - Newsreader (Network News and Tonight At Nine), NTA Network\nTade Ogidan - Producer/Director, NTA 2 Channel 5\nBoniface Offokaja - first Nigerian head of news department, NTV (1963- ?)\nOnyeka Onwenu - Newsreader and reporter, NTA Lagos; presenter (Contact and Who's On?), NTA Network\nNkem Owoh - Producer and newsreader, NTA Enugu\nBimbo Roberts - Newsreader (Network News), NTA Network\nCyril Stober - Newsreader (Network News), NTA Network\nAlex Usifo - Operations assistant/producer, NTA Benin\nRuth Benamaisia-Opia - Newscaster (Network News, Newsline)\n\nSee also\nBauchi State Television\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial site\nNTA Field Site",

    "text": "The 16th National Basketball Association All-Star Game was played on January 11, 1966, at Cincinnati Gardens in Cincinnati. The coaches were Red Auerbach for the East, and  Fred Schaus for the West. Much of the game would focus around the local team's three named All-Stars. Cincinnati's Oscar Robertson had been named the event's MVP in 1964, and Cincinnati's Jerry Lucas had been named MVP in 1965.  At game time, the East Division's top three teams, Boston, Philadelphia and Cincinnati, had the three best records in the league, with New York trailing far behind. This led East Coach Red Auerbach to name Cincinnati's Adrian Smith as a reserve and not New York's sharpshooting Dick Barnett, a source of some controversy at the time. The home crowd rallied behind Smith as he emerged as the game's star. It was Smith's only All-Star appearance, and he remains to-date the only one-time NBA All-Star ever named the event's MVP. The overmatched West suffered not just from poor shooting, but also from losing key All-Star Jerry West to an eye injury in the first quarter. The game was nationally televised, with an attendance of 13,653.\n\nEastern Division\nWestern Division\nScore by periods\nHalftime— East, 63–36\nThird Quarter— East, 101–68\nOfficials: Norm Drucker and John Vanak\nAttendance: 13,653.\n\nReferences\nThe Official NBA Basketball Encyclopedia.

    "title": "Key Club",
    "text": "Key Club International, also called Key Club, is an international service organization for high school students. Key Club International is the high school branch of the Kiwanis International family, classified as a Service Leadership Program and more specifically as a Kiwanis Youth Program. Many Key Clubs are sponsored by a local Kiwanis club.\nThe organization was started by California State Commissioner of Schools Albert C. Olney and vocational education teacher Frank C. Vincent, who worked together to establish the first Key Club at Sacramento High School in California on May 7, 1925. Female students were first admitted in 1977, ten years before women were admitted to the sponsoring organization, Kiwanis International.\nKey Club International began a 100-day countdown celebration leading up to the 100th anniversary in 2025 with celebratory events throughout the country prior to the Key Club International Convention.\n\nHistory\nOrigin\nIn 1924, the local Kiwanis Club decided to attempt to begin a service club at the Sacramento High School, and the school principal supported the idea and began searching for students willing to start the club. In May 1925, a group of boys at Sacramento High School held their first club meeting.\n\nInclusivity\nFemale students were first allowed to join in 1977 (52 years after the founding of the organization). This occurred ten years before adult women were permitted to join the parent (sponsoring) organization, Kiwanis International. \nIn 1980, the first females were elected to the Key Club International Board. Lisa Cross and Renee Wetstein were elected as Key Club International Trustees. In addition, the first African American was elected to serve on the International Board. Greg Broussard was elected as Key Club International vice-president. In 1996, Craig Melvin was elected as the first African-American president of Key Club International. The 2019 Key Club International Convention's House of Delegates voted to change all references of gender-specific pronouns (i.e., he/him/his or she/her/hers) to the neutral they/them/their pronoun set throughout all of the organization's bylaws. During the same session, the delegation passed a resolution to change the phrase \"...my nation and God...\" to \"...my nation and world...\" in the Key Club Pledge; the Kiwanis Youth Programs Board of Directors, directed by the International Guidebook to review any votes from the House of Delegates, approved the changes.\n\nPresent\nKey Club International is composed of 32 organized Districts with an additional District in formation (Western Canada). Key Club International is currently in 38 countries. As of 2020, Key Club International includes 229,652 members and 4,841 paid clubs.\nKey Club International itself employs three full-time staff members and utilizes the services of nearly 120 additional specialists employed by Kiwanis International—all are employed at Kiwanis International headquarters in Indianapolis, Indiana.\n\nActivities\nKey Club offers a range of services to its members: leadership development, study-abroad opportunities, vocational guidance, college scholarships, a subscription to the Key Club magazine, and liability insurance.\nIn 2002 Key Club officially adopted \"caring, character building, inclusiveness, and leadership\" as the core values of the organization.\nThe organization maintains partnerships with UNICEF, AYUSA Global Youth Exchange, the March of Dimes, and Children's Miracle Network Telethon. Through the partnership with UNICEF, a major initiative was launched in 1994 to address HIV/AIDS education and prevention in Kenya.\n\nTheme of the Major Emphasis\nAt Key Club International's first convention in 1946, the organization began to branch out internationally.\n\"Children: Their Future, Our Focus\" is Key Club International's Major Emphasis theme. Officially, any project conducted by members or clubs that serve needy children locally or globally is considered a project of the Major Emphasis. The three preferred charities of Key Club International are paramount to the organization's success in serving children. These are the U.S. Fund for UNICEF, March of Dimes, and Children's Miracle Network Hospitals. Key Clubs contribute to a global organizational total of more than 12 million hours of hands-on service and millions of dollars donated to the aforementioned partners and other programs.\nRecently, the Kiwanis International has dedicated itself to eliminating the risk of Maternal/Neonatal Tetanus (MNT) from the face of the earth. The disease plagues mothers and newborns in 40 countries worldwide, and while an effective vaccine has been developed, MNT claims nearly 100,000 lives each year. As part of the Kiwanis International mission to end MNT, Key Club International has pledged all proceeds from its members' Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF projects to the $110 million funding gap the Kiwanis International Foundation is working to correct.\n\nService Initiative\nThe Service Initiative is a program encouraging hands-on service to children aimed towards a common goal. It is changed every two years by the International Board of Trustees.\nThe 2004–2006 Service Initiative was \"Child Safety: Water, Bike and Car Safety\", where Key Clubbers participated in different educational events to try to spread safe habits to prevent accidental deaths.\nThe 2006–2008 Service Initiative was \"High Five for Health\". It is aimed at reducing childhood obesity and fighting a rising trend that appears to increase the risk of diabetes and heart disease.\nThe 2008–2010 Service Initiative is \"Live 2 Learn\". It is focused on 5-to-9-year-old youth, with the main goals of promoting education and building literary skills.\nIn 2011, the Service Initiative concept was abolished by a vote of the Key Club International Board. It was decided that the freedom of selecting any project in keeping with the theme of \"Children: Their Future, Our Focus\" would allow for greater success for member clubs and their dedications to service.\n\nKey Club Week\nDuring the first full week of November, known as Kiwanis Family Month, Key Clubs worldwide celebrate Key Club Week. In seven days, Key Clubs are encouraged to grow and serve through themed days like \"Show Your K in Every Way\", \"Konnect the Ks\", \"Kudos to the Key Players\", and more. The week has been designed to become the organization's primary membership drive worldwide with the belief that more members will translate to more service and further goals of adolescent support worldwide.\n\nColors\nThe official colors are blue, gold and white.   \n\n  Blue means unwavering character\n  Gold means service\n  White means purity\n\nStructure and governance\nThe Key Club District organization is patterned after the original Florida District and its parent Kiwanis Districts. These organizations hold their own annual conventions for fellowship, to coordinate the efforts of individual clubs, to exchange ideas on Key Clubbing, and to recognize outstanding service of clubs or individuals with appropriate awards.\nKey Club exists on more than 5,000 high school campuses, primarily in the United States and Canada. It has grown internationally to the Caribbean nations, Central and South America, and most recently to Asia and Australia. Clubs exist in Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, Australia, Bahamas, Barbados, Bermuda, Canada, Cayman Islands, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominica, Ecuador, England, Germany, Guadeloupe, Guyana, Hungary, Italy, Jamaica, Malaysia, Martinique, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Panama, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, St. Lucia, Taiwan, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Caicos Islands, the United Arab Emirates and the United States of America.\nKey Club International is an organization of individual Key Clubs and is funded by nominal dues paid by every member. Offices/positions are most often elected (or otherwise appointed by elected officers) and are held by high school students aged 14–18 years old.\n\nInternational\nKey Club International encompasses all clubs within the 33 organized Districts and in foreign countries that are not included in any specific District. Key Club International is led by the International Board of Trustees, which is typically composed of the International President, International Vice-President, and 11 International Trustees (Trustees being assigned to three Districts and also assigned to serve on various committees within the board). Furthermore, the International Council is composed of the International Board, as well as the District Governor from each of the 33 organized Districts. International Board members are elected at the annual international convention, also known as ICON.\nThe 2022-2023 International committees include the Executive committee, which focuses on bylaws and policies, proposals for the Kiwanis Youth Programs Board, International Competition, the Strategic Plan, and more; In addition, the global relations committee has a heavy focus on growth abroad, supporting international districts, and nondistricted/district-in-formation club communication. \nFinally, the programs and partners committee aim to connect Key Club International with other branches of the K-family, bridge the gap between KCI and our service partners, and to shape annual programs.\n\nDistrict\nA Key Club District is normally defined by state or nation and tends to match a similar Kiwanis District. Each District is chaired by a Governor, elected by delegates to an annual convention. The District is divided into Divisions which tend to, but do not necessarily match Kiwanis Divisions.\nEach District and District-in-Formation is led by a group of students comprising the District Board of Trustees. The Executive District Board commonly includes the Governor, Secretary, Treasurer (or Secretary-Treasurer), and Editor. Along with these positions, the Illinois Eastern Iowa District has a Statistical Secretary. Each District Board also includes one Lieutenant Governor per Division to serve the geographically smaller areas. Whereas one Governor may oversee the operations of an entire District (often the size of one or more states in the United States or a nation in the Caribbean), Lieutenant Governors oversee areas typically including 4–15 clubs. All officers are elected by the students they serve.\n\nGovernor (District Governor)\nThe District Governor is the highest-ranking student leader in a District and represents the District at all international events. Responsibilities include overseeing the District Board and ensuring the District's progress in its practical and fundraising goals.\n\nDistrict Secretary\nThe District Secretary's primary responsibilities include maintaining records for a District (meeting minutes, monthly report forms, etc.).\n\nDistrict Treasurer\nThe District Treasurer's primary responsibilities include preparing financial reports for a District, including but not limited to information about the progress of the District's Key Clubs in dues payment, and sending dues notifications to Key Clubs throughout the year.\n\nDistrict Secretary-Treasurer\nThe District Secretary-Treasurer's primary responsibilities are those of the District Secretary (maintaining records for a District) and District Treasurer (preparing financial reports and sending dues notifications). Districts without both a District Secretary and District Treasurer often opt for a District Secretary-Treasurer.\n\nDistrict Bulletin Editor\nThe District Bulletin Editor's primary responsibility is to produce at least two major District publications to be sent to all Key Clubs in the District.\n\nDistrict Webmaster\nThe District Webmaster's primary responsibility is to maintain the website for the District.\n\nDivision\nDistricts are divided into multiple smaller geographic regions which are typically called Divisions. Each Division is made up of several clubs and is usually led by a single Lieutenant Governor.\n\nLieutenant governor\nA lieutenant governor (LTG) is elected to lead and represent a single division in a district. The lieutenant governor serves as a liaison between individual high school clubs in their division and the district board. In addition to fulfilling the responsibilities of a Key Club member, lieutenant governors must also visit each of the clubs they serve, publish a monthly divisional newsletter, hold regular division council meetings or officer council meetings, collaborate with other lieutenant governors to organize training conferences, and keep in contact with their clubs, district executive board, and Kiwanis counterparts. A lieutenant governor may initiate community service projects to help the members of the division become more involved. A lieutenant governor may choose to create a division leadership team to delegate some of these responsibilities.\nThe lieutenant governor is responsible for oversight of, on average, 4–15 high school Key Clubs. Depending on the procedures and bylaws of their respective district, one of the lieutenant governor's duties may be planning an election near the end of their term to determine their successor.\nThe lieutenant governor's role on the district board is to act as a representative of their governing division. Lieutenant governors make up the majority composition of the district board, with over sixty members in some larger districts. Changes and adoption of policies are debated by the board and can be approved by a simple majority vote.\n\nClubs\nIndividual Key Clubs are the foundation upon which Key Club International is built; they are the direct or indirect beneficiary of all policy initiatives within Key Club International. The following are officer positions that Key Club International offers handbooks for: club president, club vice president, club secretary, club treasurer, club bulletin editor, and club webmaster.\nFinancially, every Key Club member pays $7 to Key Club International and up to $7 to their District through dues, depending on the District (for a total of up to $14). Club dues are paid through Kiwanis International's Membership Update Center. Key Clubs are assigned statuses by Kiwanis International indicating the timeliness of club dues submission, as shown in the following diagram:\n\nElections\nKey Club is one of the only internationally structured high school organizations led by high school students. There are four distinct levels in the organization's leadership hierarchy: International, District, Division, and Club. Some districts also have their divisions clustered in another optional structure called a Region, though this is not a standard part of a general district structure.\n\nInternational\nInternational officers are elected at the International Convention (ICON) each summer during the meeting of the House of Delegates.\nIn caucusing sessions held prior to the house of delegates, no more than two international president (IP) and international vice president (IVP) candidates and no more than 14 international trustee (IT) candidates are nominated for election. While only 11 positions for trustee are available, 14 are nominated for election; organization bylaws dictate that the minimum number of trustee candidates on the ballot “...shall not be less than the number to be elected plus one and not more than the number to be elected plus three...” notwithstanding cases of dual nomination of president or vice president candidates where the minimum number could increase up to 16.\nDuring international elections, district-endorsed candidates (no more than 2 from each district) for IP, IVP, and IT caucus in district-based rooms, sharing their platform and taking questions. After caucusing, Key Club members nominate 14 to proceed to the house of delegates. This number may be reduced if dual nomination for an IP or IVP candidate is considered. At the house of delegates, the international president, vice president, and 11 trustees are elected to the board by delegate votes.\nEach club present at the convention can send no more than two delegates to the house of delegates where, in addition to any resolutions or bylaw amendments to be considered, the international president, vice president, and trustees are elected. The current international board, all district governors, and all immediate past district governors are delegates at large, meaning they can vote independent of their club.\n\nDistrict\nDistrict-level positions are often elected at annual district conventions (typically held in March or April), where Key Club members, advisors, Kiwanis members, and guests are in attendance. Activities often include forums and workshops facilitated by district board members; awards and recognition ceremonies; a Governor's ball or banquet; a less formal dance; a keynote speaker; and several general sessions for remaining convention business. Caucuses, or questioning periods, are held to elect the new district officers (governor, secretary, treasurer, editor, webmaster, lieutenant governor, etc.) for the upcoming service year.\nMany districts name or brand their conventions differently in order to best reflect event goals. For example, a district convention is referred to as \"District Leadership Conference\" in the Missouri-Arkansas district, \"District Educational Convention\" in the New England district, \"District Leadership Training Conference\" in the New York district, \"District Convention/Leadership Conference\" in the Pennsylvania district and \"District Education and Leadership Conference\" in the Florida district.\n\nRegion\nA region may consist of multiple divisions, but they are not a construct of Key Club International bylaws. There are no internationally defined positions at the regional level. Implementations of regions may vary between districts that utilize them.\n\nDivision\nLieutenant Governors are typically elected at either a division level or at a district convention, though this varies depending on each district's bylaws. Division elections may also include divisional committees or other leadership roles, again varying by each district's own bylaws or preferences.\n\nClub\nThe president, vice president, secretary, treasurer, bulletin editor and webmaster (or technology-associated position) of the club should be elected each year in February. While not taking office until May, the intent of the early election is to allow for role-based shadowing and knowledge-transfer from existing officers over to officers-elect. In between club elections and the date that officers-elect assume their positions, there are district conferences or conventions where future officers can be trained and advised on how to best work in their upcoming role.\nThe webmaster has different duties depending on the District they hail from. The webmaster is typically responsible for creating, updating, and maintaining the district's website.\n\nNotable former Key Club members\nJensen Ackles, actor, director, singer/musician\nBrian Baumgartner, actor, director, producer, chili chef\nRichard Burr, Richard J.

    "title": "Piece by Piece (song)",
    "text": "\"Piece by Piece\" is a song written by American singer Kelly Clarkson taken from her seventh studio album of the same name. She co-wrote the track with producer Greg Kurstin. A midtempo pop song about restoring someone's faith in love and family relationships, Clarkson promulgated \"Piece by Piece\" as a sequel to the song \"Because of You\" (2004) but with a \"happy ending\". After a discussion with her sister about their family life, she introspectively co-wrote the song in a first-person narrative to her father, whose neglect of his family was used as a juxtaposition to her then-husband Brandon Blackstock's unconditional love for her and their daughter, whom they both promised to never abandon.\n\"Piece by Piece\" was first released as the second promotional single from Piece by Piece by RCA Records on February 24, 2015. Upon its release, the title track received praise from music critics, who commended its lyrical content as one of the album's highlights. Clarkson premiered the song in a live acoustic performance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and has showcased it on the set list of the Piece by Piece Tour. A re-worked version of the track was released to American hot adult contemporary radio stations on November 9, 2015, as the third and final single from the album. On February 25, 2016, Clarkson performed \"Piece by Piece\" in a live presentation on the fifteenth season of American Idol. The successful commercial and critical response of her performance on the program led RCA to issue an \"Idol version\" of the track on February 29, 2016.\nThe combined versions of \"Piece by Piece\" allowed the song to debut on the Billboard Hot 100 chart at number eight, becoming Clarkson's eleventh top ten entry and tying itself with \"Never Again\" (2007) as her highest debut on the chart. The track also attained the top position on three Billboard charts—primarily the Billboard Digital Songs chart, becoming Clarkson's 100th song to reach number one on a Billboard chart—a milestone in her musical career. \"Piece by Piece\" also peaked within the top 30 of the music charts of Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and Scotland. Clarkson later performed a reprise of the Idol version on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on March 3, 2016. The Idol version was nominated for Best Pop Solo Performance at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards. Following her 2022 divorce from Blackstock, Clarkson rewrote the lyrics in 2023 for live performances to reflect her new self-worth as a single mother.\n\nComposition\nOne of the five songs she had written for her seventh studio album, Clarkson co-wrote \"Piece by Piece\" with frequent collaborator Greg Kurstin, who produced the track. Clarkson has said about writing the song: A lot of the reasons why I wrote \"Piece by Piece\" was I guess I didn't realize the gravity of the situation until I had a child of my own, and until I experienced love like I do with Brandon (Blackstock) on the daily basis. I guess you don't realize something is missing until you feel it. I can't imagine walking away from my little girl. I can't imagine not having that love anymore. I didn't know it was missing because I never had it. It was a revelation and that's why I wrote that song. I think a lot of people go through that.\n\nLyrically, the song is a midtempo pop number about restoring someone's faith in love and family relationships. The song starts with a woman's recollection of her father abandoning his family; by the chorus, she finds a new man in her life, whom she describes as someone who, \"piece by piece\", had restored her \"faith that a man can be kind and a father could stay\". Written in a first-person narrative, Clarkson introspectively co-wrote the song to her father, whose abandonment of his family when she was six years old was utilized as a juxtaposition in contrast to her husband's unconditional love to her and their daughter, whom they had both promised in the song to never leave behind.\nClarkson pegged \"Piece by Piece\" as a follow-up song to her 2004 track \"Because of You\" and the album's \"most personal\" record, saying that \"once you've worked through that and you find love and the kind of happiness you hoped for but didn't really know was possible. It's a happy song. And it has a happy ending, unlike 'Because of You'\". She revealed that she was inspired to write it after a discussion with her sister about their relationships with their respective families. She remarked, \"I was talking to my sister on the phone about how sometimes girls with daddy issues don't find men like that!\". Clarkson also noted how their husbands were so supportive and loving in stark contrast to the cliché about people with \"abandonment issues\" dating \"losers\". She also said that \"Piece by Piece\" is a positive song, despite its somber resonance, and that she's still grateful to her father for making her want to be much more present in her family. Sonically, Jon Pareles of The New York Times compared it to the anthems recorded by U2. While Marissa Muller of CBS Radio described its sound as having a stadium feel with big drums.\n\nLyrics change\nIn August 2023, at her Las Vegas residency, Clarkson amended the lyrics from \"But piece by piece, he collected me up / Off the ground, where you abandoned things, yeah / Piece by piece, he filled the holes that you burned in me / At 6 years old and you know,\" to \"I collected me up\" and \"I filled the holes,\". The previous positive song is now a post-heartbreak empowering song as Clarkson switches from \"he\" to \"I\". Also, Clarkson switched the lyrics to the chorus from \"He never walks away / He never asks for money / He takes care of me / He loves me.\" to \"I just walk away / when they ask for money / I take care of me / 'cause I love me.\" This chorus change seems to address the main point of content: money from Clarkson's 2022 divorce settlement from Blackstock. In an interview on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, Clarkson admitted that she changed the lyrics because she found it difficult to sing the original version live while reliving the heartbreak she endured in the divorce, and added that the \"healing\" rewrite gave her some clarity and allowed her to evaluate her newfound self-worth and empower her fanbase.\n\nRelease and reception\n\"Piece by Piece\" was first issued as the album's second promotional single by RCA Records on February 24, 2015. Clarkson also revealed plans for the song to receive a single release. RCA then commissioned a re-worked version of the track for commercial release, which was serviced to hot adult contemporary radio stations on November 9, 2015 as the third single from the album. Following Clarkson's performance on American Idol, RCA issued an Idol version with Clarkson recording a similar performance in studio accompanied by a piano by Jason Halbert and produced and mixed by Halbert on February 29, 2016.\n\nCritical response\n\"Piece by Piece\" received acclaim from music critics, who praised it as one of the album's highlights for its lyrical content. Reviewing for Billboard, Jamieson Cox regarded the song as a raw and standout vocal showcase, saying that when Clarkson forges a real emotional connection with the track, it allows the album to transcend hammier and hackneyed moments in between. In his review for The New York Times, Pareles described it as the album's most accusatory song; and noted that despite the lyrical vulnerability, its music rises quickly to bombast, triumphal and glamorous but remote. He also lamented that those moments are far too few in the album. Writing for AXS on its release, Chase Hunt singled out \"Piece by Piece\" as the one that feels more natural than the rest of the album's tracks. He wrote, \"Songs penned by [Clarkson], or any artist writing their own songs, feels different. The track is letting fans into her soul while telling more of her story, past and present.\"\nKatherine St. Asaph of Time also highlighted the song as one of the album's stronger moments, describing it as a dagger to deadbeat dads everywhere that marks her most pointed lyrics since Stronger's \"You Love Me\" (2011). AllMusic's senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine also included it as one of the three tracks (along with \"Nostalgic\" and \"Good Goes the Bye\") that strike the correct balance of Clarkson's indomitable character and fresh electronic beats on the album's production. Jim Farber of the New York Daily News highlighted the song as one of the two (along with \"Someone\") that show Clarkson's flair for the passive aggressive put-down and help focus on her persona. Reviewing the album for The A.V. Club, Annie Zaleski also commended the track as one of those where Clarkson is far more engaging, and commented that the album could use more of that emotional complexity and personal connection.\n\nChart performance\n\"Piece by Piece\" made its debut chart appearance on the Billboard Adult Top 40 chart on the chart week ending December 19, 2015. It attained a peak position of number 32 and stayed on the chart for nine weeks. Following Clarkson's performance of the song on American Idol, Nielsen Soundscan announced that digital copies of the song had sold a total of 21,996 copies a few hours prior to the end of the tracking week ending on February 25, 2016, posting a 4777% gain from its previous week and allowing it to debut on the Billboard Digital Songs chart at number 35 and at number 18 on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart in the issue dated the week ending March 12, 2016. The following week, \"Piece by Piece\" made its debut Billboard Hot 100 chart at number eight, becoming Clarkson's eleventh Hot 100 top ten hit on the chart and tied itself with \"Never Again\" (2007) as her highest entry position on the chart. It also became her first song to reach the top 10 in since \"Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)\" reached number one in 2012. It also ascended to the top position on the Billboard Digital Songs chart and Pop Digital Songs chart with 210,000 digital copies sold and 3.1 million streaming activity, posting an 852% digital surge and 969% streaming gain while also becoming her 100th song to top a Billboard chart. In addition, the song re-entered the Billboard Adult Top 40 chart at number 33 and debuted on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart at number 23. \"Piece by Piece\" peaked at number nine on the Adult Pop chart, becoming Clarkson's fifteenth top-10 hit on the chart and set a record for the female artist with the most top-10s on the chart. Internationally, \"Piece by Piece\" debuted on the Billboard Canadian Hot 100 at number 17, on the Official UK Singles Chart at number 95, with an entry at number 37 on the UK Top Sales Chart, and on the ARIA Singles Chart at number 24. Following a performance of \"Piece by Piece\" by Rebecca Grace on The X Factor, the song re-entered the Official UK Singles Chart at number 27, attaining a new peak position.\nAs of September 2017, the song has sold over 813,000 copies in the United States.\n\nLive performances\nClarkson presented \"Piece by Piece\" in a short live acoustic performance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on March 2, 2015, and explained how she co-wrote the song. She revealed that the song's lyrical content had also made it hard for her to perform it live, saying \"It's not even the sad parts of it because I'm not there. I'm not in that place anymore, like where I'm sad about it. I'm in a very forgiving place about it and everybody's human. But I think I get really choked up because I just realize how lucky I am... And a lot of girls that grew up with their daddy issues and with not having that figure in their life, you know, take a very different road, and I just feel lucky that I'm not that girl.\" To promote the album, Clarkson had also performed the song in a stripped-down performance as part of her set list during her Piece by Piece Tour. On February 25, 2016, she performed \"Piece by Piece\" in a live performance a year after its release on the fifteenth season of American Idol. Her rendition of the song was met with a standing ovation from the audience and critical acclaim from music critics— with Olivia Waring Metro praising it as poignant while USA Today's Erin Jensen describing it as a \"heartfelt performance that we just can't get enough of\". On March 3, 2016, Clarkson appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show where she discussed her American Idol performance and closed the program with a rendition of the song.\n\nMusic video\nAn accompanying music video filmed by Alon Isocianu (who previously directed her \"Invincible\" video) was commissioned to promote the single and premiered on Vevo on November 19, 2015. The video, filmed entirely in a monochromatic black-and-white form, features Clarkson singing the song in an empty space, as well as tribute scenes to women of all ages—primarily to mothers, abandoned daughters, and pregnant women, ending with a scene of Clarkson carrying her own daughter.\n\nTrack listing\nSingle – radio mix\n\nSingle – Idol version\n\nCredits and personnel\nCredits adapted from the Piece by Piece liner notes and \"Piece by Piece\" metadata.\n\nRecording\nEngineered at Starstruck Studios, Nashville, Tennessee and Echo Studio, Los Angeles, California\nPersonnel\n\nCharts\nCertifications\nRelease history\nSee also\nList of Billboard Hot 100 top 10 singles of 2016\nList of number-one digital songs of 2016 (U.S.)\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nKing, Gayle (November 18, 2015). \"Kelly Clarkson shares story behind title track \"Piece by Piece\"\".

    "title": "Eighth Brigade (Syria)",
    "text": "The Eighth Brigade was a unit of the 5th Corps established in 2018 in the Daraa Governorate, Syria during the Syrian civil war, composed primarily of rebels who had reconciled with the Assad regime in 2018. The faction joined the Southern Operations Room in December 2024 following the 2024 Syrian opposition offensives and disbanded in April 2025 after the killing of Bilal al-Droubi.\n\nBackground\nThe Eighth Brigade originated as the Syrian rebel group Youth of Sunna Forces, which was initially led by Ahmad al-Awda until Mohammed Tohme and his deputy Bilal al-Droubi were given control of the group by the factions' leadership council in August 2016. Al-Awda regained control of the group and the city of Bosra later that month with the support of the Yarmouk Army.\n\nHistory\nFollowing a marked increase in regime activity in the summer of 2018, al-Awda negotiated a settlement with Russia and was given control of his own brigade. The faction worked closely with Russian military police and their joint area of control was more peaceful compared to other areas of the governorate.\nThe brigade fought against various Druze groups, including Sheikh al-Karama Forces, Al-Fahd Forces, Kata'ib Humat al-Diyar, Ma’an Zahreddin group, Karem Ubaid group, and Usoud al-Jabal group, in addition to the National Defence Forces (NDF), in September 2020 in Al-Mujaymer, as well as the \"outskirts\" of Al-Qurayya. 14 were killed, with 62 injured, on both sides. Members of the Men of Dignity were also injured in the clashes. The NDF established outposts in the aftermath of the clashes, on 4 October 2020. The Eighth Brigade withdrew from the area the following month, after negotiations held by emir Louay al-Atrash, as well as sheikhs Hammoud al-Hinnawi and Awad al-Miqdad.\nThe group clashed in Sayda in October 2020 with the Military Intelligence Directorate. Residents of \"Sayda, al-Nai’ma\" and Kahil, where settlements were reached in October 2021, requested that the Security Committee \"disarm\" those who were affiliated with the brigade. Russian military police met with Ali Bash, the deputy commander of the organization, on 11 October in Bosra, though the Eighth Brigade refused to hand over their weapons. The Eighth Brigade clashed various times with the Air Force Intelligence Directorate, including a raid on a Khirbet Ghazaleh checkpoint in December 2021 which was held by the directorate. Russia ended support for the group in 2021 and it affiliated with the Military Intelligence branch in Suwayda.\nThe Eighth Brigade raided a group on 5 May 2022 that was planning assassinations of Syrian Brigade Party members, under the orders of the Air Force Intelligence Directorate.\nThe Eighth Brigade and Central Committees were engaged in a 10-day operation against ISIS in the city of Jasim in October 2022. The next month, the brigade was involved in \"fierce battles\" with ISIS in various Daraa neighborhoods, including Tariq al-Sad and al-Mukhayam, alongside allied \"local factions.\"\nThe Eighth Brigade fought against the Moid al-Masalmah group in November 2022, which was claimed to have ties to ISIS. A citizen journalist group named the Horan Free League indicated that Louay al-Ali, the local head of the Military Intelligence Directorate, allowed ISIS into the area.\nThe Eighth Brigade and local groups clashed with ISIS in Nawa in January 2024, killing eight members of ISIS.\nIt fought against a Air Force Intelligence-affiliated group in Al-Musayfirah in March 2024, after an assassination attempt was made on a member of the Eighth Brigade. Two members of the Eighth Brigade died in the clashes, with three injured. One member of Air Force Intelligence died, while seven were injured. After the Air Force Intelligence-affiliated group was driven out of the city and fled to Umm Walad, locals formed an armed group and allied themselves with the Eighth Brigade. Clashes between the two groups also occurred later in the year, in September. The Eighth Brigade deployed reinforcements from Bosra.\nThe brigade joined the Southern Operations Room in December 2024, affiliated with the Syrian opposition and was one of the factions that marched on Damascus, leading to its fall that month.\n\nDissolution\nOn 10 April 2025, members of the brigade confronted Bilal al-Droubi, who had recently joined the Ministry of Defense, arresting him and shooting him multiple times. Al-Droubi died two days later.\nOn 11 April, following the attack on al-Droubi, large reinforcements from General Security were sent towards Eighth Brigade positions in eastern Daraa, taking control of checkpoints and confiscating weapons in Al-Sahwah, Al-Musayfirah, Saida, Al-Hirak, Ghabagheb, and Khirbet Ghazaleh. Later, Daraa governor Anwar al-Zoubi and other regional Syrian officials negotiated with Eighth Brigade leaders and local dignitaries in Bosra Citadel, reaching an agreement to hand over individuals wanted in killing al-Droubi.\nOn 12 April, General Security convoys carrying 1,200 soldiers entered the brigade's headquarters in Bosra to search for weapon depots and to transfer prisoners to Daraa city. An anonymous Eighth Brigade commander said that al-Awda considered fighting against the government, but decided against it because it would be a \"losing battle\". Additionally, hundreds of demonstrators demonstrated against the Eighth Brigade in Bosra, and mosque loudspeakers in several towns in eastern Daraa broadcast calls for pressuring brigade leaders into handing over those responsible for al-Droubi's death and for brigade members to hand in their weapons.\nOn 13 April 2025, Eighth Brigade spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Mohammed al-Hourani issued a statement announcing the dissolution of the Eighth Brigade, adding that it would hand over all \"human and military capabilities\" to the Ministry of Defense. Following this, General Security confiscated the brigade's heavy equipment, which included tanks, armored personnel carriers, and anti-tank weapons, from their headquarters in Bosra, and took control of facilities and prisons formerly run by the brigade.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "Byron McCandless",
    "text": "Commodore Byron McCandless (September 5, 1881 – May 30, 1967) was a longtime U.S. Navy officer who was awarded the Navy Cross during World War I and the Legion of Merit during World War II.  He was also prominent in the field of vexillology (the study of flags), and helped design two separate versions of the flag of the president of the United States.  He was the father of Bruce McCandless, also a naval officer, and the grandfather of NASA astronaut Bruce McCandless II. Commodore McCandless was later promoted to the rank of Rear Admiral on the retired list.\n\nFamily and early life\nByron McCandless was born in Endicott, Nebraska. His grandfather was David McCanles, who was killed by Wild Bill Hickok in 1861 at the Rock Creek Station, Nebraska shoot-out. His father was Julius McCandless (born 1851), who later moved his family to Florence, Colorado, where he operated a hardware store. (Florence had been founded by one of Julius' uncles, James McCandless, and named for one of James' daughters.)\nByron McCandless attended the Colorado School of Mines, and in 1899 played one season as quarterback for the University of Colorado football team.  He later went to the United States Naval Academy where he graduated in 1905.  He married Velma May Kitson (a daughter of May Kitson) on September 29, 1909.  Their son Bruce was born in Washington, D.C., on August 12, 1911.  The couple also had a daughter named Velma, born in Brooklyn, New York, on June 4, 1914.\n\nNaval career\nFollowing his graduation from the United States Naval Academy in 1905, McCandless sailed with the Great White Fleet on the USS Maine.  He was a gunnery and turret officer, and later became the flag lieutenant and aide to Rear Admiral Charles J. Badger, the commander of the Atlantic Fleet.  When Admiral William S. Benson became the first Chief of Naval Operations in 1915, he chose McCandless to be on his three-person staff.  Later, McCandless also became an aide to Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels.\nDuring World War I, McCandless commanded the destroyer USS Caldwell, and was awarded the Navy Cross.  His citation read:\n\nFor distinguished service in the line of his profession as commanding officer of the USS Caldwell, engaged in the important, exacting and hazardous duty of patrolling the waters infested with enemy submarines and mines, in escorting and protecting vitally important convoys of troops and supplies through these waters, and in offensive and defensive action, vigorously and unremittingly prosecuted against all forms of enemy naval activity.\nAfter the war, McCandless was the executive officer on the battleship USS Kansas. He later commanded the USS Parrott from 1921 to 1923, the oiler USS Brazos in 1927-28, and the cruiser USS Raleigh.  McCandless also commanded Destroyer Division 30 and served as the Operations Officer for Destroyer Squadrons of the Scouting Fleet.\nMcCandless attended the Naval War College, then became the Director of the Training Division in the Navy's Bureau of Navigation, and later headed the Branch Hydrographic Office in Boston.  After completing another course at the Naval War College, he served as the Chief of Staff for Destroyers, Battle Force, from 1935 to 1937.\nMcCandless became the commanding officer of the Destroyer Base, San Diego, in January 1937.  He was transferred to the retired list on June 30, 1940, but remained on active duty and in command.  He oversaw an expansion in scope of the base, adding fleet training schools and an amphibious force training unit, and accordingly it was renamed the Repair Base, San Diego, in 1942.  Helped by the addition of several floating dry docks, between 1943 and 1945 the base performed conversion, overhaul, maintenance and battle damage repair to more than 5,000 ships.  He remained the commander until the end of the war, leaving on September 8, 1945.  For his service at the base, McCandless was awarded the Legion of Merit.  He retired on September 25, 1946.\n\nDuring his career, McCandless made several inventions.  One of them was the \"Jeheemy\", an apparatus used to salvage landing craft swamped and stranded on invasion beachheads.  It consisted of portable crane hauled along the beach by a tractor.  McCandless also patented several other inventions, including a camera and other photographic equipment, a projection system, and a portable lamp.\n\nVexillology\nMcCandless developed in interest in flags, a field later called vexillology, and in 1917 was described by National Geographic Magazine as the \"foremost flag expert of the United States Government and probably the leading authority in the world on flag usages among maritime nations\".  McCandless authored almost the entire October 1917 issue of National Geographic, their \"Flag Number\", depicting nearly 1200 world flags in color and including a history of the American flag.\nIn 1923, McCandless discovered the 1779 Dutch sketches of the Serapis flag in the records of the Chicago Historical Society, removing any doubt as to what the flags actually looked like.\n\nIn 1915, Woodrow Wilson decided to design a new flag for the presidency, replacing the separate flags then in use by the Army and the Navy.  McCandless, the Aide to the Secretary of the Navy at the time, participated in the discussions along with Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt and Assistant Secretary of War Henry Breckinridge.  McCandless suggested a design which added four stars to the Navy's version (which used the Great Seal on a blue background), as this would be enough to distinguish it from the Army infantry flag.  McCandless then met with Wilson to demonstrate the proposed design; Wilson liked it but wanted to use the eagle from the presidential seal instead.  This became the final design, and Wilson issued Executive Order 2390 on May 29, 1916, to officially define it.\nIn March 1945, Franklin Roosevelt wondered if the four stars were still appropriate, given the creation of the five-star Fleet Admiral and General of the Army ranks during World War II.  Despite initial responses which recommended no change (the stars were not supposed to be indicative of rank), Roosevelt persisted and had a message sent to his old colleague McCandless, by this time a Commodore and commanding the Naval Repair Base in San Diego.  Roosevelt died on April 12 before McCandless could reply, but Truman still expressed interest, so on May 29 McCandless sent a long letter containing a history of the President's flag, dozens of attachments and several recommendations for a redesign.  McCandless primarily suggested using four six-pointed stars, each made up with twelve smaller stars.  The six stars would indicate a higher rank, while the 48 total stars would represent the states.  Truman (as a civilian) did not like the idea of designating rank, so instead requested a simple circle of 48 stars.  McCandless accordingly made up a new drawing with this design.  Further alterations (turning the eagle's head to its right, and changing the eagle to full color) were made by Arthur E. DuBois of the Heraldic Section of the Army's Office of the Quartermaster General (the forerunner of the Army Institute of Heraldry).  This design was used for the presidential coat of arms, seal, and flag, and was officially defined with Executive Order 9646 issued on October 25, 1945.  The accompanying press release discussed McCandless' role at length.  It is still the current design for the presidential seal and flag, as the only changes since have been to add more stars after Alaska and Hawaii became states.\nIn 1962, McCandless began writing an extensive book on the Flag of the United States in collaboration with Annapolis classmate Rear Admiral William R. Furlong, but died in 1967 well before the book was finished.  Furlong continued working on the book, and in 1971 turned over more than a thousand pages to the Smithsonian Institution, the sponsor (Furlong himself died in 1976).  Dr. Harold D. Langley of the Smithsonian eventually edited down the manuscript to a 260-page book, So Proudly We Hail: The History of the United States Flag, which was published in 1981.  Scott Guenther, an author of another flag book in 1990, ranked it along with a few others as \"seminal works of scholarship on the history of the American flag\".\nByron McCandless died on May 30, 1967, in Mariposa, California.  In 1971, the frigate USS McCandless was named in honor of both Byron McCandless and his son, Rear Admiral Bruce McCandless (who died in 1968).  There is also a street named after Commodore McCandless at the San Diego Naval Repair Base.\n\nAwards\nBooks\nMcCandless, Byron (1916). The Harbor of St. Thomas.

    "title": "Dancing on My Own",
    "text": "\"Dancing on My Own\" is a song by Swedish singer-songwriter Robyn, released on 20 April 2010 as the lead single from her fifth studio album, Body Talk Pt. 1 (2010), the first in her Body Talk series. \"Dancing on My Own\" was produced by Patrik Berger, co-produced by Robyn, and mixed by Niklas Flyckt, with Robyn and Patrik sharing writing credits. The song's stark mid-tempo electropop version from her album was the first version of the single released followed by a layered mid-tempo synth-pop edit designed for radio and a downtempo piano ballad recording for Radio 1's Live Lounge – Volume 5 later that year. It depicts a female protagonist in a crowded club just before last call who is dancing on her own while watching her ex-boyfriend, who she sought out, dancing with and embracing another woman, pondering confronting him for the last time before her time runs out. The song was inspired by situations Robyn observed while on her previous tour then clubbing throughout Stockholm, her favorite \"inherently sad gay disco anthems\", and the dissolution of her engagement.\nCritics praised \"Dancing on My Own\" as another bittersweet anthem for her song canon, with some ranking it as the greatest song of the year and eventually, the decade. Several reassessed its influence as Robyn's signature song, a gay anthem, and \"the ultimate sad banger\" of the poptimist movement, with Rolling Stone ranking her original album version at number 20 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time in 2021. \"Dancing on My Own\" became Robyn's first number one in her native country following its live premiere on Swedish TV show Sommarkrysset and also reached the top ten in Denmark, Norway and the United Kingdom later that month. Frequent collaborator Max Vitali directed \"Dancing on My Own\"'s Rosie Perez-inspired music video, first released on 21 May 2010, that showed Robyn portraying the protagonist in the song's lyrics in various club and rehearsal settings. The song later earned a nomination for Best Dance Recording at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards and was awarded Best Song at the Grammisgalan in Sweden. All three of her song's versions were promoted well into the following decade through multiple televised and streamed live performances and inclusion on many films, television series, and commercials.\n\"Dancing on My Own\" was covered by numerous artists and bands, with several releases, especially of Robyn's downtempo version. Inspired by the downtempo Southern rock ballad cover of it performed (but not released) by band Kings of Leon, a downtempo AC ballad by Britain's Got Talent contestant Calum Scott was most prominently released on 15 April 2016. Scott's cover was a moderate sleeper hit throughout Europe following substantial success in the UK, where it went viral on streaming services despite little initial radio play. Critical reception to it was polarized, with Robyn praising the cover but prominent music journalists comparing it negatively to her original. The first major test release by controversial London-based AI algorithm-based A&R start-up Instrumental, its formula in finding Scott and releasing his cover would go on to revolutionize major label signing based on early Internet engagement. An accompanying music video was released on 15 April 2016 that received over 400 million YouTube views in four years.\n\nBackground and creation\nDeep into sessions one \"dark\" week of November 2009 in Stockholm with longtime collaborator Klas Åhlund, Robyn's \"stormy\" engagement to Swedish MMA fighter and contemporary visual artist Olof Inger was starting to fray. \"Tired of the broken heart\", Robyn returned to writing about \"sad love\", a theme that remained prevalent in her work because it was universal, yet continued to give her fresh ideas. After launching her own pop-up club series in Hornstull Beach, Söder in January 2010, Konichiwa Bitches goes Tutti Frutti, modeled after Christian Falk's A Love Supreme, Robyn became inspired by DJing, clubbing and people-watching throughout Stockholm. Recalling how much the \"dance world\" had changed during the five years she spent promoting Robyn (2005), especially in America, Robyn realized it was finally ripe for exploitation: \"It's really going to have its time now and not just be looked upon as kitsch.\" Conceptualizing club culture, Robyn created narratives for past patrons she had seen from situations she had witnessed, including their \"expectations\" for the night to \"meet that person\", reach a \"good high\", or experience \"some kind of emotion\", revisiting stories from Olof on his time as a doorman describing how they'd act then reminiscing on her time in New York City in 1997 promoting Robyn Is Here as a \"lonely misfit teenager shoulder-shimmying alone in a gloomy corner\" on Club Vinyl's \"last ever\" Saturday night and Sunday afternoon, The Shelter, and the \"near mythological\" Body&SOUL, respectively. Robyn came to see clubs as \"an important place for our generation—almost like a church or a place where we go to experience something that's bigger than ourselves\", feeling it wasn't just \"cool\" but \"important\", and even \"utopian\", that \"in the middle of all these other people doing the same thing\" she could dance in her \"own space\" on her \"own terms\", wanting \"to make a song called 'Dancing On My Own'\" but still unsure \"what it was going to be about\". Following the example of the \"inherently sad, gay disco anthems\" she loved, including tracks by Donna Summer with Giorgio Moroder, Sylvester, Billy Idol's \"Dancing with Myself\" (1980), Ultravox's \"Dancing with Tears in My Eyes\" (1984), and Sheila E's \"A Love Bizarre\" (1985), the song's storyline eventually came to her, picturing \"the god-awful feeling of a woman who is watching her ex get with someone new at a club\".\n\"With an idea of a chorus in her mind,\" Robyn wanted to work further with Åhlund but couldn't stop \"toying\" with the song on her own, eventually reaching out to prior collaborator Patrik Berger for a \"different perspective\". Patrik had prepared for weeks before their first session at his Stockholm studio with a \"slew of electronic beats and tracks for Robyn to write over\". All of this was for naught as the first thing she said was, \"Can we sit down and write a song on an acoustic guitar today? I'm so tired of writing over electronic beats and tracks.\" Their first result was an \"acoustic 'campfire'\" demo with three chords in the manner of a country song. The chorus came first quickly, followed by the chords and parts of the melody. After days of \"fatten[ing]...up\" that demo, the two of them realized \"...they preferred the original and stripped it all back down\" again. Patrik, facing pressure from Swedish music industry insiders \"telling him what he should do\" with the song, decided for the first time that \"rather than following the pack\", he'd write and produce the song \"how he wanted to\", following a new group of \"sonic scholars\" in the country breaking away from Max Martin's \"school of pop\". Swapping \"the acoustic guitar for synthesizers with frayed edges and a beat that aimed for a TKO,\" Patrik went \"raw and gritty\", \"aiming for a 'window' of song\" that would capture its \"commercial appeal without destroying\" its \"myster[y]\".\nWith this third demo, entitled \"Right Over Here\", compared by Robyn and critics to Glasvegas' \"Geraldine\" (2008) and later heard in part in 2018 at the Red Bull Music Academy in New York, Robyn and Patrik had finally settled on a blueprint for the final track. A \"lot of time\" was spent subsequently on \"the individual components of the song: the drums, the bass and the pounding staccato it starts with\". Lyrically, Robyn and Patrik were \"super picky\" and took even longer. Obsessively trying to come up with the right words to not \"sugar-coat the experience\" of all of the \"messy moments of rejection,\" they both wanted \"uncomfortably honest\" lyrics designed to have each phrase read like a \"little poem\". \"Weeks\" were spent \"texting each other...on lines\" with \"a couple of days [spent] on each\" that filled a \"handful of notebooks\" by the end, with one entirely \"scrapped\", as \"every single word needed to feel right.\" Soon after completion of the song, Robyn became \"conflicted\" about having her collaborators and friends hear it. Recalling her excitement upon initially \"sending the demo to the record label and telling them I thought we had a good single\", its themes of \"nostalgia and sentimentality\" in retrospect came across like a \"teenage version\" of herself she was \"happy to let go of\". Robyn ended up deciding to include the song on Body Talk Pt. 1, working through \"difficult\" early promotion as the themes didn't \"always feel true\" to her.\nMany years later Robyn and Patrik realized their leaps of faith with the song were worth it. After \"taking a step back from what she'd created\", working through \"a lot of therapy\" where she \"worked on [...] and healed\" herself, then felt the \"song was talking back to her\" when \"thousands of fans\" sang it back to her on her 2019 tour when she \"cut the song just before the chorus\", she realized the song had \"moved on from its beginnings\" and was no longer \"conflicted\" about \"playing it live\", feeling it had become \"something that took on meaning for a lot of people in different ways\". Meanwhile, Patrik was reaffirmed of his decision to break from Max Martin's formula despite \"ang[er]\" from many of his peers in Sweden, as it became \"one of those songs where people came up to [him], talking about how much it mattered.\"\n\nComposition and release\n\"Dancing on My Own\" was composed by Robyn and Patrik Berger. Featuring \"elements of 'many different worlds'\" she loves that make her \"proud\" of the track, including \"80s rock ballads\" and \"queer electronica\", with the goal of releasing a record that would meet the standard of Prince, two versions of the midtempo ballad were released for the album then for radio, where \"everything, bar Robyn's vocal, is electronic\". A third, downtempo, 'pared down', piano-based version, recorded from her performance on 16 June 2010 on BBC Radio 1 was then released separately from the project on Radio 1's Live Lounge – Volume 5 on 22 October 2010. Both electronic versions keep a tempo of 117 beats per minute in common time, which NPR's Sam Sanders implies was arranged deliberately as it was \"situated [...] pretty close to what scientists say is the preferred walking tempo for humans\". All three versions are in the key of G♭ major, following an \"immediately familiar one-five-four\" chord progression of G♭5–D♭5–C♭5 and traditional ABABCB structure except for one pre-chorus line following its first verse and one outro line of a portion of its chorus following its choral refrain that concludes the song, with Robyn's vocals spanning from D♭4 to E♭5.\n\n The \"brutal\", \"direct\", and \"minimal\" electropop album version, the first version of the song released, leaked on approximately 19 April, then was released as a digital single the next day, followed by its official release on 1 June 2010 as Body Talk Pt. 1's lead single. Its focus is on its \"relentless jackhammer\" \"iconic throbbing bass backbone\" synth, made using the Korg Mono/Poly (MP-4) analog synthesizer. That is followed by the use of a \"kick drum\" on beats \"1 and 3\" and a \"snare\" on beats \"2 and 4\", both of which last through the entire song, accented with \"eight repeated, robotic, hihat quavers halfway through [beginning at 1:57], [...] little clave tinkles in the verses [1:36] and the odd crash cymbal\". A \"sad piano motif\" accompanies the song's \"middle 8\", the \"one moment in the track when you're allowed to pause\", then \"[at 2:45]...the pause is broken by 16 snare hits, all at maximum volume, with no crescendo or dynamic,\" followed by a return to the choral refrain that closes out the song. USC musicologist Nate Sloan highlighted the \"miracle\" of the \"lyrics [...] sparseness\" and the \"six seconds of silence between each line in the verse\" which he observed \"wasn't a lot of time in the abstract\" but \"eons\" on a pop song, which NPR's Sam Sanders felt Robyn left to let the listener \"live in that space – to give you time to insert all of your emotions and stories and feelings into the seconds between the lines\". The song's second synth-pop version, designed for radio and first heard accompanying its music video when it premiered on 21 May 2010, was released as a bonus track to Body Talk Pt. 1's iTunes release on 11 June 2010. It mixes those elements at substantially different levels and most noticeably adds \"an extra arpeggiated synth through the intro and the verse\". James Montgomery of MTV News described the radio version as \"a computerized kaleidoscope of chippy, chiming blips and piston-like drums.\" Vanyaland's Michael Marotta pointed out a small bell effect resembling last call that rings at the climax of the song in both electronic versions' middle 8, interpreting its inclusion as an indication the protagonist's time had run out in her last effort to gain notice from the ex-lover.\nRobyn's \"love letter\" to Stockholm as indicated in her \"favorite lyric\" describing its weather in winter, a \"big black sky over [her] town\", the song's \"bittersweet, voyeuristic narrative\" is of \"a woman dancing alone in a crowded club while her ex and his new lover look on\", with a deliberate \"bait and switch\" of production that sounds in its opening \"life-affirming\" but in reality is backing what the listener soon realizes is a \"bleak, wounded\" \"breakup song\" lyrically, a deliberate \"juxtaposition\" \"of light and dark at the same time\" whose \"magic\" Robyn explained to Kindness at Red Bull Music Academy is what she's \"drawn to when [she] make[s] music\", and is \"much more satisfying\" to her than just one feeling or the other, which she'd found \"predictable\" and \"boring\". NPR's Sam Sanders felt these contrasts of \"female empowerment through angst\" in \"lesser hands [...] might be confusing\" but \"[w]hen Robyn does it, it's human.\" Outside its story of the \"total outsider\" in \"love sickness\" \"in the middle of the club\" who's still \"going to take care of herself and have a good time even though she's pretty dramatic and crazy\", she left the rest of its narrative up for interpretation, explaining to Z100's JJ Kincaid that revealing every detail wouldn't have been \"as interesting\", preferring writing that brings out \"emotion[s]....in a way that enables the listener to [...] connect to [the song] in their own way\".\n\nMusic video\nThe music video for \"Dancing on My Own\" premiered via Robyn's official Vimeo account on 21 May 2010 and was released to YouTube on 28 May 2010, accompanied by its radio version. Directed by Max Vitali (who previously worked with Robyn on the second music video for her 2005 single \"Be Mine!\"), and choreographed by longtime collaborator Maria \"Decida\" Wahlberg, the music video was produced by Nils Ljunggren and HSI Productions, with filming by Erik Sohlstrom and editing by Johan Söderberg and Johan Wik. Wardrobe, hair, and makeup were done by Naomi Itkes, Ali Pirzadeh and Linda Öhrström, respectively.\nAccording to Robyn, Max, and 'Decida' from a behind-the-scenes black-and-white preview posted to Robyn's website the day before its release, it's meant to be a visually \"simple\" yet \"still...atmospher[ic]\" \"performance video\" aesthetically connected to her then \"upcoming gigs and tour\" that depicts \"being sad on a dancefloor\" in a \"rave\" or club\" where other \"people are dancing\" and Robyn's choreography is meant to \"[bring] out\" a \"pissed off [...] energy\". Robyn portrays the protagonist depicted in the song's lyrics while lip-syncing its lines in three scenes in the center of the club's dance floor, in a dark hallway of that club and in a separate \"harshly lit rehearsal\" setting. The microphone stand with no microphone in the latter setting BBC's Fraser McAlpine argued was a deliberate direction as a metaphor for the song's narrative. Robyn is occasionally watching her ex with another woman and trying to get his attention in both club settings prior to leaving – though not overtly, nor is there an obvious reference in the video as to who the ex and his girlfriend are among the club goers.\n'Decida' later explained to Billboard that \"angry\" choreography was inspired by \"her own experiences as a teenager\" channeling \"Rosie Perez’s dance sequence in the opening credits to Do the Right Thing (1989),\" while another choreographed moment of Robyn's \"making out with yourself dance\" where she turns \"her back to the camera\" and feigns intimacy with another person by \"wrapping her arms around herself\" was meant as a \"moment of levity\" from her \"serious-faced\" attempts to get her ex's attention, and she would continue to use both moves in subsequent live performances of the song. Reassessing her styling in the video with i-D years later, Robyn said she \"loved\" her wardrobes consisting of Philip Van De Roq jewellery chains attached to her ear and lapel, an altered Alexander Wang dress, and Sandra Backlund knitted armour, and only disliked her \"hair\", which she found \"ridiculous\", thinking she \"[wasn't] sure what we were thinking there!\"\nRyan Dombal of Pitchfork wrote of the video, \"When you're a star, sometimes all you need to do is put on a casually stylish outfit, gaze into a lens, move your limbs around in a rhythmic manner, and-- just like that-- a high-quality music video is born. Robyn is a star. And that's exactly what happens in this video.\" Leslie Simon of MTV Buzzworthy named it a \"Video You Need To Know\" and wrote, \"Amid a sea of strobe lights and PDA-stricken couples, Robyn seems cautiously fed up with dancing solo. Sad. We'll dance with you, lady!\" Jake Hall of Dazed saw the video's \"stand-out moment\" as accompanying the song's \"hammering drums transition into the final chorus\", when Robyn is shown \"ruthlessly throwing punches as strobe lights frame her wounded aggression.\"\n\nReception\nCritical\n\"Dancing on My Own\" received acclaim from music critics. Luke Lewis of NME praised it as \"a comet-trail of sadness and exhilaration that's easily the equal of Robyn's breakthrough hit, 'With Every Heartbeat.' Fraser McAlpine of BBC Radio 1 was stunned at the about-face from the \"fragile waif\" displayed in that prior song, praising Robyn's \"always [...] ready-packed\" voice \"with a whole world of pain and anguish\", the song's \"punishingly tough\" production and new narrative, and her \"toughness\" which \"lies in her ability to express total agony, and total assurance at the same time, via the medium of a plaintive chorus [...] \" Nick Levine of Digital Spy lauded the \"misty-eyed electro-disco tune\" he similarly found \"every bit as emotive\" as her singles from Robyn, including \"'Be Mine!' [...] If your bottom lip's not quivering like the bassline by the time the second chorus hits, you've taken waaay too many mood stabilisers [...] \"\nPitchfork's Ryan Dombal appreciated it showed \"the scuffs on her scepter\" in comparison to her promotional singles from Body Talk Pt. 1, awarding it their famous \"Best New Music\" label the day of release, and the outlet's Tom Breihan during its promotion would deem it her \"Euro-pop masterpiece.\" The Guardian's Michael Hann stated that song's \"pulsing synths and electronic percussion manage to sound both jackbooted and ineffably melancholy.\" Jer Fairall wrote for PopMatters that \"[t]he aggressive stun-gun rhythm of 'Dancing On My Own' can't hide a classic drama-played-out-on-the-dancefloor scenario inherited from standard bearers like ABBA's 'Dancing Queen' and Madonna's 'Into the Groove', nor is it cold enough not to melt at the touch of Robyn's warm, yearning vocals or the song's shimmering keyboard chime.\"\nSlant Magazine named \"Dancing on My Own\" the best song of 2010, writing: \"Few artists risk Robyn's emotional nakedness, and with 'Dancing on My Own' she reveals the exquisite flipside to her more empowered 'With Every Heartbeat'\". The Guardian named it the best song of the year as well, writing: \"'Dancing On My Own' is an extraordinary addition to Robyn's canon of skewed love songs; thoughtful and romantic enough for stuck-on-repeat listening, but with a pop sensibility that makes you want to head out in search of a dancefloor.\" Pitchfork named it the fourth best of 2010, saying that it \"demonstrate[s] she is the Rocky Balboa of pop music.\" Rolling Stone named it the twenty-sixth best song of 2010, writing: \"The Swedish diva spots her beloved with another girl – then turns her sadness into sparkling pop, perfect for solo freakouts.\" The song landed at number six on MTV's Best Songs of 2010, with James Montgomery writing: \"as soon as 'Dancing' gets to that hair-raising build – a breathless rush of drums and adrenaline – you're no longer thinking about what Robyn's saying, really.\" In January 2011, the American music magazine The Village Voice's Pazz & Jop annual critics' poll ranked \"Dancing on My Own\" at number three to find the best music of 2010. The song was nominated at the 53rd Grammy Awards in the category Best Dance Recording, but lost to \"Only Girl (In the World)\" by Rihanna.\n\nCommercial\n\"Dancing on My Own\" debuted at number two on the Sverigetopplistan chart on the issue dated 11 June 2010. The song ascended and descended between number two and number three over its first seven weeks, before reaching the top position on the issue dated 30 July 2010 where it remained for two weeks. The song became Robyn's first number one on the chart, as well as her seventh top-ten hit. It spent 18 consecutive weeks in the top ten and was present on the chart for a total of 40 weeks, finishing as the sixth best-selling song of 2010. In Denmark, \"Dancing on My Own\" debuted at number 33 on the issue dated 18 June 2010. After steadily ascending on the chart for several weeks, the song reached its peak of number two on the issue dated 6 August 2010. It has since then been certified platinum by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry in Denmark for selling over 30,000 units. In Norway, the song debuted at number six, which became its peak.\nThe song peaked at number 22 on the European Hot 100 Singles chart, becoming her highest-peaking solo song on the chart. On the UK Singles Chart, it debuted and peaked at number eight on the issue dated 26 June 2010, immediately becoming Robyn's best charting single in the country since \"With Every Heartbeat\" in 2007. \"Dancing On My Own\" also reached number three on the UK Dance Chart. In the United States, \"Dancing On My Own\" debuted at number 40 on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart. On the issue dated 17 July 2010, it reached its peak of number three and stayed on that position for two weeks.\n\nLive performances\nOn 5 June 2010, Robyn gave her live premiere of the track's midtempo version for Sommarkrysset on TV4 at the Stora Scenen in Stockholm's Gröna Lund amusement park. On 16 June 2010 Robyn premiered the downtempo version of the track on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge. The first live performance of the track on US television was on the Late Show with David Letterman on 19 July 2010. On 12 September 2010, Robyn performed a remix of the midtempo version with DJ deadmau5 at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, truncated by a commercial break. The two did not rehearse the performance until the morning of the show, and Robyn said, \"I met him for, like, five minutes, and then we were playing.\" In 2010–2011, Robyn performed the song on other American television shows such as Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, The Ellen DeGeneres Show Jimmy Kimmel Live! and Saturday Night Live. She also performed it at the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, Norway.\nOn 17 January 2011, Robyn attended the Grammisgalan to accept the awards for Best Song (for \"Dancing on My Own\"), Best Album, Best Female Artist and Best Composer. On 15 March 2011 she performed the song along with \"Fembot\" and \"With Every Heartbeat\" at Studio Hamburg, Germany as part of a promotional mini-concert for Deutsche Telekom's Telekom Street Gigs, later broadcast on ProSieben's We Love In Concert series.\nOn 14 February 2025, Robyn performed the track live with David Byrne at the SNL 50 Homecoming Concert at Radio City Music Hall.\n\nImpact and legacy\nAnticipation among several music journalists surrounding Robyn's social media announcement on 27 July 2018 of her first release of solo material in eight years, \"Missing U\", began a reassessment of the strength of her Body Talk series' \"anchor\", the original album version of \"Dancing on My Own\", and more broadly, its impact on other musical artists and the industry as a whole in the years that followed. In June 2018, Rolling Stone ranked that version of the song 19th on its list of 'The 100 Greatest Songs of the Century – So Far', in July 2018, NPR ranked it as the 49th greatest song by a female or nonbinary artist in the 21st century, and in October 2020, The Guardian's Alexis Petridis called it \"the greatest pop single of the past 20 years\". The track was considered the greatest of the decade by Rolling Stone, NME, Stereogum, Slant, Consequence, AP, Insider, Esquire, iNews, Vanyaland and Audiofemme. Time, NPR listeners, Paste, Good Housekeeping, The Interns and The Wild Honey Pie ranked it second, Pitchfork third, Elle and Treble fourth and USA Today ninth. Gorilla vs. Bear ranked it 12th, Crack Magazine 13th, NBHAP 15th, Uproxx 18th and Harper's Bazaar 22nd. In September 2021, Rolling Stone, from a poll of more than 250 artists, musicians, producers, critics, journalists and industry figures, ranked the original album version of Robyn's \"Dancing on My Own\" at number 20, between Billie Holiday's \"Strange Fruit\" and John Lennon's \"Imagine\", on their reissued list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\", the decade's highest entry on their list.\nReleased at what Harper's Bazaar's Natalie Maher deemed \"the height of the pop renaissance\" of the late 2000s/early 2010s, several columnists thought it took a decade for the song's influence to be appreciated critically due to the sharp contrast with its initial commercial reception, a result of several factors including its tone and theme. \"Seamlessly ushering dance music to the forefront of the pop continuum by making a record and a single that was easily adaptable to radio play but didn't alienate its raw emotions, delivering a certain edge and undeniable melancholia\", it arrived \"just when brainless EDM started taking off in the US\", and as Treble's Jeff Terich observed, \"the protagonist of every other pop hit from the early half of the decade [turned] a possible sexual encounter with a nightclub fling into the 'Most Important Moment on Earth,'\" (and Robyn reminded us that \"no, it doesn't always work out that way\"). \"Never touching the Hot 100\" as Pitchfork's Ryan Dombal noted Fawbert saw it taking \"another nine-and-a-half years\" to reveal its impact over the course of the decade after \"slowly unleashing its tentacles and hooking itself around the music world.\" The song \"heralded the end of the glitzy, VIP-filled, champagne-drenched 'Club' era of songwriting\" in Fawbert's view, and it \"changed the trajectory of pop, indie and dance.\" Insider's Callie Ahlgrim wrote that the song \"served as a lodestar for so much of this decade's pop\" when \"the best work of countless female pop stars\" that followed \"bears the mark of Robyn's signature poptimism\". Ahlgrim said that, without Robyn's influence, there would be \"no Carly Rae Jepsen, no Charli XCX, no Lorde.\" Max Martin's manager said that Martin thought \"Dancing on My Own\" was \"one of the best pop songs ever made,\" and years later at a dinner he told her that he continued to have a \"lot\" of female artists come into his studio, \"...put your album on the table,\" and say, \"I wanna make this!\" Robyn described his response as \"Well, fuck you, go work with her then!\" which she found \"very sweet.\"\nIn October 2020 The Guardian's Alexis Petridis detailed the track's \"brilliant electronic rebooting of the old disco trick whereby euphoric club music is paired with lyrical despair\" and Pitchfork's Jamieson Cox saw a similar dynamic when comparing her output to fellow Swedes ABBA for a September 2019 retrospective of their iconic greatest hits compilation released in 1992, expressing that she \"became one of this decade's great pop heroes by pinning down that same sad-ecstatic balance and welding it to modern, muscular production.\" NBHAP's Norman Fleischer also felt ABBA's anthem \"Dancing Queen\" had \"finally found a proper successor\" in Robyn's track. Seeing the domination over the music landscape by the close of the 2010s of this kind of song \"whose instrumental sets you up for good times, only to sucker punch your heart with lyrics of Biblical sadness,\" BBC's Mark Savage solely credited Robyn and the single, arguing the \"sad banger\" had clearly \"influenced an entire generation of songwriters.\" To that end, Lorde shared with Vice her \"friendly fixation\" with Robyn, including keeping a framed portrait of her on the piano during her performance of \"Liability\" on Saturday Night Live and in the studio as a \"patron saint\" to watch over the Melodrama sessions. Héloïse Letissier of Christine & the Queens, who presented Robyn with the award for Songwriter of the Decade, said that \"as a songwriter I can only marvel at a song like 'Dancing On My Own' ...it's a gem of pop.\" Pop stars Charli XCX and Zara Larsson acknowledged Robyn's influence, with Charli XCX expressing that \"Robyn has definitely been part of paving the way for pop stars who fall a little to the left of the Top 40 norm,\" and Larsson saying, \"She's what I strive to be in a sense of making my own choices and staying true to myself.\"\nBecoming what NME's Eli Hunt described as the \"queen of the misfits,\" Robyn has been described as a gay icon because of the popularity of \"Dancing on My Own\", itself described as a gay anthem. Robyn said she \"felt connected to the gay audience because there's an element to the culture that you have had to think about or make up your mind about what it is to be an outsider...\" By the late 2010s out singer/songwriter Sam Smith expressed that they thought the track made Robyn \"a huge part of the LGBTQ community because we get to dance our pain away.\" Rolling Stone ranked \"Dancing on My Own\" at number 20 on their list of \"25 Essential LGBTQ Pride Songs\", describing the song as \"deeply resonant to queer, marginalized people.\"\n\nFormats and track listings\nCredits and personnel\nThe liner notes of the album Body Talk Pt. 1 provide the following credits:\n\nRobyn – music, lyrics, co-production, instruments, programming\nPatrik Berger – music, lyrics, production, instruments, programming\nNiklas Flyckt – mixing\n\nCharts\nCertifications\nCalum Scott version\nBefore he became famous, British singer Calum Scott posted a cover version to his personal YouTube channel on 1 March 2014, and later performed the song for his audition on Britain's Got Talent in April 2015, the original clip of which has garnered over 415 million YouTube views. \"Naive about the [music] industry\" and worried his \"career was over\" after he wasn't signed to Simon Cowell's Syco Entertainment when \"the show was over and it went quiet\", Scott thought his \"opportunity was gone\". Tracking the data behind the sudden rise in engagement and speed of new subscribers to Calum's channel over several months, A&R executive Conrad Withey encouraged him to release the song officially. With Conrad's endorsement, Calum signed independently with Warner Music Group, and the song was released as his debut solo single on 15 April 2016, with a 3 June 2016 release in other territories under Capitol Records.\nWith this early exposure, Conrad's Instrumental, a London-based AI algorithm-based A&R start-up looking to streamline \"notoriously inefficient methods of talent discovery\" using internet engagement to cut costs with a \"data-driven\" platform that would controversially prioritize \"popular[ity]\" over \"artistry\" in support of \"online engagement\", \"internet stars\" and \"brand and content partnerships\" rather than \"musicians\", reversing preconceived notions of building fanbases from scratch by capitalizing on those that already existed, went on to contract their services with the 'Big 3' and revolutionize A&R signing of artists.\nScott's cover was noted for its \"soft focus\", with critical reception being polarized, and streaming performance being very strong in the UK and Australia, followed by sleeper hit longevity throughout Europe. Two EDM remixes of the cover were commissioned and released by Calum's label from Tiësto on 15 July 2016 and Hull-based Ben Dooks on 29 October 2018. Different music videos were commissioned and released later in 2016 for Calum's cover as well as the Tiësto remix.\n\nCritical reception\nReception to Scott's cover was polarized. Metro Weekly's Sean Maunier called it a \"stellar\" confessional, noting its \"subtle yet powerful\" slight lyric changes to \"reflect his own experience as a gay man\" that were \"casual\" yet still \"matter-of-fact, and all the more striking for it,\" Ones to Watch's Miro Sarkissian praised it as \"stunning\", and Digital Journal's Markos Papadatos found it \"crisp and haunting\". BBC Newsbeat's Steve Holden wrote that Calum's \"second lease of life\" he gave the song reached \"a far wider audience in the mid-2010s\", and Robyn shared with Steve she was \"super happy\" for Calum's success that got people to \"know the song a little bit more\", praising his \"voice\" and \"interpretation [...] in a way that 'made the song come alive again.'\"\nOn the other hand, both Noisey's Grace Medford and Dazed's Jake Hall wrote lengthy editorials harshly comparing Calum's cover to Robyn's original, similarly noting the irony of Calum pursuing the \"commercial mechanisms of the music industry\" which Robyn had rejected then lamenting his \"undeserved praise\" and \"chart dominating power [...] for casting a miserable, faux-ballad shadow over a well-crafted pop song\". The former excoriated it as \"the aural experience of walking knee-deep in wet cement\" with an instrumental that had \"all the exuberance of a John Lewis Christmas advert\", a \"nasal whine the likes of which have gone unheard since James Blunt\", and \"breathy\" syllables \"chomp[ed]\", \"overenunciat[ed]\" and \"split\" to sound more \"regional and everyman\", like the \"shy guy\" at \"open mic\", while the latter damned it with faint praise, arguing that despite his \"undeniabl[y] pure, talented, amazing voice\", the cover \"stripp[ed] the song of its initial context,\" deeming it a \"formulaic piano ballad\" that \"lost the duality which made the original so incredible.\" The Guardian's Alexis Petridis likewise felt his cover \"gormlessly sandblasted away the original's emotional complexity – a very realistic mix of despair, steely determination and euphoria – in favour of mournful bloke-at-a-piano emoting\" and Pitchfork's Jayson Greene also found it \"dubious\" and \"weepy\" in comparison to Robyn's.\nTiësto's remix of Calum's cover also had a polarized reception. USA Today's Bryan Kalbrosky dismissed it outright as \"inferior\", arguing there was simply \"no reason to listen\" to it \"so long as Robyn’s [original] exists\" while We Rave You's Petar Lazarevic appreciated how Tiësto \"slowly envelope[d]\" yet still left \"plenty of room\" for Calum's vocals, building \"the presence of the glossy guitar riffs in the drop\" which evoked \"the lazy and comfortable feelings that accompany the early hours of the morning after a fantastic night\".\nIn March 2018, Scott revisited the mixed reactions to his version. He said that those complaining he had ruined Robyn's song were counterbalanced by positive responses, for instance one person that had \"just written to me and said that they've come out to their family because of my interpretation\". He said he \"didn't change the pronouns of the song\" because he wanted the interpretation to always come from a \"gay man's perspective\". He said the gay community have thanked him repeatedly for the song, saying \"how much it means to them that they have a voice in music.\"\n\nChart performance\nThe cover went viral on streaming services, with Spotify tracking it reaching number one in six countries while ranking in the Top 10 in over 20, peaking at number 2 in the Global Viral 50. On iTunes it charted in the top ten in more than 12 countries. The track had its greatest reception in the UK, where, despite little radio airplay (apart from West Hull FM), it climbed into the top 40 and slowly reached number 4 in July. It was then added to BBC Radio 2's C List playlist and peaked at number 2 on the UK Singles Chart on 5 August. The track remained in the top three four months after its release and later that year it was revealed it was the most bought song of the summer in the country. Scott told the Official Charts Company on its reception there that he was \"absolutely over the moon\" at the news. The track went on to become the best-selling UK single by a British solo artist in 2016.\nIn the subsequent months and years, the track became a moderate sleeper hit in Europe, including by mid-2018 reaching 550M streams and becoming certified platinum in at least four countries. Scott said in a press statement upon signing with Capitol Records in the U.S. that \"when I recorded the song in my bedroom, I never thought for a second that it would reach as far as it has and bring this level of support from literally all over the globe...I'm completely overwhelmed by it all.\"\n\nMusic videos\nSelf-produced by Calum Scott and directed by Ryan Pallotta, the video for the original version was released on 15 June 2016. A crowd of silent people dressed in white are looking towards a light source. Among them, Scott mouths the song lyrics. A man and a woman move through the crowd to find each other. By April 2020 the video had received over 400 million YouTube views.\n\nThe official video for the Tiësto remix was commissioned by Capitol Records and released on 4 October 2016. Co-directed by Josh Killacky and David Moore, and edited by Alex Ditommaso, the video depicts a man pursuing a woman who is no longer his lover. With Moore shooting video while riding a hoverboard in a stark studio space, Josh Killacky and Haley Fitzgerald perform a modern dance routine, choreographed by Killacky.\n\nMedia\nThe cover aired on the 20th episode, \"Kill 'em All\" of The CW series The Vampire Diaries, broadcast 29 April 2016, while Caroline makes soup for Bonnie while ranting to Alaric about Stefan, commitment and closure. It also aired on the 24th episode, \"Ring of Fire\" of the ABC series Grey's Anatomy, broadcast 17 May 2017, while Nathan asks Meredith details about Megan, then hugs her in celebration and drives off. Scott promoted the track throughout 2016 and 2017 most notably on Late Night with Seth Meyers, Good Morning America, Elvis Duran and the Morning Show, Good Morning Britain, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, and Dancing with the Stars. Following the 10th episode \"Brainwave Jr.\" of the DC Universe series Stargirl in July 2020, the cover \"racked up 10.5 million U.S. on-demand streams, along with 3,000 digital downloads, according to Nielsen Music/MRC Data\", topping The Hollywood Reporter's Top TV Songs Chart. During the 2021 MLB postseason, the Boston Red Sox adopted the Tiësto remix of the song as their postseason anthem, playing the song in their celebrations after their Wild Card Game win over their rivals, the New York Yankees, and their series win over the Tampa Bay Rays. During the 2022 MLB postseason, the Philadelphia Phillies also adopted the Tiësto remix of the song as their own postseason anthem, with the team carrying it over into the 2023 season as well.\n\nAwards and nominations\nWeekly charts\nYear-end charts\nDecade-end charts\nCertifications\nOther versions\nBelgian singer Kato Callebaut performed Robyn's downtempo version as part of her audition on Idool 2011 then released her studio cover, receiving a gold certification for 10,000+ copies sold. American rock band Kings of Leon performed but never officially released a cover of Robyn's ballad during a session on Zane Lowe's show on BBC Radio 1. The cover was officially posted by the show to their YouTube channel on 10 September 2013, which Billboard's Jason Lipshutz described as an \"injection\" of Kings of Leon's \"muscular Southern rock stylings\" with \"meaty guitar riffs\", with \"Caleb Followill's signature growl in full effect\" and the \"'Whoa-oh-oh's' echo on the chorus\", recalling the singer's \"epic \"Use Somebody\" flare-ups\". Instinct's Jeremy Hinks slammed it as \"nails on a chalkboard,\" while Spin's Marc Hogan praised it as \"disarmingly effective\" and having brought out Robyn's \"smart songwriting\", noting their connection to her \"deeply conflicted relationship with mainstream success\".\nAmerican a cappella group Pentatonix released a cover of her mid-tempo version in July 2017 with a music video, presenting their first track as a quartet instead of a quintet. American actress Elle Fanning performed the mid-tempo version as the character Violet in the film Teen Spirit, released in September 2018, and her recording, described as \"unassuming\" yet \"impressive\" by MTV, was subsequently released in April 2019 as part of its soundtrack with a promotional music video depicting her role, aiming for pop stardom. Singer/songwriter Kelly Clarkson covered the downtempo version on 28 February 2019 in Dallas, Texas, on her Meaning of Life Tour. Robyn went on to tell Newsbeat in 2020 that she \"really liked\" Kelly's version, noting \"she has a really powerful voice. She recorded one of my favorite Max Martin songs, \"Since U Been Gone\", which I covered in the Radio 1 Live Lounge. So that's funny.\"\nAlternative rock band Grouplove released an indie pop cover of the midtempo version in March 2020, described as \"electric\" and \"passionate\" by Flood Magazine, promoting it on Cover Nation, Sirius XM and ALT 98.7. American folk singer Willie Watson, former founding member of Americana and bluegrass band Old Crow Medicine Show, released a folk version of the song in May 2020, dedicating it in a live stream performance of the song from his own studio to everyone \"dancing on their own\" amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. In December 2020 English singer/songwriter and model Karen Elson released a downtempo alternative country version on her EP, Radio Redhead, Vol.1. Los Angeles-based garage punk band the Regrettes released a cover of the midtempo version in March 2023. Tove Lo covered the song in October 2022 for Like a Version on Australian radio station Triple J with the cover subsequently being released on the station's YouTube channel as well as music streaming services. Canadian alternative rock band Arkells covered the song in May 2024 on their album Disco Loadout, Volume I.\n\nSee also\nList of highest-certified singles in Australia\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial music video (Vevo) on YouTube",

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.\n\nThe Butler-Wallin House, built in 1928-1929, is a one-and-a-half-story Period Revival-style residence. The house is significant under Criteria A for its association with the agricultural and suburban development of central Salt Lake County. The Butler-Wallin House was originally built as the showpiece of a 35-acre farm. The house and farm had several owners during the historic period, and each had different agricultural use for the property. The farm acreage land was sold for residential development between the 1950s and 1980s, but the house remains a distinctive reminder of the neighborhood's agricultural heritage. The Butler-Wallin House is a rare example of a farmhouse that represents a subset of second-generation Salt Lake County residents, the \"gentlemen\" farmers. Prosperous businessmen, who like Robert Butler and Alvin G. Wallin, kept their in-town jobs while maintaining suburban farms for hobby, experimentation, and educational purposes. The Butler-Wallin House is also significant under Criterion C as an architectural landmark in the area. The Butler-Wallin House was designed by the first owner, Robert W. Butler, whose avocation was architecture. The design of the house was derived from published plans for farmhouses, but adapted by Butler to produce a period revival hybrid of the English Tudor and Colonial Revival styles. It is the only substantial period revival-style frame house in the area. Thehome's beautiful architecture and lush landscaping made it a popular venue for weddings, receptions, and other\nsocial events during the historic period. The Butler-Wallin House and landscape contribute to the historic resources of its Salt Lake County neighborhood.\nIt has also been known as Butler Farm, as Wallin Farm, as Jensen Dairy.\nA three-space garage is a second contributing building on the property.\nIt is no longer a residence, has been used as a business location since the 1980s.\nIt is located on the northeast corner of E 4500 S and S 1025 E. in what is now Millcreek, Utah, which was incorporated in 2016.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "Interstate 85 in Georgia",
    "text": "Interstate 85 (I-85) is a major Interstate Highway that travels northeast–southwest in the US state of Georgia. It enters the state at the Alabama state line near West Point, and Lanett, Alabama, traveling through the Atlanta metropolitan area and to the South Carolina state line, where it crosses the Savannah River near Lake Hartwell. I-85 connects North Georgia with Montgomery, Alabama, to the southwest, and with South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia to the northeast. Within Georgia, I-85 is also designated as the unsigned State Route 403 (SR 403).\nI-85 in Georgia usually travels roughly parallel with the route of US Route 29 (US 29). However, from Atlanta northeast to South Carolina, I-85 ventures away from that route, traveling about halfway between US 29 and the combination of US 23 and US 123.\nWithin the city of Atlanta, I-85 has a concurrency with I-75 known as the \"Downtown Connector\". After splitting from Downtown Connector, it is known as Northeast Expressway until its junction with I-285 (The Perimeter).\n\nRoute description\nAlabama state line to I-185\nI-85 enters the state of Georgia from Alabama via twin bridges over the Chattahoochee River, and then it immediately skirts the town of West Point, with Kia's multibillion-dollar plant located adjacent to the freeway just east of West Point. After leaving West Point, I-85 enters the LaGrange area, the first large town in Georgia on its route to the northeast. Northeast of LaGrange, I-85 has an interchange with the long spur freeway, I-185, to the Columbus metropolitan area. This is the only connection between Columbus and the Interstate Highway System.\nAn 18-mile (29 km) stretch between the Alabama line and exit 18 in LaGrange is serving as an environmental and technological testbed for a project called The Ray, a partnership involving federal and state officials, the private sector, academia and philanthropic organizations. Among the projects are a solar-paved roadway, enhanced road striping for autonomous vehicles, and plantings along the right-of-way to improve runoff and possibly serve as a harvestable crop.\n\nFrom I-185 to Atlanta\nFrom LaGrange, I-85 heads northeastward toward Atlanta. Before reaching Atlanta, the highway crosses the CSX Transportation A&WP Subdivision twice (in the Grantville area) and passes through the suburbs of Moreland, Newnan, Fairburn, and Union City. The highway then intersects I-285 at its southwest end in College Park. This interchange is one of the most complex interchanges in the country, as I-285 and I-85 stay side by side through the interchange, which actually has two parts. The interchange also features many other, less important local access roads at the same time; meanwhile providing access to Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport. I-85 then runs along the northwestern boundary of the airport in East Point, providing access to the domestic terminal.\nAt the southwestern edge of Atlanta's city limits, I-85 merges with I-75 to form the Downtown Connector, which is 12 to 14 lanes wide. At the southern edge of Downtown Atlanta, this freeway has an interchange with the major east–west Interstate Highway, I-20. The two freeways then skirt the eastern edge of downtown, running due north, passing through the Georgia Tech campus and the Atlantic Station section of Atlanta before the two highways split, with I-75 exits via the right three lanes and then heads northwest while I-85 uses the left three lanes and then heads northeast.\n\nAtlanta to South Carolina state line\nHeading northbound after the Brookwood Interchange with I-75, I-85 is routed along a 10-lane-wide viaduct from the Buford Highway Connector (exit 86) to SR 400 (exit 87). Continuing northeast of Atlanta, I-85 continues through the northeastern suburbs, bypassing Chamblee and Doraville, where there is another intersection with I-285 (nicknamed Spaghetti Junction). The Interstate then travels through the northeastern suburbs of Atlanta, including Lilburn, Duluth, Lawrenceville, and Buford. The Interstate has freeway interchanges with SR 316 in Duluth and I-985 in Suwanee, which provides a link to Gainesville. Satellite Boulevard within Gwinnett County parallels I-85 to the west as an arterial frontage road.\nI-85 eventually leaves the Atlanta metropolitan area and narrows down to four lanes (two in each direction) past exit 149 as the highway continues into the rural parts of northeast Georgia. At Lake Hartwell, which was formed by the damming of the Savannah River, I-85 crosses the Savannah River into South Carolina.\n\nExpress lanes\nI-85 has the first express lanes in Georgia, located in Gwinnett and DeKalb counties; they were originally high-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV lanes). From Chamblee–Tucker Road (exit 94) to Old Peachtree Road (exit 109), travelers that utilize the converted 15.5-mile (24.9 km) lanes will be charged a toll varying from 10 to 90 cents per mile (6.2–55.9 ¢/km), depending on traffic conditions and usage. Though not signed on the freeway, they are high-occupancy toll lanes (HOT lanes), which means registered transport vehicles, carpools with three or more occupants, motorcycles, and busses are exempt from toll charges as long as they are registered as such. Tolls are collected using an electronic toll collection system. All travelers that use the lane must have a Peach Pass sticker to avoid fines. Starting in November 2014, SunPass (Florida) and NC Quick Pass (North Carolina) are interoperable with Peach Pass, allowing motorists with those transponders to use the express lanes.\nOn November 3, 2018, an extension to the express lanes opened, from its former ending at Old Peachtree Road to Hamilton Mill Road (exit 120). After this extension, four more northbound exit points were added: at SR 317 (exit 111), I-985 (exit 113), SR 20 (exit 115), and at its end at Hamilton Mill Road (exit 120). In addition, four new access points were added to the southbound express lanes: at SR 20, SR 317, Old Peachtree Road, and at the connection to the preexisting express lanes. The project costed $178 million (equivalent to $218 million in 2024). The express lanes extension will incur a separate charge from the existing express lanes. This is to decrease the impact of high congestion on the existing express lanes on the dynamic pricing of the express lanes extension, since lower congestion is expected on the new extension of the express lanes.\nFunds generated from the express lanes will be used to defray the costs of construction, operations, and maintenance of the lanes. Long-term revenue allocation is being studied and a decision about future excess revenues will be made later in the project process.\nProponents for the express lanes say it is to provide commuters with a more reliable, free-flow commute option; complement the state's multimodal approach to managing traffic demand; and establish the vision for a future system of HOT lanes in the region. Detractors point out that existing infrastructure was reused for the express lanes and that commute times on the nonpaying travel lanes have doubled since implementation.\n\nHistory\nOriginally constructed as a four- to six-lane expressway in the 1950s, the stretch of I-85 between the southern merge with I-75 and North Druid Hills Road was reconstructed as part of the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT)'s Freeing the Freeways program. This project included rebuilding all overpasses, new HOV-ready ramps (with the system implemented in 1996), and a widening of freeway capacity. Concurrent with this project was the construction of the Civic Center station as part of the West Peachtree Street overpass, which opened in December 1981.\nThe 30-mile (48 km) section between LaGrange and Newnan was incomplete for a much-longer time that the rest of I-85 in Georgia and required a two-lane detour on US 27 and US 29 between those cities. The northern section between Newnan and Grantville was completed first, then the stretch further south to LaGrange was completed in 1977.\nThe portion of the highway from the Buford Highway Connector to SR 400 was constructed during the early 1980s and was designed as a replacement for the original four-lane routing of I-85 (now SR 13). In addition, the new viaduct was designed to accommodate connections to the SR 400 tollway (then in planning), HOV lanes, and a bridge carrying the North Line (then under construction, now the Red Line).\nUntil 2000, the state of Georgia used the sequential exit numbering system on all of its Interstate Highways. The first exit on each highway would begin with the number 1 and increase numerically with each exit. In 2000, GDOT switched to a mileage-based exit system, in which the exit number corresponded to the nearest milepost.\nOn October 1, 2011, GDOT converted the 16-mile (26 km) HOV lanes in northern Atlanta into express/HOT lanes.\nFrom Atlanta, I-85 north was originally slated to be built through the city of Athens to provide an easy link between the capital city and the University of Georgia. However, then-Governor Ernest Vandiver worked to make sure the highway traversed his home county of Franklin, a stretch that now bears his name. At the time, he promised equivalent access for Athens and Gainesville. It was not until the completion of SR 316 in the 1990s that there was finally a relatively quick, multilane expressway connecting Athens and Atlanta, (US 78 is also multilane between Athens and Atlanta but it is not expressway-grade) although SR 316 still is largely at-grade.\nOn March 30, 2017, a fire started at approximately 6:15 pm in a storage area under the highway along Piedmont Road in the Piedmont Heights area of Midtown Atlanta. This caused the collapse of a 100-foot (30 m) section of I-85 northbound. The highway in both directions needed to be demolished and replaced. According to GDOT, the work was completed ahead of schedule. Both the north and south bound portions of the Interstate were open by May 15, 2017, a month ahead of expectations.\nIn May 2017, the Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners voted to accept about $6 million (equivalent to $7.53 million in 2024) in federal funds, to be used to acquire land to build a new diamond interchange on I-85 at SR 324/Gravel Springs Road between the interchanges for SR 20, and Hamilton Mill Road/Hamilton Mill Parkway. The board voted in July 2019 to accept about $20 million (equivalent to $24.1 million in 2024) in federal and state grants to pay for the construction of the new interchange. E.R. Snell Contractors was chosen to complete the work. Since an overpass already existed for SR 324, the entrance and exit ramps, deceleration lanes on I-85, traffic signals, and turn lanes were the main aspects of the interchange to be added. The main purpose of the new interchange was to provide another access point from I-85 to Mall of Georgia. Construction of the interchange began in early 2018 and was completed on November 23, 2021.\n\nExit list\nAuxiliary routes\nThere are three auxiliary Interstate Highways of I-85 within Georgia and a fourth that was proposed, and then cancelled. I-185 (SR 411) is a spur from LaGrange to Columbus. It mainly provides a freeway between the Columbus and Atlanta metropolitan areas. I-285 (SR 407) is a heavily traveled beltway around Atlanta, which helps I-75 and I-85 drivers to bypass the city. I-485 was a short freeway in Atlanta (now Freedom Parkway) that was incomplete for many years and then decommissioned due to local opposition. I-985 (SR 419) is a spur from I-85 to Gainesville.\n\nSee also\nGeorgia (U.S. state) portal\n U.S. roads portal\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\n Media related to Interstate 85 in Georgia (U.S. state) at Wikimedia Commons",

From the money she earned, she was able to educate her two eldest children at boarding schools in Sydney.\nLloyd was known as author of \"All Aboard\", a Christmas story published in The Echo when her first book was published in 1880. She dedicated this novel, The Wheel of Life, to Lady Robinson, wife of Hercules Robinson, then Governor of New South Wales. The Sydney Morning Herald critic reviewed it favourably, but chastised the proofreader for the number of printer's errors.\nIn 1881 the Illustrated Sydney News and New South Wales Agriculturalist and Grazier published Lloyd's  \"Silverleaf Papers\", a series of essays on topics such as \"New Chums\", \"Glimpses of Station Life\", \"Seasons of Drought\", \"Squatters versus Selectors\", \"Natives\" and two articles on housekeeping. The series continued under the monthly's new name, Illustrated Sydney News, with the publication of \"A Merry Christmas!\" and ran through 1882, including two essays on land legislation, which drew a response from Colin Macdonald in the Australian Town and Country Journal. Simultaneously, she wrote two serialised short stories, \"The Willoughbys\" and \"The Legend of the Red Bluff\" published by The Sydney Mail and New South Wales Advertiser.

    "text": "The Battle of Buaró (1886) was a military engagement fought in the fortified village of Buaró, Guinea-Bissau, between Portuguese colonial forces, led by Marques Geraldes, supported by Umbucu, and the forces of Fuladu, commanded by Musa Molo's chiefs.\n\nBackground\nFollowing the victory at the battle of Mansomine, Geraldes and his allies faced a risky situation. Despite the lack of reinforcements from the colonial governor, Gomes Barbosa, who refused to give support, Geraldes decided to press on. The region was tense, with the Umbucu rallying 800 auxiliaries to join 40 soldiers under Alferes Amaral Carvalho Vieira and 70 grumetes, forming a column of 910 men.\nMusa Molo was accidentally wounded, so his chiefs led his force, he anticipated the expedition and fortified a stronghold at Buaró, deep within the territory of Mansomine. The location was strategically chosen, and all régulos from the region coordinated their forces to repel the Portuguese column, there vigilant enemy scouts patrolled the terrain.\n\nBattle\nAfter setting camp at Cheuvel, Geraldes carefully planned his advance, avoiding paths prone to ambush. Guided by locals familiar with the terrain, the column approached Buaró undetected until they emerged from the jungle onto the plain where the fortified tabanca stood.\nThe battle began with a fierce exchange of fire as the Portuguese forces positioned their artillery on the column's left flank. An attempt to reposition the artillery closer to the enemy resulted in it being abandoned under heavy fire, with 5 grumetes severely wounded. Seizing the moment, the enemy cavalry launched an attack, forcing Geraldes to dispatch reinforcements to stabilize the line.\nReturning to the abandoned artillery, Geraldes and 4 soldiers managed to recover and reposition the piece. A well aimed shot from the artillery broke through the enemy defenses, killing six defenders. The remaining forces either fled or were cut down in close combat. After four hours of intense fighting, the tabanca fell.\n\nAftermath\nThe victory allowed Geraldes's forces to conduct a series of raids in the surrounding territory, destroying four tabancas over the next three days. The forces of Pata Jedé and Sambel Nhantá did not dare to offer resistance after the defeat at Buaró.\n\nReferences\n\nPélissier, René (1997).

    "title": "HTC First",
    "text": "The HTC First is an Android smartphone released by HTC on April 12, 2013. It was unveiled on April 4, 2013, as part of a press event held by Facebook. Serving as a successor to a pair of Facebook-oriented devices HTC released in 2011, it was the first and only Android device to be pre-loaded with Facebook's own user interface layer, Facebook Home, in lieu of HTC's own Sense.\nWhile considered compelling by critics for a mid-range phone due to its display quality and its optional use of stock Android beneath the default Facebook Home overlay, the HTC First was panned by critics for its poor camera and lack of removable storage, and was also affected by the similarly underwhelming reception faced by the Facebook Home software. AT&T, the exclusive U.S. carrier of the First, only reportedly sold over 15,000 units of the device, while both ReadWrite and Time named it among the biggest failures in the technology industry for 2013.\n\nDevelopment\nIn 2011, HTC released two low-end smartphones that provided integration with the social networking service Facebook, the keyboard-equipped HTC Status, and the larger slate HTC Salsa. The two phones featured Facebook's apps pre-loaded, along with Facebook integration within the HTC Sense interface and a dedicated Facebook key that could be used to provide quick access to sharing functions. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg endorsed the two devices in a pre-taped statement during their unveiling, and promised the possibility of more \"Facebook phones\" in the near future. Later that year, details began surfacing about a collaboration between Facebook and HTC known as \"Buffy\" (after the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer), a fork of Android that would be \"deeply social\".\nThe specifications of the phone was first leaked out by an HTC insider towards the end of 2012 that had claimed the device was then called \"Opera UL\" with a 1280x720 screen, and an Adreno 305 graphics processor with the Snapdragon 1.4 GHz CPU system on chip, which was later known to match the actual specifications of the final device.\nIn early 2013, reports indicated that HTC was preparing to unveil a Facebook-oriented smartphone with the revised codename \"Myst\"; this mid-range device was reportedly pre-loaded with a new Facebook-developed user interface layer known as \"Facebook Home\". Renderings of the new device leaked on April 3, 2013, revealing the design of the phone and its official name as the HTC First. Both Facebook Home and the HTC First were unveiled at a Facebook news conference held the following day on April 4, 2013. AT&T exclusively released the device in the United States on April 12, 2013.\n\nSpecifications\nHardware\nThe HTC First is a mid-range smartphone which uses a dual-core, 1.4 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor with support for LTE, a 2000 mAh battery, 1 GB of RAM and 16 GB of non-expandable storage. The First uses a 4.3-inch 720p Super LCD display, and includes a 5-megapixel rear-facing camera, and a 1.6-megapixel front-facing camera. The HTC First's exterior uses a rounded, minimal design with three capacitive buttons below its screen, and was available in black, light blue, red, and white color finishes.\n\nSoftware\nThe HTC First runs Android 4.1.2 \"Jelly Bean\" and Facebook Home, a new interface layer developed by Facebook that heavily integrates with the service. Facebook Home consists of a home screen and lock screen replacement known as Cover Feed (which aggregates content posted by friends on Facebook along with notifications from other apps), the ability to message users (via either Facebook or SMS) from any app using the \"Chat Heads\" overlay, and an overall experience that is oriented towards social interaction. The HTC First was also the first smartphone to include the recently acquired Instagram as a pre-loaded app. Although support for Facebook Home is not limited to the HTC First (it was also released for select HTC and Samsung models as well, and the Chat Heads feature was added to the standalone Facebook Messenger app), integration with certain system functions (such as the ability to display non-Facebook notifications on the lock screen) is exclusive to the First due to technical limitations. \nIf Facebook Home is disabled, the device reverts to a stock Android 4.1 experience; the First was the first HTC device since the T-Mobile G2 to offer a stock Android interface and not ship with the company's HTC Sense software.\n\nReception\nThe HTC First was released to mixed reviews. Dieter Bohn of The Verge gave the HTC First a 7.9 out of 10, receiving high marks in most categories except for its camera. Its design was considered to have a comfortable size and shape by contrast to larger flagship Android phones, and a display that was noted for its high resolution, good color reproduction and \"ridiculous\" viewing angles (but still being hard to use in direct sunlight). The First's camera was considered to be better than expected for a low-end phone, but produced \"muddy\" photos and \"[felt] like a throwback to an earlier age when smartphones were nigh-useless in the dark.\" Facebook Home's functionality was considered to be good for casual users, but the ability to switch back to a stock Android 4.1 interface was considered \"stunning\" and a good compromise for the lack of Nexus devices with LTE support at the time.\nAlex Roth of TechRadar gave the HTC First a 3.5 out of 5, praising its build quality and operating system (feeling that the First could \"develop a sort of second life as the mid-range of choice among Google geeks\" due to its use of stock Android and LTE support) and considering it to possibly be \"the last decent dual-core handset ever made\", but considered Facebook Home to be a \"glorified screensaver\", and also criticized the camera's low quality and the lack of a dedicated shutter button (which Roth believed would have made sense on a Facebook-oriented phone). \nOn May 13, 2013, reports surfaced that AT&T had only sold 15,000 units of the First since its launch, and was planning to discontinue the device in response to the poor reception of Facebook Home from both users and AT&T's sales representatives. The reports came shortly after AT&T had lowered the First's price from $99.99 to $0.99 on a two-year contract as a promotion; however, AT&T denied any possible connection to the device being possibly discontinued. In response to the issues, the release of the First on the British carriers EE and Orange was indefinitely delayed so Facebook could focus on making improvements to the Home software.\nIn December 2013, Time named the HTC First as one of the 47 \"lamest moments in tech\" for 2013, and ReadWrite similarly named it one of the \"Top 10 Tech Failures\" of 2013, stating that \"like Carrie Underwood in the remade Sound of Music Live!, the HTC First smartphone started out as an intriguing concept that attempted to shoehorn something very popular (Facebook) into a familiar vehicle (a smartphone). And like that live television event, it wound up being an undeniable disaster.\"\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website",

    "title": "Niccolò Brancaccio",
    "text": "Niccolò Brancaccio (Brancas, in French) (c. 1335/1340 – 29 June 1412) was born in the Kingdom of Naples, perhaps in Naples itself. He was Archbishop of Bari and then Archbishop of Cosenza, while serving in the Roman Curia in Avignon. He became a cardinal of the Avignon Obedience in 1378, and was Cardinal Priest of Santa Maria in Trastevere and then Cardinal Bishop of Albano. He participated in the Council of Pisa in 1409, and was one of the electors of Pope Alexander V and of Pope John XXIII.\n\nBiography\nNiccolò was the son of Marino Brancaccio and Giacoma d'Aversa. His elder brother Francesco \"Fusco\" was Signore di Laviano e Trentola, and his younger brother was Baffilo Brancaccio, Count of Anagni and Marshal of the Holy Roman Church. They were relatives of Bartolomeo Prignano (Pope Urban VI), on their mother's side of the family.\n\nEarly career\nHe obtained the degree of Doctor of Civil Law, probably from the University of Naples, and was given a Canonry in the Cathedral Chapter of Naples. He was named a papal chaplain (Monsignor) and Auditor Causarum Sacri Palatii (judge). He took his oath of office on 29 May 1366.\nHe was appointed Archbishop of Bari on 12 April 1367 by Pope Urban V. He became an intimate advisor of Queen Joanna I of Naples. He was transferred to the diocese of Cosenza on 13 January 1377 by Pope Gregory XI; his successor as Archbishop of Bari was Bartolomeo Prignano, who became Urban VI.\nIn April 1377, Brancaccio, Archbishop of Cosenza, and Matteo da Gesualdo were sent by Queen Joanna of Naples on a mission to the Signoria in Florence, to attempt to mediate in the war between Pope Gregory XI and the Florentine Republic. The embassy was not a success.\nNiccolò was in Naples when Prignano became pope in April 1378, and he was one of the ambassadors sent by the Queen to salute Urban as the new pope. When he had returned to Naples and heard that Robert of Geneva had been elected Pope Clement VII at Fondi on 20 September, the Queen and he immediately changed their obedience and supported Clement. In a deposition on the Schism, the Archbishop of Cosenza remarks that the Queen had no personal reason to prefer Robert of Geneva. Quite the contrary, there had been dissension between Robert and the cardinal of Bologna, the Queen's uncle. But the Archbishop of Cosenza was immediately sent on an embassy to Clement VII.\n\nCardinal\nNiccolò Brancaccio was named a cardinal by Pope Clement VII in his first Consistory for the promotion of cardinals on 16 December 1378, and was assigned the titular church of Santa Maria in Trastevere. At the time of his promotion he held the office of Regens Cancellarium, making him second-in-command to Cardinal Pierre de Monteruc, the Vice-Chancellor. In 1379 Pope Clement named Niccolò a Canon of the Cathedral Chapter of Lyon. Another of his benefices was the Priory of Luneil le Vieil. In 1379 Niccolò moved to Avignon along with the Papal Curia and Pope Clement.\nFollowing the death of Pope Clement VII on Wednesday, 16 September 1394, Cardinal Brancaccio was one of twenty-one cardinals who gathered in Conclave to elect a successor. The Conclave opened on Saturday, 26 September 1394, and concluded on Monday, 28 September 1394, with the election of Cardinal Pedro de Luna, who took the name of Benedict XIII.\nOn 1 March 1388 in Le Mans, Cardinal Brancaccio participated in the signing of the marriage contract between Louis II, King of Sicily, and Yolanda, daughter of the King of Aragon. On 18 April 1388 Cardinal Anglico Grimoard, Suburbicarian Bishop of Albano, died, and he was succeeded (c. 1390, according to Eubel) by Cardinal Brancaccio.\n\nTrouble with Benedict XIII\nOn 1 September 1398 at Villeneuve eighteen cardinals, among them Niccolò Brancaccio, published the retraction of their obedience to Benedict XIII. A few weeks later, after negotiations with the pontiff, they returned to their obedience.\nOn 29 June 1408, thirteen cardinals (who held the proxies of two additional cardinals) met in the port city of Livorno in Italy, where they prepared a manifesto, in which they pledged themselves to summon a general council of the Church to solve the problem of the Great Western Schism. One of them was Niccolò Brancaccio, Cardinal Bishop of Albano. When the Council finally met on 25 March 1409, Brancaccio was a prominent member of the Council. When the vote was called for on 10 May 1409 in the matter of deposing and anathematizing Benedict XIII and Gregory XII, the vote was nearly unanimous, except for Cardinal Guy de Malsec and Cardinal Niccolò Brancaccio, who asked for more time to consider. The sentence was finally read on 5 June.\n\nConclaves\nBrancaccio was one of the twenty-four cardinals who took part in the Conclave that was held during the Council, from 15 June to 26 June 1409. Cardinal Pietro Filargo was elected, and chose the name Alexander V. Unfortunately he survived only 10½ months, but during that time, in a gesture intended to heal the wounds of the schism, he issued a papal decree legitimizing all of the cardinals of all the obediences.\nThe Conclave to elect his successor took place in Bologna from 15 to 17 May 1410, and again Niccolò Brancaccio was one of the seventeen cardinals who participated. The Neapolitan Cardinal Baldassare Cossa was elected, and chose the name John XXIII.\nCardinal Niccolò Brancaccio died in Florence on 29 June 1412, and was buried in the church of Santa Maria Novella.\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nBaluze, Étienne (Stephanus) (1693).

    "text": "Paul Ryan (September 23, 1949 – March 7, 2016) was an American comic artist. He worked extensively for Marvel Comics and DC Comics on a number of super-hero comic book titles. He is best known for his 1991 to 1996 run as penciler on Fantastic Four, which represents his longest association with an individual comic book series. From 2005 until his death in 2016, Ryan penciled and inked the daily newspaper comic strip The Phantom for King Features Syndicate.\n\nBiography\nEarly years\nPaul Ryan was born in Somerville, Massachusetts, in 1949. He attended St. Polycarp Grammar School in Somerville, and graduated from St. Mary of the Annunciation High School in 1967. He graduated from the Massachusetts College of Art in 1971 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree in Graphic Design.\nAfter graduation Ryan enlisted in the United States National Guard and was assigned to Fort Dix, New Jersey, for Basic Training and AIT (Advanced Individual Training) in automotive mechanics. He later attended Massachusetts Military Academy in Wakefield, Massachusetts, for officer training. Ryan was a member of his National Guard pistol team, studied karate and fencing in his younger days, and at one time took up archery and weight training.\nAs a young man, Ryan found a job in the Graphics Department of Metcalf & Eddy Engineering in Boston, where he worked for 11 years.\n\nFirst steps in comics\nAccording to a 2007 interview, \"Ryan began his training [for a career in comic art] as a child, growing up in Somerville. He'd park himself in front of the television each night to watch George Reeves in the Adventures of Superman.\" Ryan began drawing one-page comic stories in grade school, inspired by his love of comics to create his own. He has said that as a youngster in the Silver Age, he was influenced by the work of Wayne Boring and Curt Swan on Superman. In 1961, Ryan became a big fan of the Fantastic Four of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, having \"bought the first issue at the tender age of 11.\" He has acknowledged that even as a youth he studied the work of Hal Foster, Sy Barry, Dan Barry, and Mac Raboy, adding \"I'm pretty much influenced by anybody whose work I admire.\"\nIn 1983, in response to a general \"open audition\" offer from Charlton Comics, Ryan was finally prompted to write and draw his first full-scale comics story, which he titled \"BREED\". Charlton had recently instituted a program whereby they would publish the best of the work submitted by aspiring comic book artists in Charlton Bullseye. Payment would be in the form of 50 contributor copies of the printed piece. The artist would then have published work to show Marvel Comics or DC Comics in the hopes of landing a job with the \"Big Two.\" Charlton accepted Ryan's story, encouraging him that a career in comics was within reach, but the title was cancelled before \"BREED\" saw print.\nThe remaining stories from Bullseye ended up in the hands of Bill Black of Americomics in Florida, and Black published \"BREED\" in Starmasters #1 (March 1984). This brought Ryan to the attention of comic book stores in the Boston area. When Marvel artist Bob Layton moved to Boston and needed an assistant, the employees at these stores recommended Paul Ryan to Layton. Ryan worked for Layton for a year doing his backgrounds, and through him met the editors and staff at Marvel. Layton is said to have played a vital role in Ryan's development. Ryan said that his only formal training in comics came in that 1983-1984 span, working as Bob Layton's assistant while also preparing his penciling samples for Marvel. By this time Ryan, having taken a circuitous route toward a career in comic art, was in his middle 30s.\n\nAt Marvel Comics\nSoon, Ryan was getting assignments of his own, starting with inking The Thing #27 (September 1985) and then moving on to penciling Iron Man #202, Squadron Supreme, The Eternals, and a Thor graphic novel.\nIn 1986, writer Mark Gruenwald and Ryan co-created D.P. 7 for Marvel's New Universe imprint. The series featured a then-uncommonly realistic view of what consequences could arise from having paranormal abilities. D.P. 7 has been called \"a clear forerunner — both in tone and content — of the television series Heroes.\"\nRyan said that his favorite creative moment in comics was sitting down with Gruenwald and coming up with the look for D.P. 7: \"At Mark’s direction we 'cast' our characters based on real people. This is something that I still do when confronted with new characters. When given a description of a character by the writer I look through various magazines for just the right look.\"\nRich Johnston of Bleeding Cool proclaimed D.P. 7 \"a wonderful comic book, everything just seemed to gel together perfectly on that series, and on Quasar that followed it, and I was hooked. Paul had a classically clean style.\"\nIn 1987 Ryan drew The Amazing Spider-Man Annual #21 which featured the wedding of Spider-Man (Peter Parker) and Mary Jane Watson. Recalling years later his reaction to being assigned the wedding issue, Ryan admitted, \"I was terrified! Excited, but knowing the historic and financial significance of this story for Marvel Comics, I couldn’t help but be a little nervous. Considering that I had only been in the business a minute and a half I should never have been given that assignment. Jim Shooter really took a chance with me. He asked. I accepted. He handed me the plot. I hope I didn’t disappoint him.\"\nRyan penciled the first six issues of Quasar in 1989–90, and also worked on a significant run of The Avengers. Recalling Ryan's work on the latter title, writer Jason Versaggi said that Ryan's \"draft work seemed to seamlessly transition from the end of John Buscema's stints on those books in the '90s.\"\nOther Marvel highlights included pencils for Avengers West Coast (shortly after inking John Byrne's art on several issues of that title) and Ravage 2099, a character he co-created  with Stan Lee. He penciled art for Byrne's scripts on Iron Man for about a year beginning in 1991, including an arc called \"The Dragon Seed Saga\" which featured the Mandarin. In 1992, concurrent with comic book projects, Ryan took over the penciling on The Amazing Spider-Man Sunday comic strip written by Stan Lee, inked by Joe Sinnott, and distributed by King Features. He drew that feature for just over three years, for what might have been his largest audience of readers.\nOf all his work for Marvel, Paul Ryan is most strongly associated with the Fantastic Four for his long run on their flagship title. Ryan said that when he was first offered the art assignment he actually declined, because he was reluctant to give up the Avengers to clear time in his schedule. He continued to think about the opportunity over a weekend, and finally concluded that he couldn't turn down the job of drawing his favorite Marvel title. Partnering with writer Tom DeFalco, and sometimes receiving a co-plotting credit, his first issue was #356 (Sept. 1991) and his last #414 (July 1996). He trailed only Jack Kirby and John Byrne in total number of Fantastic Four issues drawn. His run on Fantastic Four was ended abruptly by the Heroes Reborn event. Ryan recalled that he learned of his losing the F.F. and Jim Lee's taking over the title through the internet, and said, \"This whole situation left a bad feeling with me toward Marvel. I was cast adrift after 11 years of loyal exclusivity.\"\n\nAt DC Comics and after\nShortly after Paul Ryan left Marvel, he moved over to DC Comics where he became the artist on Superman: The Man of Tomorrow and The Flash. That same year, he was one of the many creators who contributed to the Superman: The Wedding Album one-shot wherein the title character married Lois Lane. Ryan drew part of the Superman Red/Superman Blue one-shot which launched the storyline of the same name which ran through the various Superman titles. He penciled a Superman Annual and various Batman titles, as well as several fill-in assignments on other Superman titles. With writers Grant Morrison and Mark Millar, Ryan introduced the Jakeem Thunder character in The Flash vol. 2 #134 (Feb. 1998).\nPaul Ryan and writer David Michelinie are the only comic book creators to have contributed to the wedding issues of both Spider-Man (Peter Parker) marrying Mary Jane Watson in The Amazing Spider-Man Annual #21 and Superman (Clark Kent) marrying Lois Lane in Superman: The Wedding Album.\n\"One of the greatest thrills I experienced working in comics was to be allowed to draw Superman,\" Ryan said about his time at DC. \"To me, he was the first, best hero.\"\n\nHe was a contributing artist on the NASCAR/Superman custom comic and on Celebrating the Century, a stamp collecting book which DC produced for the United States Postal Service.\nRyan briefly returned to Marvel in 1999, teaming again with writer Tom DeFalco, this time on the Fantastic Five. The turn of the Millennium found Ryan working with Wildstorm, penciling one of the Left Behind graphic novels, and working with Crossgen as a fill-in artist on such titles as Ruse and Crux. Crossgen's recruitment of Ryan and other notable talent led DC Comics to consider that upstart publisher a significant threat in the comic book market.\nRyan's involvement with The Phantom began when a fan bidding on one of Ryan's eBay auctions in 2001 contacted him, and asked if he had ever considered working for a comics company outside the U.S. This fan had been an intern at Egmont Publishing, which produces The Phantom (Fantomen) comic in Sweden. Ryan told him he was interested, and was given the appropriate contact information. Soon, the publisher had samples from Ryan, and he quickly signed him on to Team Fantomen. Ryan became a regular contributor of covers and finished interior art to Fantomen for the next five years, a job which would position him well for his next major assignment.\n\nThe Phantom comic strip\nThe Phantom comic strip began as a weekday newspaper strip on February 17, 1936, with a color Sunday strip added in May 1939.  It was originally written by creator Lee Falk, and when Falk died in 1999, Tony DePaul took over the writing duties. Paul Ryan was one of the several artists who have illustrated the character's comic strip adventures over the decades.\nIn 2005 then-current artist George Olesen announced his retirement. Jay Kennedy, editor-in-chief at King Features Syndicate, chose Ryan to assume the artist's role on the daily strips, beginning with those published in January of that year (Ryan had been the artist on King's Amazing Spider-Man strip a decade earlier). Then in October 2006 Graham Nolan, artist on The Phantom Sunday Strip, announced his intended departure from the series. Once again Kennedy called upon Ryan, who agreed to add the Sunday strip to his duties for King Features. His first Sunday appeared in newspapers on April 1, 2007. Ryan later wished to cut his workload and on July 31, 2011, Eduardo Barreto took over as artist for the Sunday strip. Following Barreto's sudden death in late 2011, Ryan returned to the Sunday feature briefly until a replacement, Terry Beatty, was found.\nOne of the many highlights of Ryan's time on The Phantom is the daily adventure that ran from August 24, 2009, until May 7, 2011. Called by DePaul in its entirety \"The Death of Diana Palmer Walker\", this epic storyline was considered at that time to be the longest in duration of all The Phantom newspaper plots. The recurring villain of the tale, Chatu, a.k.a. the Python, is a ruthless terrorist who seeks revenge on his nemesis by striking at someone close to the Phantom. Frew Publications later presented the entire story as \"The Python Strikes Back,\" which comprised the 140-page issue number 1602 of their long-running reprint series The Phantom. (In May of 2021, DePaul and Manley began an adventure called To Wrack and Ruin at Gravelines, which was the first part of a much larger story that subsequently surpassed \"The Death of Diana Palmer Walker\" in length.)\nDePaul credits Ryan with pitching the basis of another memorable story, \"The Challenge\", by posing the question, \"What if someone challenged Guran for the right to be chief of the Bandar?\" The story DePaul developed from that prompt ended with Guran still chief, but acknowledging the worthiness of his challenger, Kipawa, as a possible successor one day.\nRich Johnston praised Ryan for his artwork on The Phantom: \"Here it seems he has come into his own, a richer and more luxurious style that is less tempered by the effects of Marvel or DC editorial with a greater influence from Europe.\"\nRyan's last Phantom strip was released on Saturday, May 28, 2016.\n\nWorking methods\nSpeaking about his work as a comic book penciler, Ryan described his process: \"I read the stories and 'see' what it should look like in my mind, do a thumbnail sketch of the picture in my head and then go to full size drawing paper.\" Although known primarily for his pencil art for comic books, Ryan said that he preferred to ink his own pencils: \"I have worked with some amazing inkers. Some inkers made my work look better than it was. Some other inkers... not so much. When I ink my pencils, the readers get to see what I can do.\"\n\n On The Phantom, Ryan penciled and inked. When asked how long it takes to produce his daily comic strip, Ryan estimated \"four hours to pencil a strip and three hours to ink it in, crafting lighting and shadows.\" Ryan began with penciling only the line work. \"I work out the lighting, shadows and texture in the inking stage. I go in with the brush first and hit all the shadows and large dark areas. This helps define the page. Then I go in with a finer brush or pen to add details, texture or contour lines.\"\nRyan's art was characterized by a strong story-telling sense, careful attention to design and perspective, and solid knowledge of anatomy—on a strip that he at one time drew for publication 365 days a year. While Ryan kept reference books handy, he gave more credit to observation—and an artist's eye—for his knowledge of human anatomy as well as the structure of the world around us. \"Whenever I'm in any situation, I'll constantly try to memorize things. I'll memorize a face, a room, and actually mentally outline everything.\" He also took particular notice of shadows.\nDrawings of the real people in his life, such as family and friends, appeared in his comics. He said that his eye was especially drawn to the character expressed in older faces. \"You see so much history in the face. And that's something I try to bring into the work.\"\nRyan confessed to having run around his neighborhood as a youngster with a makeshift Superman cape tied around his neck (\"I got beat up a lot\", he joked), and his emotional identification with comic characters continued into his professional years: \"I find that while I'm illustrating a story I become so focused that I feel as if I'm [actually] in the story, taking the part of each of the characters as I draw them,\" Ryan said.\n\nLegacy, personal and professional\nRyan continued as the artist for The Phantom daily comic strips until his death at the age of 66. He died unexpectedly on March 7, 2016, at his home in Hudson, Massachusetts.\nTony DePaul, the writer of The Phantom, collaborated with Ryan on the strip for twelve years. He wrote of his last phone conversation with Ryan, who had called to make sure he interpreted a panel the way DePaul had intended in his script. DePaul lauded the ardent professionalism of his late partner, and stated that \"Paul considered it a privilege to work on a classic character created by the great Lee Falk, in 1936. He and I thought exactly alike in that regard.\"\nDePaul also wrote of their shared love for Montana, and of Ryan's love for horses. \"Which may be why,\" DePaul suggested, \"he was so good at drawing Hero, the Phantom’s trusty mount.\" DePaul posted photos of Ryan and his wife Linda Ryan enjoying a recent vacation at a ranch in Sweet Grass County, Montana.\nDePaul made reference in a 2017 interview to the \"magnificent work Paul did for so many years, and for way less money than he was worth\"; citing an example of Ryan's best work, DePaul said \"Paul’s art was especially well done in the 'Voyaging Canoe', night scenes at sea, in the fog, that can’t be easy to pull off.\"\nThe administrator of The Phantom fan site Chronicle Chamber marked his passing, and reminisced about meeting Ryan at the 2014 Supanova Con in Sydney, Australia, where he was the guest of honor at the Lee Falk Memorial Bengali Explorer’s Club dinner: \"My overwhelming memory of Paul was just how great a bloke he was. He listened to everyone who wanted to talk to him, he kindly signed all the stuff that was thrown at him and he was incredibly generous and honest in the tales he told about working on The Phantom. The highlight for me was watching Paul create some Phantom artwork live. It was amazing and something I’ll never forget.\"\nWriter Larry Hama, Ryan's friend and collaborator at both Marvel and DC Comics, praised him as \"an impeccable draftsman, a solid visual storyteller, and really, really nice guy.\"\nHama continued, \"I always knew that a plot I sent him would be drawn with a keen attention to detail, aspects of the story would be improved upon, and my mistakes would be corrected.\"\nMark Evanier reminisced: \"Some years ago, Paul and I were going to collaborate on a new comic book based on a leftover idea of Jack Kirby's. I was disappointed when the project fell through because I'd been looking forward to working with Paul. I knew from seeing his work he could draw well but when we got into discussions, I discovered what a smart, conscientious artist he was — the kind who not only produces fine work but understands what he's doing and why. What a shame to lose a good man like that.\"\nThat's Entertainment manager Ken Carson noted the many store events at which Ryan had appeared over the span of twenty years, and reflected on his personality and wit: \"He was a meticulous craftsman, but Paul enjoyed friendly banter as he sketched & signed for fans—and he had a mischievous sense of humor! He could say outlandish things with a straight face, but a sparkle in his eye would give him away.\"\nBrendan Burford (King Features general manager, syndication) eulogized the artist: \"Paul had an illustrious career in comics that spanned decades, and we at King Features are so pleased that he was able to ply his craft to our beloved PHANTOM. He belongs right alongside the other greats who have drawn the Ghost Who Walks, and he will be missed.\"\nThe King Features announcement also included some details of his personal life: \"In addition to his love of storytelling through his comics and his real true passion for being a cowboy, Ryan cherished spending time with his family and was fondly referred to as 'Uncle Paul.' His passion in life was his wife, Linda, and the treasured times they shared throughout their 28 years together in marriage.\"\nIn the weeks after Ryan's death, Frew Publications declared The Phantom issue number 1748 to be a \"Paul Ryan Tribute\" issue. This issue was Frew's first comic book to have the interior printed in color. In addition to a full-length adventure drawn by Ryan, the issue contained photographs from his 2014 visit to Australia and several remembrances. Publisher Dudley Hogarth therein attributed the following quote to Ryan: \"My heroes have always been men of action. Some of them wore a mask. Some rode a horse. Some had an animal companion. A few carried a gun. Fewer still operated from a secret cave. One hero, in particular, combined all of these elements and more. He was the Phantom! If someone had told me when I was ten years old, that I would one day be the Phantom strip artist, I would not have believed them. Those things happen to other people not to me. Life is good!\"\nMike Manley was named to succeed Ryan on The Phantom beginning with the strip dated May 30, 2016. Ryan was several weeks ahead on the strip at the time of his death.\nManley wrote, \"I met Paul only once that I remember clearly at a con many years back though we rubbed shoulders at Marvel on books like Quasar with me following him on that book when he left to do other books like The Avengers and The Fantastic Four. Paul left us all a great legacy to enjoy and be inspired by for the ages with his art for Marvel and his long run on the Phantom.\"\nManley also noted that he and Paul Ryan are listed in a small and notable group of artists who have professionally drawn the adventures of both Batman and The Phantom. The others are Jim Aparo, Terry Beatty, Don Newton, Carmine Infantino (as a ghost for Sy Barry), Joe Giella (ghosting for Bob Kane), and Graham Nolan.\n\nBibliography\nAC Comics\nCaptain Paragon and the Sentinels of Justice #1 (inker, letterer) (1985)\nColt Special #1 (inker) (1985)\nStarmasters #1 (writer/artist) (1984)\n\nCrossGen Comics\nCrux #17, 26–27, 31 (2002–2003)\nMystic #35 (2003)\nRuse #11, 15, 20, 25 (2002–2003)\nSolus #5 (2003)\n\nDC Comics\nEgmont\nFantomen #25/2001, 15/2002, 22/2002, 7/2003, 14/2003, 25/2003, 8/2004, 17/2004, 18/2004, 25/2004, 3/2005, 9/2005, 4/2006, 25/2006, 16/2016\n\nImage Comics\nC.H.I.X.

    "title": "Gaunt (band)",
    "text": "Gaunt was a Punk band formed in Columbus, Ohio, in 1991. The band released five albums before splitting in 1998.\n\nHistory\nThe original lineup formed from remnants of short-lived \"punkadelic\" band Black Juju, and consisted of guitarist/vocalist/songwriter Jerry Wick, bassist Eric Barth (who had also been in Two Hour Trip with the Spurgeon brothers, who would soon form Greenhorn), and drummer Jeff Regensburger (later of The Patsys). Jim Weber (also of the then newly formed New Bomb Turks) soon joined on second guitar only to leave just as quickly, and following his departure guitarist/songwriter Jovan Karcic (Waybald) joined. Barth and Regensburger would also later leave (in 1995) and be replaced by a series of successors including Bret Lewis and Brett Falcon (Space Cookie, Servotron) on bass, and Nick Youngblood (Beano, The Rackets) and Sam Brown (Feversmile, V-3, New Bomb Turks, The Sun, You're So Bossy) on drums.\nIn 1994, the quartet was signed to the independent Thrill Jockey and Crypt Records labels and their debut album, Sob Story, was produced by Steve Albini. A follow-up album was released in 1995, titled I Can See Your Mom From Here. The band had gained a loyal local following in the Columbus area, alongside other indie punk rock bands, such as the New Bomb Turks, Thomas Jefferson Slave Apartments, Monster Truck Five, and Pica Huss.\nIn 1995, Gaunt released a third album, Yeah, Me Too. The album was released by Amphetamine Reptile Records (the label had originally approached them to record a track for their Dope, Guns, and Fucking in the Streets singles series, which they did earlier in the year), produced by Tim Mac (Halo of Flies) - who would remain with the band for the rest of their career as live sound and pre-production engineer - and was recorded over the course of a few days.\nOne last album was recorded for Thrill Jockey, entitled Kryptonite, and released in 1996. Kryptonite was released with a metallic lime green cover and contained lyrics about Superman, Lois Lane, and lost love. Over the course of the next year, the band began to drift apart, with Wick recording solo material under the name Cocaine Sniffing Triumph. On August 20, 1997, the band signed to major label Warner Bros. Records, and they soon came together again. Despite recording  an album's worth of material in a Chicago studio, the band scrapped that material before recording 1998's Bricks and Blackouts. The album was considered to be a departure from their previous work, and although well received by critics, received little promotion and the band split shortly after its release.\nIn January 2001, Jerry Wick was struck and killed by a car while bicycling home. In 2005, Karcic and Brown opened a coffee shop called Yeah, Me Too, and Brown renewed his relationship with Warner Bros. Records as drummer and songwriter in The Sun.\n\nDiscography\nAlbums\nSob Story (1994), Thrill Jockey/Crypt\nI Can See Your Mom From Here (1995), Thrill Jockey/Crypt\nYeah Me Too (1995), Amphetamine Reptile\nKryptonite (1996), Thrill Jockey\nBricks and Blackouts (1998), Warner Bros.\n\nEPs\nWhitey the Man (1992), Thrill Jockey\n\nSingles\n\"Fielder's Choice\" (1992), Datapanik\n\"Jim Motherfucker\" (1992), Anyway\n\"Solution\" (1993), Snap!

    "title": "Salburua",
    "text": "Salburua is a wetland habitat on the eastern outskirts of the city of Vitoria-Gasteiz in the Basque Country in Spain.  The area, which is part of the city green belt, contains lakes, meadows and oak groves. It was drained in the 19th century to transform the area into farmland. Restoration work started in 1994 and has reversed this situation and now Salburua is a Ramsar Wetland  of International Importance. The Salburua marshes are considered to be \"the Basque country's most valuable area of wetland\", according to a Fedenatur report for the European Commission in 2004.\n\nHistory\nBefore 1857, the Salburua wetlands had at least three lakes: Betoño, Larregana, and Arcaute. The grazing, hunting and fishing were well known throughout Basque Country. Around Arcaute lake was an oak forest landscape characteristic of the Plains of Alava. In 1857, a process of draining the lakes and forest clearance was initiated with the aim of producing valuable agricultural land. This process continued into the 20th century when the last lake,  Betoño, was drained.\n\nWork began in 1994 on the recovery of the ancient landscape. At that time there was only a remnant of forest, north of Elorriaga, and a small wet patch near Betoño, in which the last animals and plants characteristic of these environments barely survived. Negative impacts on the area were included poaching, slums, and waste disposal. Ecological restoration work began with the reversal of the drainage of Lake Betoño. In 1998 a dam was built in the Canal de la Balsa to help this process. Through these activities it has been possible to recover an area of more than 180 hectares (440 acres), of which, at times of maximum flooding, 60 hectares (150 acres) are covered by water.\nThe restoration of Salburua serves as protection against flooding in the city of Vitoria-Gasteiz, which uses the lagoons and ponds. Since 1994 restoration work and landscaping in the vicinity of the lakes, and along water courses, have helped to recover some of the original wealth of Salburua. In addition to the ecological recovery, walkways, paths and bird hides have been provided.\n\nAtaria wetlands interpretation centre\nAn interpretation and information centre, Ataria, was opened in 2009. The facilities include an exhibition area, a café, auditorium and a cantilevered observation deck, which extends over a lagoon.\n\nBiodiversity\nThe flora includes a mass of well-preserved Carex riparia and other aquatic flora. Invertebrates include carabid beetles in different species with at least two endemic types. Small mammals include the European mink which is an endangered species. There is also a wide variety of amphibians. At present the greatest threat to these species is the arrival of invasive species. Large numbers of birds use the wetlands for breeding or wintering. The INBIOS Project aims to\nimprove populations of threatened species: bats, sand martins, waders, herons and otters; improve the conservation status of habitats, especially aquatic vegetation and the edges of ponds; combating invasive alien species of fauna, fish and American freshwater crayfish. Another objective is to conduct the first pilot project of reintroduction of European mink in the river ecosystems of northern Spain.\n\nFlora\nAlthough the most spectacular sight are the animals, Salburua also hosts a variety of vegetation, especially wetland species. Many of these species have managed to revive after the revitalization of wetlands. There are up to about thirty-five different species, including marshmallow, aconite, sedges and orchids.\n\nFauna\nApart from a herd of deer, introduced artificially to the marsh for vegetation control, all the wildlife that lives in the wetland is of wild origin. One of the most important carabid beetle communities of the Iberian Peninsula is present as well as one of the most comprehensive communities of amphibians and reptiles of the Basque Country. The strategic location on migration paths enables thousands of birds to visit by Salburua. Some of them are in the area through the winter and even choose these ponds for breeding, one of the world's most endangered carnivores, the European mink has been re-introduced.\n\nUrbanization\nThe wetlands are bordered by a large residential district of Vitoria-Gasteiz, which is still under development as of 2012. The northern part includes high bioclimatic towers and apartment blocks of 4-6 stories high. The runway of the former city airport, located right in the middle of the development, has become an avenue. It is a low density place and has approximately 7,000 residents. The Santo Tomas district is still under construction and will eventually have half of the population of the district, with about 16,000 inhabitants. The \"Gateway of Arkay\" will join the municipal boundaries and include the towns of Elorriaga and Arkay. Its development began in  mid-2010.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nWetland walks in Salburua\nGreen Belt of Vitoria-Gasteiz",

    "text": "The staðamál ('church-estate conflict') was a conflict between the bishops and secular aristocrats of Iceland over the control of proprietary churches which the arisocrats had established on their own estates and viewed as their own property (thus receiving part of the tithes pertaining to them).\nThe staðamál proceeded in two waves. First, the year after Þorlákur helgi Þórhallsson became bishop of Skálholt in 1178, he began to demand control over ecclesiastical estates, following the reforms of Archbishop Eysteinn Erlendsson of Niðarós. This staðamál concluded with Þorlákur seizing control over a number of ecclesiastical estates, but otherwise little changed except that it became clear to aristocrats that the Church did not view their control of proprietary churches as legal.\nThe later staðamál began when Bishop Árni Þorláksson of Skálholt (who earned himself the nickname \"Staða-Árni\") undertook a further reorganisation of the local church, known as Kristnirétt Árna, in 1275. This concluded with a special settlement between Árni and Iceland's secular aristocrats in Ögvaldsnes in Norway in 1297, under the leadership of Jörundur Þorsteinsson and King Eiríkur Magnússon. It was decided that those establishments where the disputants owned half of the revenues or more should remain in the control of their former owners, but that the remainder should pass to the bishop. In this way, the Church gained independence from secular powers with regard to churches, priests, church law and customs. Subsequently, the power of the Church grew at the expense of secular aristocrats, and over time ever more church estates came under episcopal control.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "Macedonia for the Macedonians",
    "text": "Macedonia for the Macedonians (Bulgarian: Македония за македонците, romanized: Makedoniya za makedontsite; Greek: Μακεδονία για τους Μακεδόνες, romanized: Makedonía gia tous Makedónes; Macedonian: Македонија на Македонците, romanized: Makedonija na Makedoncite; Serbian: Македонија за Македонце, romanized: Makedonija za Makedonce) is a slogan and political or national concept used during the first half of the 20th century in the region of Macedonia. As political, it aimed to encompass all the nationalities in the area, into a separate supranational entity.\n\nHistory\nWilliam Gladstone and contemporaries\nThe slogan was raised by the British politician William Ewart Gladstone in 1897, in an often misquoted citation, when he promoted the idea on some kind of mini-Balkan Federation in this region. Namely, in a letter Gladstone sent to the Byron Society, disccusing the Macedonian question he stated: Next to the Ottoman Government nothing can be more deplorable and blameworthy than jealousies between Greek and Slav, and plans by the States already existing for appropriating other territory. Why not Macedonia for Macedonians as well as Bulgaria for Bulgarians and Servia for Servians. He also forecasted that, if Macedonians do not stand together in the face of the territorial aspirations, they would certainly be devoured by the existing states. Gladstone appealed for the right of self-determination of the peoples who resided in the region, while Britain proceeded in the following period contemplating the creation of an autonomous Macedonia with a Christian governor as a possible solution of the Macedonian question. On that occasion, the British journalist G. W. Steevens also noted in the preface of the brochure containing the letter of Gladstone, that he has used \"Macedonians\" as a collective name of the diverse population of the region. Steevens explained that there were at least six different kind of Macedonians at that time. Once Gladstone launched the motto, this maxim became widely known. In 1898, the historian William Miller, who visited Macedonia during that period, stressed that it was overrun by rivaling national propagandas, especially Bulgarian, Serb, and Greek who saw Macedonia as their promised land. About Gladstone's proclamation and his motto, Miller approved the creation of an autonomous or independent state of Macedonia, but he stated that this idea is not practical because there was no Macedonian nation and the whole difficulty in this country is that it is a mixture of different warring nationalities. By that reason per Allen Upward that phrase could not have been used by anybody, who had a first hand knowledge of that country. In fact a few accepted then the idea that there might be a separate Macedonian nation.\n\nModern authors\nBy the term \"Macedonians\", different modern authors also believe Gladstone had in mind the various ethnic groups residing in Macedonia, such as Bulgarians, Greeks, Jews, Turks, Aromanians and Albanians; not an imagined \"Macedonian\" ethnic group. Historian Marin V. Pundeff summarizes that \"Macedonia, in Gladstone's phrase, was for the Macedonians, that is, not only for the Bulgarian element... but for all the other ethnic elements residing in it as well\". According to historian Benjamin Lieberman, these included as well those who saw themselves as a separate Macedonian nationality. Per anthropologist Anastasia Karakasidou, national activists in Bulgaria used the phrase to call for the creation of an autonomous Macedonia, although as an intermediate phase towards Greater Bulgaria.\nOther modern authors interpret Gladstone's statement as acknowledging the Macedonians as a separate nationality, According to anthropologist Keith Brown, essentially Gladstone gave one answer himself, the Greek, Bulgarian, Serbian irredentist ambitions prevented Macedonia for Macedonians from existence and usurped any aspirations that the population may had.\n\nOrganizations\nThe motto was adopted by the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (IMARO) and by the Macedo-Romanian Cultural Society (MRCS), in the early 20th century. At that time, according to Vasil Kanchov the local Bulgarians and Aromanians called themselves Macedonians, and the surrounding nations called them so.\n\nInternal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization\nUnder the \"Macedonia for the Macedonians\" slogan IMARO expressed resentment felt against the irredentist aspirations over Macedonia as much as toward the Ottoman rule, and anticipated that it would restrain the region's partition by the warring Balkan states. Thus, in order to enforce the idea of autonomy, IMARO changed its exclusively Bulgarian character, and opened it to all Macedonians and Thracians regardless of nationality, who wished to participate in the anti-Ottoman movement.\nIn an article published in June 1902, the IMARO revolutionaries promoted the idea of autonomy and the slogans \"Macedonia for the Macedonians\". The Organization gave a guarantee for the preservation of all national communities there, and insisted that the Bulgarians could be proud of their tolerance, in opposition to Romanians, Serbs and Greeks. They also planned that the administration of the future autonomous Macedonia will rely on the Bulgarian majority. Those revolutionaries saw the future autonomous Macedonia as a multinational polity, and \"Macedonian\" was an umbrella term covering Greeks, Bulgarians, Turks, Aromanians and Megleno-Romanians, Albanians, Serbs, etc. However, there was no clear concept about the ultimate outcome of the autonomy, some of the members, especially those with leftist inclination, saw it as independent Macedonia, while others saw it as step for the incorporation of Macedonia into the Bulgarian state. The British Consul in Skopje Raphael Fontana wrote on the occasion of the Ilinden Uprising in 1903 that the revolutionaries were working for a general Bulgarian uprising in order to reach their goal of \"Macedonia for the Macedonians\", understood to mean \"Macedonia for the Bulgarians\". \nIn 1902, Boris Sarafov tried to gain Serbian support for a \"Macedonia for Macedonians\", arguing that it was the only way to oppose Bulgarian annexationism. However one year later he changed his position, seeking a military intervention from Bulgaria in order to aid the Ilinden Uprising.\nIn 1905 the Serres group of Yane Sandanski accused the Supreme Macedonian-Adrianople Committee activists that under the motto “Macedonia for the Macedonians” they put a disguised motto “Macedonia for Bulgaria”. The idea of autonomous Macedonia was understood by the Organization as an independent state, which will enter as a separate member into the Balkan Federation.\n\nDuring the 1920s the descendant of the IMARO - IMRO followed also the idea about an independent united Macedonian multiethnic state with prevailing Bulgarian element, something as \"Switzerland on the Balkans\" and kept the slogan Macedonia for the Macedonians until it became defunct in 1934. Another descendant of IMARO was IMRO (United), which during the 1930s sought for an independent Macedonian state with a separate Macedonian nation.\n\nMacedo-Romanian Cultural Society\nThe Macedo-Romanian Cultural Society had as its members the acting Prime and Foreign Ministers, as well as the Head of the Romanian Orthodox Church, and the elite of the Romanian political class. In 1912 an Aromanian memoir was published in Bucharest, after the outbreak of the Balkan War. The memoir was signed by five prominent Romanian and Aromanian public figures, members of the society. In it, the Macedo-Romanian Cultural Society, using the slogan Macedonia for the Macedonians, stated that Macedonia's autonomy is the best solution of the Macedonian question. As the region was ethnically diverse, an autonomous, neutral, cantonized by Swiss model state was proposed, where all nationalities will preserve their mother tongues and religions, enjoying the same democratic political rights. In 1917, during the First World War, the memoir was translated into Esperanto and was published in Stockholm. The memoir was presented to the Peace Conference in Paris in 1919.\n\nMacedonian Federative Organization\nIn 1921 the members of the left-wing of the former IMARO created the Macedonian Federative Organization (MFO), under the Macedonia for the Macedonians motto. The goal of MFO was the creation of an independent Macedonia with intention of joining a future Balkan Federation. Also, the state would have full and equal participation in its governance of all its nationalities. Further they recommended dropping the diverse ethnic designations in Macedonia and uniting all national elements in a distinct entity Macedonians. In 1924, MFO alongside the IMRO, the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Comintern created the May Manifesto.\n\nMacedonian Patriotic Organization\nThe Balkan Wars (1912–1913) and World War I (1914–1918) left the area divided mainly between Greece and Serbia (later Yugoslavia), which resulted in significant changes in its ethnic composition. The Bulgarian community was reduced, either by population exchanges or by forcible change of communities' ethnic identity. In this way the motto began to lose its authenthic character. Macedonian immigrants in the United States and Canada founded in 1922 in Fort Wayne, Indiana, the Macedonian Patriotic Organization. The founders of the MPO in their aspirations for a free and independent Macedonia also accepted the slogan \"Macedonia for the Macedonians\". The use of \"Macedonians\" and \"Macedonian emigrants\" then equally applied to all ethnic groups in Macedonia - Bulgarians, Wallachians, Turks, Albanians, Greeks and others.\n\nSee also\nSvoboda ili smart\nIndependent Macedonia\nAutonomy for Macedonia\nMacedonian Question\nMacedonian nationalism\nUllah millet\nPrincipality of Pindus\n\n\n== Notes ==",

    "text": "Sam Hamad (born June 17, 1958) is a Canadian politician. He is the former member of National Assembly (MNA) for the riding of Louis-Hebert in the Quebec City region. A member of the Quebec Liberal Party, he has held various cabinet posts during his 14 years in the National Assembly. He was the Minister of Natural Resources, Minister for Transports and he was also the Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity, Minister of Labour and Minister responsible for the Capitale-Nationale region.\n\nBiography\nEarly years and education\nBorn in Damascus, Syria, Hamad moved to Quebec City and studied civil engineering at Université Laval where he received both a bachelor's and master's degree. He also studied at the Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières where he obtained a master's degree in management. His birth name was Samer Hamed-Allah but he changed it when he moved to Quebec, saying that Samer sounded too much like the French words \"sa mère\" (meaning \"his mother\").\n\nCareer\nHe was an administration member for the Ordre des Ingénieurs du Québec for nine years, while he was also a lecturer at Université Laval and the Université du Québec à Rimouski and the President of the Quebec Board of Trade and Industry.\nHe was also involved in the community, being the vice-president of Centraide-Quebec a board member of the Laval Hospital Foundation. He was also part of several associations promoting development in the region including the GATIQ which promoted advance technologies and innovations for the region.\nBefore making his foray into politics, Hamad was Vice-President of Groupe Roche, an influential engineering firm, from 1998 to 2003.\n\nPolitics\nHamed entered politics in 2003, where he became the MNA for Louis-Hebert as the Liberals led by Jean Charest defeated the Parti Québécois. He would be named Minister of Wildlife, Natural Resources and Parks and the Minister responsible for the Capitale-Nationale (Quebec) region. He was removed from Cabinet in 2005 after he was criticized in regard to a project which would have added a new thermo plant in the Suroit region.\nHamad was narrowly re-elected in 2007. Initially, it was thought that the Action démocratique du Québec won the seat but late ballots pushed Hamad to a late-victory and no recounts were made. As he was only one of two Liberal MNAs elected in the Quebec City region (the other being Philippe Couillard), Hamad was named the Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity until where he was named Minister of Transports, swapping portfolios with Julie Boulet. Briefly in 2010, he also held the Labour portfolio after David Whissell resigned his position following conflict of interest allegations.\nHe returned to the Labour portfolio on April 23, 2014.\nHe announced his resignation as an MNA on April 27, 2017.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\"Biography\".

    "title": "Megacerops",
    "text": "Megacerops (\"large-horned face\") is an extinct genus of brontothere, an extinct group of rhinoceros-like browsers traditionally classified as relatives of horses. Megacerops was endemic to North America during the Late Eocene, during the Chadronian land mammal age.\nChadronian brontotheres are well represented in the fossil record, known from several skeletons and hundreds of complete skulls. Because the fossils vary considerably in the size and shape of the horns, close to fifty species of Chadronian brontotheres have been named historically. Poor stratigraphic data for the majority of the fossils has further complicated the taxonomy. Today, variations among the fossils are considered to be the result of sexual dimorphism and other individual variation. Only one Chadronian brontothere species is confidently considered to be valid, M. coloradensis. Rare fossils with bifurcating horns may represent a second species, M. kuwagatarhinus. Several historical generic names now considered synonyms of Megacerops remain common in popular culture, such as Brontotherium, Brontops, and Titanotherium.\nAlthough similar to modern rhinoceros, Megacerops was closer to elephants in size. The largest known Megacerops may have been over 2.5 meters (8.2 feet) tall at the shoulder and could have weighed up to five tonnes. They were the largest animals in their environment and likely too large to be preyed upon by any contemporary predator. The horns of Megacerops, its signature feature, were anatomically similar to the ossicones of modern giraffes and are believed to have been used in intraspecific combat. Paleoclimatological models of the Eocene, and isotope analyses of Megacerops teeth, suggest that they lived in warm temperate to subtropical forests and woodlands, and preferred moist environments.\n\nHistory of research\nEarly discoveries\nFossils of Megacerops were among the first mammal fossils from the American West to be brought to scientific attention. Long before the time of scientific inquiry into the fossils, Megacerops remains were sometimes exposed by severe rainstorms and found by Native Americans of the Lakota Sioux and Pawnee peoples. The Lakota referred to these great mammals as wakíŋyaŋ, translated as \"thunder beasts\".\n\nThe first brontothere fossil to be scientifically described was a fragment of a right jaw (USNM 21820), found in Chadronian deposits in the White River badlands of South Dakota. The jaw fragment was described by Hiram A. Prout in 1846 and 1847. Although Prout correctly identified the fossil as belonging to a large perissodactyl, he believed that the jaw came from a \"giant Palaeotherium\" (an equoid). In 1849, Auguste Pomel realized that the fossil did not belong to Palaeotherium and instead designated it as the type specimen of a new genus and species, Menodus giganteus. In 1850, Richard Owen and colleagues recorded further brontothere teeth and jaws. Owen and colleagues believed these fossils represented the same species as Prout's jaw but noted that it was difficult to establish diagnostic features on the genus level. Apparently ignoring Pomel's name, Owen and colleagues named the new species Palaeotherium? proutii.Owen's fossils were soon acquired by Joseph Leidy, who examined and described the material in greater detail through 1852 and 1853. Already before any in-depth study, Leidy suspected that the fossils did not belong to any known equoid, such as Palaeotherium or Anchitherium, and noted that \"should the suspicion prove correct, Titanotherium would be a good name for this animal, as expressive of its very great size\". After more extensive examination, Leidy placed P.? proutii in the new genus Titanotherium and designated a left jaw from Owen's material (USNM 113) as the type specimen. Although recognized as large perissodactyls, early descriptions of brontothere fossils up to and including Leidy's work failed to recognize their distinctive nature.\nThe first known brontothere fossil to preserve most of the animal's distinctive horns was described by Leidy in 1870 as the type specimen of the new genus and species Megacerops coloradensis. Leidy obtained the fragmentary fossil from \"Dr. Gehrung of Colorado City\" and, lacking comparative brontothere material, incorrectly believed it to have belonged to a relative of the extinct giraffid Sivatherium.\nIn the 1870s and 1880s, the northern Great Plains were one of the main regions to be extensively excavated in the Bone Wars, a period of intense competitive fossil hunting between the rival researchers Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope. Both Marsh and Cope funded expeditions to uncover and describe new prehistoric mammals in the region. In the 1870s, Marsh and Cope described several dinoceratans, an extinct group of large mammals, some of which had horns similar to Megacerops, such as Uintatherium and Eobasileus. In 1873, Leidy speculated that his Megacerops may belong to the same order as these animals, and not the ruminants. Leidy further noted similarities between the Megacerops specimen and fragmentary fossil horn cores he had previously speculated to perhaps belong to Titanotherium.\n\nFurther discoveries\nOthniel Charles Marsh is considered the most important figure in the early research on the brontotheres. His studies of brontotheres began in 1870, when Marsh led an expedition to northern Colorado on behalf of Yale College. During the expedition, Marsh's crew were shown a brontothere jaw by a group of Lakota, who told them of their legends of wakíŋyaŋ. The expedition collected a large number of brontothere fossils, including jaws, skulls, and postcranial elements. In honor of Lakota legends, Marsh named the new genus Brontotherium (\"thunder beast\") in 1873. Marsh's 1873 description of Brontotherium gigas was the most important contribution to brontothere knowledge up until his time. The holotype was designated as another lower jaw, but Marsh was able to correctly describe several characters of both the jaws and the rest of the skeleton. Marsh recognized Brontotherium as a \"true perissodactyl with limb bones resembling those of Rhinoceros\". Marsh recognized that Brontotherium was related to the animal described as Titanotherium by Leidy, and erected the new family Brontotheriidae to contain the two genera. In 1875, H. C. Clifford discovered and excavated a large and relatively complete brontothere skeleton near Chadron, Nebraska. This skeleton (YPM VP 12048) was described by Marsh in 1887 as the type specimen of the new genus and species Brontops robustus.\nMarsh continued to study brontothere fossils for the reminder of his career, some collected by himself but most purchased from collectors \"out West\". New specimens were also uncovered and studied by Leidy and Cope. Marsh, Leidy, and Cope named new species for close to every Chadronian brontothere specimen that came into their possession. In cooperation with the United States Geological Survey, Marsh wrote a series of monographs on prehistoric animals from the modern United States. Paleontological field work was carried out at an unprecedented scale by the US Geological Survey to gather material for Marsh's monographs on ceratopsian dinosaurs and brontotheres. The brontothere collection assembled for Marsh's monograph eventually included several nearly complete skeletons and nearly two hundred complete skulls. Marsh's brontothere monograph was not completed before his death in 1899, and he left no known manuscript for it, only pencil notes and unpublished figures.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, most of the museums in the United States funded fossil collecting in the so-called \"Titanotherium beds\" of the Great Plains, increasing the already large brontothere fossil sample to encompass further skeletons and hundreds of skulls. In 1929, Henry Fairfield Osborn published a monograph on the brontotheres, The Titanotheres of Ancient Wyoming, Dakota and Nebraska. Osborn had made study of brontotheres one of his life's quests and believed his work, spanning 951 pages and two volumes, and illustrated with 795 figures and 236 plates, would be the definitive work on the animals.\nThe large number of fossils collected has made Megacerops one of the best represented large herbivores in the fossil record of North American mammals. Megacerops fossils have predominantly been recovered from the White River Group in the United States and the Cypress Hills Formation in Canada. All fossils now attributed to Megacerops appear to be confined to the Chadronian land mammal age, which corresponds to the Late Eocene. Most Megacerops specimens have poorly recorded stratigraphic data, limiting the degree to which variation in single contemporary populations can be studied. The American Museum of Natural History has a large collection of brontothere specimens with well-recorded stratigraphic data, collected in the 1940s and 1950s. The specimens of this collection are largely unprepared and still encased in the plaster field jackets they were originally put in, and interest and funding to examine them has been limited.\n\nTaxonomy and species\n20th-century developments\nBy the time of Osborn's monograph, at least 47 species of Chadronian brontotheres had been named, many based on poor and fragmentary fossils. There was a general consensus throughout the 20th century that the brontotheres were highly oversplit, divided into far too many species. Taxonomic problems were compounded by confusion around the type specimens and names of several of the species. Marsh incorrectly argued in 1873 that Menodus was preoccupied by the reptile Menodon (=Nothosaurus). In several publications, both Leidy and Osborn sometimes confused USNM 113 (type specimen of Titanotherium) with USNM 21820 (type specimen of Menodus). Osborn incorrectly believed that USNM 21820 had been destroyed in the St. Louis Fire of 1849 and proposed designating a brontothere skull in the American Museum of Natural History, AMNH 505, as a neotype specimen.\nChadronian brontotheres are very similar in most features of the skeleton. Clear differences between specimens are for the most part seen only in the shape, orientation, and size of horns, nasal bones, and zygomatic arches. Before his 1929 monograph, Osborn considered the possibility that all Chadronian brontotheres belonged to a single genus, for which he preferred the name Titanotherium. In the mongraph, Osborn nevertheless recognized 37 of the up until then named species as valid. Almost every well-preserved skull was designated as a separate species. Osborn attributed the variation seen in the fossil material to both individual variation due to sex and age, and to species-level differences, but did not demonstrate how a differing feature could be determined to be due to one factor or another.\nOsborn's conclusions faced criticism by other paleontologists. In 1941, William Berryman Scott stated that \"it is hardly worthwhile even to list the species; that 37 species could not have co-existed within the relatively brief space of the Chadron, is obvious; how many did exist and what names should be given to them, are insoluable problems\". Scott further stated that \"the probably great effects of sex and age and fluctuating variability have not been sufficiently evaluated\". Despite criticism, further revisions of brontothere material were not attempted for most of the 20th century due to the daunting size of Osborn's monograph and the sheer number of fossil specimens known, many of which were yet to be sufficiently prepared.\nIn 1967, John Clark, James R. Beerbower, and Kennetk K. Kietzke were the first to suggest that all Chadronian brontotheres belonged to a single species that exhibited great individual variation. This suggestion was based on the discovery of four horn cores with variable morphology, found at a single site within 30 feet of each other, in a layer only one foot thick. Finding it unlikely that these associated fossils were from four separate species, Clark, Beerbower, and Kietzke referred all four to Menodus giganteus, the oldest available Chadronian brontothere name, and designated all other generic names, such as Brontotherium and Titanotherium, as junior synonyms. The only other Chadronian brontothere genus recognized as valid by Clark, Beerbower, and Kietzke was Teleodus. Teleodus has since been recognized as invalid, with its type specimen revealed to have been a 19th-century hoax in 2004.\nIn 1989, Bryn J. Mader published the first true revision of the Brontotheriidae since Osborn. Mader recognized a number of Chadronian brontothere species as valid, divided into the three genera Menops, Brontops, and Megacerops. Mader's classification scheme was to a large extent based on the cross-section shapes of horns. By this approach, the name Menodus giganteus is a nomen dubium, since the holotype fossil of that species contains no horn material and thus no diagnostic features. Mader undertook no species-level revision of the three genera, and did not demonstrate them to be monophyletic via phylogenetic analysis.\n\nRecognition of only two species\nIn a 2004 preliminary revision, Matthew C. Mihlbachler, Spencer G. Lucas, and Robert J. Emry concluded that while the variation among Chadronian brontotheres was greater than what is generally accepted within a single species, the variability resembles that of modern sexually dimorphic mammal species. Mihlbachler, Lucas, and Emry noted that if only a single Chadronian brontothere species is recognized, the name Menodus giganteus should be used as the oldest available name. The problem was complicated by rare Chadronian brontothere skulls with bifurcating horns, a trait not seen in the vast majority of specimens. These fossils had been described as a new species by Mader and John P. Alexander in 1995, Megacerops kuwagatarhinus. Mihlbachler, Lucas, and Emry considered it impossible to determine if M. kuwagatarhinus was an isolated breeding population (i.e. separate species) from the more common form with unbifurcating horns, or just very atypical individuals. The holotype skull of M. kuwagatarhinus (F:AM 128600) preserves a molar that exhibits some differences to typical brontothere molars, perhaps suggesting species-level distinction, but known M. kuwagatarhinus fossils do not otherwise preserve any teeth. Since clear distinctions between the two forms can only be seen in the horns, Mihlbachler, Lucas, and Emry suggested that the name Megacerops coloradensis should be used for the common species with unbifurcating horns. The M. coloradensis holotype (ANSP 13362) is the earliest described brontothere holotype to preserve unbifurcating horns, and thus to securely belong to this species. Due to the poor state of brontothere fossil stratigraphic data, Mihlbachler, Lucas, and Emry noted that they could not rule out the possibility of Megacerops undergoing anagenic evolution over the course of the Chadronian, nor the possibility that two or more anagenically evolving species that were distinct at any given moment would not be distinguishable in the available temporally averaged fossil assemblage.\nFurther studies by Mihlbachler in 2004 and 2008 further supported that only two Chadronian brontothere species, M. coloradensis and M. kuwagatarhinus were diagnosable, with all other species either being synonyms of those two species or nomina dubia. In a comprehensive 2008 phylogenetic analysis, Mihlbachler recovered Megacerops as a monophyletic genus, and noted that the present data supported only two species but that more could perhaps be indicated in future studies on the Megacerops material. Although a number of genera were synonymized with Megacerops, Mihlbachler did not perform a detailed revision of the genus, which he considered outside the scope of the 2008 study. A detailed revision of Megacerops remains an area in need of future research. In 2021, Mihlbachler and Donald Prothero noted that \"the evolution and paleobiology of Megacerops and closely allied species are potentially rich areas of investigation, although ambiguity regarding the basic systematics of this group is an obstacle to further research\".\nSince 2008, the status of Megacerops as the only valid Chadronian brontothere genus, containing only two species, has become widely accepted. Mihlbachler's conclusions have been supported by researchers such as Donald Prothero, Karen J. Lloyd, Jaelyn J. Eberle, Parker D. Rhinehart, Alfred J. Mead, and Dennis Parmley. Bryn J. Mader rejected Mihlbachler's work, and continued to regard Menops, Brontops, and Megacerops to be distinct genera, with several species. Although historical generic names such as Titanotherium, Brontotherium, and Brontops are generally not treated seriously by researchers today, these names continue to remain famous and appear in popular books, on websites, and as names for toys.\nIn 2021, Rory E. Sweedler, Eberle, and Mihlbachler described a new brontothere jaw (UCM 109045) from a Chadronian locality in the Antero Formation in Colorado. UCM 109045 has a lower number of incisors than the jaws of M. coloradensis, and has a longer postcanine diastema (longer gap between the canines and the other teeth). The jaw was determined to probably belong to a species distinct from M. coloradensis, and was noted to be morphologically similar to jaws of the earlier brontothere Protitanops, and to fossils described as Megacerops primitivus by Lawrence Lambe in 1908, designated as a nomen dubium in Mihlbachler's previous work. Sweedler, Eberle, and Mihlbachler concluded that it was possible that UCM 109045 belonged to the same species as the fossils referred to M. kuwagatarhinus, though little comparison was possible. In this case, the appropriate name for the second Chadronian brontothere species might be M. primitivus, with M. kuwagatarhinus being a junior synonym of that species.\n\nDescription\nSize\nAlthough superficially similar to modern rhinoceros in appearance, an example of convergent evolution, Megacerops exceeded all living rhinoceros in size. Megacerops was closer in size to modern elephants, only shorter. They were among the largest brontotheres, rivaled in size only by a handful of other genera, such as Gnathotitan and Embolotherium.\nThe largest Megacerops are typically estimated to have been 2,5 meters (8,2 feet) tall at the shoulder. This measurement derives in part from YPM VP 12048, the well-preserved skeleton once considered the type specimen of Brontops robustus. When first mounted in 1916, this specimen was measured at 2,502 meters (8 feet 2½ inches) tall at the shoulder and 4,635 meters (15 feet 2½ inches) long, including the tail. The largest Megacerops specimens have sometimes historically been estimated to have reached 3 meters (10 feet) tall at the shoulder. Large Megacerops would have reached about 5 meters in length (16 feet).\nVarious weight estimates of Megacerops have been published, ranging from as low as 2–3 tonnes (2.2–3.3 short tons) to as high as 5 tonnes (5.5 short tons).\n\nSkull\nMegacerops had a massive skull which somewhat resembled that of modern rhinoceros. The skull was long, broad, and saddle-shaped.\n\nHorns\nMany brontothere genera had horns or cranial domes. Megacerops had the most developed horns out of all of the North American brontotheres, consisting of two bony protuberances above the nose, vaguely reminiscent of a slingshot in shape. In Megacerops, the horns had evolved to become the dominant and central feature of the skull. The shape, size, and orientation of Megacerops horns varied greatly between individuals, as did the degree to which the horns impacted the rest of the skull anatomy. Smaller Megacerops with smaller horns had a typical and well developed nasal process. In larger Megacerops with larger horns, the nasal process was largely absorbed by the horns and reduced to a small triangle-shaped remnant structure. It is possible that the system controlling horn growth as Megacerops matured was relatively indeterminate, with minor genetic differences or \"accidents of developments\" giving rise to great variations in shape. Based on sexual dimorphism in modern horned mammals, larger Megacerops with larger horns are assumed to have been males.\nThe horns were composed of non-deciduous bone and not elaborated with any additional structures. There were large air cavities in the base of the horns. Among modern mammals, the anatomical structure that most closely resembles brontothere horns are the ossicones of giraffes.\n\nThe life appearance of the horns is unknown. They have been described as analogous to the horns of deer and bovines and historical reconstructions have often depicted them as sheathed in keratinous horns. It is unlikely that the horns were sheathed in such a way in life, since they lack the vascular impressions seen in horn cores of animals such as cows and ceratopsian dinosaurs. Like giraffe ossicones, brontothere horns were most likely instead entirely covered in skin. This skin may have been keratinized, but there is no evidence for this. The distal (furthest point from the body) ends of the horns often have a roughened surface. In many skulls, this roughened surface also extends down to around the nose and the eye orbits. The roughened surface is similar to the roughened patches beneath horns on rhinoceros skulls. In 1905, Richard Swann Lull speculated that the roughened surfaces on brontothere horns could have supported two to four (one to two per horn) additional, smaller horns of keratin anatomically similar to rhinoceros horns.\nBrontothere horns are believed to have been used for intraspecific combat. The shape of the horns suggest that rivals could have locked horns with each other and thus protected vulnerable areas, such as their sides. The horns were probably most well suited to wrestling in this fashion. The strong neck musculature of Megacerops also means that brontotheres would have been capable of toppling each other with upward thrusts, and headbutting. The sides of Megacerops was probably the main focus of attack. One fossil (AMNH 518) preserves a rib broken and healed during the life of the animal. It is unlikely that any other animal than another Megacerops could have inflicted such an injury. Some brontothere horns show evidence of secondary bone growth, perhaps regrowth due to clashes with other brontotheres.\n\nDentition\nThe dentition of Megacerops, as currently recognized, is more variable than is normal within a single species. There is no consistent dental formula for the entire fossil assemblage, which has historically been interpreted as a genus-level differentiating trait. In 1876, Marsh described the dental formula of \"Brontotherium\" as 2.1.4.32.1.3.3, that of \"Menodus\" as 2.1.4.32.1.4?.3, that of Megacerops as 2.1.4.30.1.3.3, and that of \"Diconodon\" as 0.1.4.31.1.3.3. In 1889, Marsh's \"Brontops\" was described as distinct based on its dental formula, 2.1.4.31.1.4.3. Although these differences may lend credence to the idea that there were multiple different species of Chadronian brontotheres, as interpreted historically, it is not possible to separate the fossils into discrete groups based on dentition, just as with other traits.\nMegacerops had at most two pairs of incisors. More basal brontotheres, such as Diplacodon and Protitanotherium had additional pairs of incisors, but experienced atrophy of some pairs and hypertrophy of others, perhaps a step towards the condition seen in Megacerops. The fossil evidence points to the incisors being of little use to Megacerops; they were reduced in size, fossils show very little wear, and presumed old Megacerops specimens sometimes lost their incisors over the course of their lives. The lack of use for the incisors could suggest that brontotheres had a prehensile upper lip, similar to modern rhinoceros.\n\nPostcranial skeleton\nThe postcranial skeleton of Megacerops was massive, robust, and relatively short. The most notable feature of the postcranial skeleton is the elongated spines of the dorsal vertebrae above the shoulders, an adaptation to support the huge neck muscles needed to carry the heavy skull. This aspect of Megacerops anatomy has been compared to the vertebrae and neck musculature of modern bison. The neck itself was stout and moderately long. The vertebrae of Megacerops were somewhat similar to those of modern rhinoceros. The ribs were strong and massive. The pelvis of Megacerops was expanded transversely and wide, similar to elephant pelvises.\nThe limbs of Megacerops were intermediate in proportion between those of modern rhinoceros and elephants. The limbs of show several adaptations to withstand the great weight of the animal. Compared to rhinoceros, Megacerops limbs are stouter, particularly at the ankles and wrists, and there is a lesser degree of angulations between the segments of the limbs. The forelimbs were especially robust and several adaptations, notably roughenings of the olecranon (the protruding part of the elbow) and the humerus, suggest great muscle power.\nMegacerops had four toes on its front feet and three toes on its rear feet. The arrangment of their feet bones indicate that Megacerops feet had a pad of elastic tissue, similar to the feet of modern elephants and rhinoceros.\n\nClassification\nBrontotheres composed the family Brontotheriidae, of which Megacerops was a derived member. The Brontheriidae belonged to the order Perissodactyla (odd-toed ungulates), the group that includes modern horses, rhinoceros, and tapirs. The position of the brontotheres in the perissodactyl family tree is contentious and results vary between studies. The brontotheres have traditionally been placed in the perissodactyl suborder Hippomorpha, a group that also includes horses, the extinct palaeotheres (Palaeotheriidae), and in some classification schemes the extinct chalicotheres (Chalicotheriidae). Brontotheres have alternatively been classified as inside Palaeotheriidae, in the different suborder Ceratomorpha as a sister group of rhinoceros and tapirs, outside the clade that contains chalicotheres, horses, rhinoceros, and tapirs, and as more closely related to chalicotheres, rhinoceros, and tapirs than to horses.\nThe family Brontotheriidae was created by Marsh in 1873 to contain the horned brontotheres known at the time, Titanotherium and Brontotherium (both genera now considered synonyms of Megacerops). Serious attempts to classify the large number of American brontothere fossils were undertaken by Osborn in the early 20th century. In his 1929 monograph, Osborn divided the Brontotheriidae into a number of different subfamilies, which he believed represented several polyphyletic and separately evolving lineages. Osborn's taxonomy was flawed because of his division of the material into a vast number of species. Osborn's taxonomy also reflected his personal views on evolution, the obsolete hypothesis of orthogenesis, and is largely incompatible with the modern understanding of evolutionary theory. Despite these shortcomings, the taxonomy was mostly retained throughout the 20th century, though the subfamilies used could vary between studies. Detailed revisions to brontothere taxonomy were not published until work by Mader in the 1980s and 1990s, and Mihlbachler in the 2000s.\nPer Mihlbachler's 2008 revision, Megacerops is classified as part of the infratribe Brontotheriita, alongside the genera Dianotitan, Duchesneodus, Eubrontotherium, Notiotitanops, Parabrontops, and Protitanops. The Brontotheriita were a sister group to the infratribe Embolotheriita, which includes genera such as Embolotherium, Metatitan, and Gnathotitan.\nThe cladograms below are the strict reduced consensus tree of brontotheres from Mihlbachler's 2008 analysis (collapsed to show only the Brontotheriita), and the strict consensus tree for the Brontotheriita from a 2021 study by Mihlbachler and Prothero on brontheres from Texas.\n\nPaleoecology\nMegacerops lived in a warm temperate to subtropical environment, in forests and open woodlands. Oxygen isotope analysis of Megacerops tooth enamel from the White River assemblage has found them to have low δ18O values, which likely reflects the preference of the genus for moist environments. Megacerops was the largest animal in its environment. They have been interpreted as obligatory browsers because of their low-crowned teeth, which would have been used to shear or crush plants. Their teeth indicate that brontotheres were folivores and/or frugivores, though their large size suggest that they must have been relatively non-selective when it came to food. Their diet was likely similar to modern-day moose and black rhinoceros. Like large animals of today, Megacerops would have played an important ecological role in shaping the environment that they inhabited.\nA variety of predators coexisted with Megacerops, including several false saber-toothed cats, canids, and creodonts. It is unlikely that any contemporary predator would have been able to hunt Megacerops on account of their size. Even juvenile Megacerops were large compared to contemporary predators and would have been difficult to prey on.\nM. coloradensis fossils have been found in mass death assemblages, suggesting that they were social animals who may have traveled in herds.\n\nExtinction\nThe brontotheres went extinct at the end of the Eocene. Megacerops was the last brontothere in North America, and the last living member of the Brontotheriita. Judging by the size of Megacerops and its relatives, and the development of its horns, the brontotheres apparently died out when at the peak of their evolutionary development. Various explanations have been proposed for their sudden disappearance. Osborn believed that the brontotheres succumbed to overadaptation and \"racial senescence\". Another unsubstantiated hypothesis is that the brontotheres died out due to a trypanosomiasis epidemic, caused by ancestors of the modern tsetse fly.\nDonald Prothero has attributed brontothere extinction to the Eocene–Oligocene extinction event, when a period of glaciation coincided with extinctions in several different mammal groups. The temperature changes at the boundary between the Eocene and Oligocene dramatically impacted vegetation, leading to a large-scale replacement of Eocene forests, on which brontotheres depended, with savanna environments. The ecological niche of the brontotheres was later taken over by rhinoceros and elephants.\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nFast evolution of Megacerops after the end-Cretaceous mass extinction, 12 May 2023, Live Science",

    "title": "Emotional blackmail",
    "text": "The term emotional blackmail was popularized by clinical social worker Susan Forward about controlling people in relationships and the theory that fear, obligation and guilt (FOG) are the transactional dynamics at play between the controller and the person being controlled. Understanding these dynamics is useful to anyone trying to extricate themself from the controlling behavior of another person and deal with their own compulsions to do things that are uncomfortable, undesirable, burdensome, or self-sacrificing for others.\n\nGeneral\nThe first documented use of \"emotional blackmail\" appeared in 1947 in the Journal of the National Association of Deans of Women in the article \"Discipline and Group Psychology\". The term was used to describe one type of problematic classroom control model often used by teachers. Esther Vilar, an Argentine physician and anti-feminist writer, also used the term \"emotional blackmail\" in the early 1970s to describe a parenting strategy observed among some mothers with multiple children.\nEmotional blackmail typically involves two people who have established a close personal or intimate relationship (parent and child, spouses, siblings, or two close friends). Children, too, will employ special pleading and emotional blackmail to promote their own interests, and self-development, within the family system.\nEmotional blackmailers use fear, obligation and guilt in their relationships, ensuring that others feel afraid to cross them, obligated to give them their way and swamped by guilt if they resist. Knowing that someone close to them wants love, approval or confirmation of identity and self-esteem, blackmailers may threaten to withhold them (e.g., withhold love) or take them away altogether, making the second person feel they must earn them by agreement. Fear, obligation or guilt is commonly referred to as \"FOG\". FOG is a contrived acronym—a play on the word \"fog\" which describes something that obscures and confuses a situation or someone's thought processes.\nThe person who is acting in a controlling way often wants something from the other person that is legitimate to want. They may want to feel loved, safe, valuable, appreciated, supported, needed, etc. This is not the problem. The problem is often more a matter of how they are going about getting what they want, or that they are insensitive to others' needs in doing so, and how others react to all of this.\nUnder pressure, one may become a sort of hostage, forced to act under pressure of the threat of responsibility for the other's breakdown. One could fall into a pattern of letting the blackmailer control his/her decisions and behavior, lost in what Doris Lessing described as \"a sort of psychological fog\".\nEmotional blackmail is a punishment that can take place in romantic relationships. For instance, in an unpleasant divorce, the emotional blackmailer might warn that if their spouse files for divorce, they would retain the financial assets or never allow them to interact with the children. Such actions might make the victim angry as they feel they are being controlled and unable to react in a healthy way.\n\nTypes\nForward and Frazier identify four blackmail types each with their own mental manipulation style:\n\nThere are different levels of demands—demands that are of little consequence, demands that involve important issues or personal integrity, demands that affect major life decisions, and/or demands that are dangerous or illegal.\n\nPatterns and characteristics\nAddictions\nAddicts often believe that being in control is how to achieve success and happiness in life. People who follow this rule use it as a survival skill, having usually learned it in childhood. As long as they make the rules, no one can back them into a corner with their feelings.\n\nPersonality disorders\nPeople with certain mental conditions are predisposed to controlling behavior including those with paranoid personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, and narcissistic personality disorder.\nPeople with borderline personality disorder are particularly likely to use emotional blackmail (as too are destructive narcissists). However, their actions may be impulsive and driven by fear and a desperate sense of hopelessness, rather than being the product of any conscious plan.\n\nCodependency\nCodependency often involves placing a lower priority on one's own needs, while being excessively preoccupied with the needs of others. Codependency can occur in any type of relationship, including family, work, friendship, and also romantic, peer or community relationships.\n\nAffluenza and children\nAffluenza—the status insecurity derived from obsessively keeping up with the Joneses—has been linked by Oliver James to a pattern of childhood training whereby sufferers were \"subjected to a form of emotional blackmail as toddlers. Their mothers' love becomes conditional on exhibiting behaviour that achieved parental goals.\"\n\nAssertiveness training\nAssertiveness training encourages people to not engage in fruitless back-and-forths or power struggles with the emotional blackmailer but instead to repeat a neutral statement, such as \"I can see how you feel that way,\" or, if pressured to eat, say \"No thank you, I'm not hungry.\" They are taught to keep their statements within certain boundaries in order not to capitulate to coercive nagging, emotional blackmail, or bullying.\n\nRecovery\nTechniques for resisting emotional blackmail include strengthening personal boundaries, resisting demands, developing a power statement—the determination to stand the pressure—and buying time to break old patterns. Re-connecting with the autonomous parts of the self the blackmailer had over-ruled is not necessarily easy. One may feel guilty based on emotional blackmail, even while recognizing the guilt as induced and irrational; but still be able to resist overcompensating, and ignore the blackmailer's attempt to gain attention by way of having a tantrum.\nConsistently ignoring the manipulation in a friendly way may however lead to its intensification, and threats of separation, or to accusations of being \"crazy\" or a \"home wrecker\".\n\nCultural examples\nAngela Carter described Beauty and the Beast as glorifying emotional blackmail on the part of the Beast, as a means of controlling his target, Beauty.\nNovelist Doris Lessing claimed that \"I became an expert in emotional blackmail by the time I was five.\"\n\nCriticism\nDaniel Miller objects that in popular psychology the idea of emotional blackmail has been misused as a defense against any form of fellow-feeling or consideration for others.\nLabeling of this dynamic with inflammatory terms such as \"blackmail\" and \"manipulation\" may not be so helpful as it is both polarizing and it implies premeditation and malicious intent which is often not the case. Controlling behavior and being controlled is a transaction between two people with both playing a part.\n\nSee also\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "August Eighth (Russian: «Август. Восьмого», translit. Avgust. Vosʹmogo) is a 2012 Russian propaganda war film about the 2008 August War. It was produced and directed by Dzhanik Fayziev.\n\nBackground\nThe film tells the story of a young single mother who must make her way to South Ossetia in order to reunite with her son whom she had sent away before the war. The story of the war is shown through two different point of view. One is the mother's and the other is the son's, who sees it in terms of a science fiction story about fighting robots.\nIn comparison to Olympus Inferno and 5 Days of War, August Eighth was not marketed as a \"search for the truth\" film. However, it was recognized as a socially important project, and was filmed at the expense of the Russian State Fund for Social and Economic Support of National Cinematography.\nTwentieth Century Fox C.I.S., a Russian distributor of 20th Century Fox distributed the film. The Russian premiere took place on 21 February 2012. It premiered on television on 4 November 2012 on Channel One.\n\nPlot\nKseniya, a 23-year-old pastry chef from Moscow, is trying to move on from her failed marriage and focus on her new relationship with Yegor, a young banker. Her seven-year-old son Artyom struggles with his parents’ separation, retreating into a vivid fantasy world where he imagines himself as a superhero called Kosmoboy. In his imagination, Kosmoboy fights alongside a towering robot ally named Edger Beroev against the monstrous villain Mrakovlast (“Darklord”), a symbolic reflection of Artyom’s emotional fears.\nOn August 5, 2008, Kseniya receives a call from her ex-husband Zaur, an Ossetian peacekeeper serving with the Russian Armed Forces in South Ossetia. Zaur asks Kseniya to send Artyom to visit his parents in Sidamonta, a quiet village near the Georgia–South Ossetia border. Zaur assures her that Artyom will be completely safe. At the same time, two Russian Spetsnaz reconnaissance soldiers Seryoza and Lyokha are observing heavy Georgian troops and armor movements near the Dariali Gorge, raising concerns about an imminent conflict.\nAlthough hesitant, Kseniya agrees to send her son to South Ossetia so she can take a short vacation to Sochi with Yegor, who is uninterested in spending time with the boy. Kseniya makes Zaur promise that he will return Artyom to Moscow immediately if she asks.\nTwo days later, on August 7, 2008, Kseniya learns from the news that tensions in South Ossetia have erupted into open fighting. Panicking, she calls Zaur and demands that he have Artyom flown back home. Zaur insists their son is safe and happily staying with his grandparents. Distraught, Kseniya confronts Yegor at his bank, but he refuses to get involved in her “family drama”. Their argument becomes public and humiliating for him, ending their relationship.\nDetermined to rescue her son herself, Kseniya flies to Vladikavkaz, then boards a civilian bus through the Roki Tunnel into South Ossetia. Midway through the mountain pass, the bus is struck by an anti-tank missile launched by unknown attackers, tearing it in half and sending survivors scrambling for their lives. A Russian Army reconnaissance unit led by Lyokha arrives in two GAZ Tigr armored vehicles and rescues Kseniya and the remaining passengers. Lyokha escorts her to Tskhinvali, the capital of South Ossetia, where that night the Battle of Tskhinvali begins as Georgian BM-21 Grad rockets and artilleries devastate the city center. Amid chaos and shelling, Kseniya flees with local civilians under the protection of a South Ossetian militia leader, Kazbek Nikolaevich.\nThey reach the Dzau refugee camp. Along the route, Kseniya manages to call Zaur, who is driving back to Sidamonta to evacuate his parents and Artyom toward the Russian peacekeepers’ base. They agree to meet in Dzau, but before Zaur can leave, a Georgian T-72 tank obliterates the family. Zaur and his parents are killed instantly, while Artyom, injured and traumatized, hides inside the ruins. When Kseniya phones his mobile, the boy mutters in delirium: “Mrakovlast was here… Mrakovlast killed everyone…” Realizing what happened, Kseniya resolves to reach him alone.\nShe joins a Russian military convoy led by Captain Ilya, a friend of Zaur, along with several war correspondents. En route, the convoy is ambushed by Georgian soldiers after a radio malfunction prevents Lyokha’s team from warning them. Most of the Russian troops, including Ilya, are killed. Kseniya narrowly survives when Lyokha’s reconnaissance unit arrives again and pulls her to safety. He brings her to his field base near Sidamonta, the same area where Artyom is hiding.\nThe next day, Lyokha and his men set out in two GAZ Tigrs to evacuate trapped civilians and peacekeepers. They are attacked by a Georgian T-72 tank but escape thanks to Lyokha’s precise timing during the tank’s 6-second reload cycle. With the Russian lines under pressure, Lyokha and his team remains behind to cover evacuations, leaving Kseniya to continue alone.\nStealing a Georgian army's Land Rover Defender, Kseniya drives toward the ruins of Zaur’s house. There she finds Artyom, weak and unable to walk. While attempting to reach Russian positions, they are spotted and fired upon by Georgian troops and an Otokar Cobra armored car, supported by the same T-72. Remembering Lyokha’s instructions about the T-72’s reload interval, Kseniya maneuvers during the 6-second window, causing the Georgian tank’s shell to miss and destroy its own pursuing vehicle instead. As she speeds through a staging area filled with Georgian soldiers and heavy equipments, Russian Air Force Su-25 ground-attack jets launch an ground attack run, annihilating the staging enemies and clearing a path for her escape.\nWhile stopping to give first aid to Artyom, Kseniya is confronted by a lone Georgian soldier. Instead of killing them, he takes pity and drives them toward Russian lines. Finally, Kseniya climbs a hill with Artyom in her arms as Russian T-72 tanks and troops approach. The lead tank halts before them, and its commander asks if she speaks Russian. When she nods, he orders her to move aside, allowing their advance to continue. Kseniya and Artyom keep walking through the smoke-filled battlefield.\nLater, Artyom awakens in a field hospital, recovering from his injuries. Kseniya gently tells him about Zaur’s death. In the closing scene, when they are preparing to board an Mi-17 evacuation helicopter, Lyokha visits them, reporting that Russian forces have captured the Georgian city of Gori, effectively ending the war. Kseniya and Artyom are flown back to Russia, with Lyokha promised to meet them again in the future.\nThe final scene shows the cordless landline phone on the table in Kseniya's house at Moscow ringing, with Yegor calling three times but no one answers and leaving a message, and surprisingly, Lyokha finally calls and the film ends.\n\nCast\nProduction\nThe central plot is based on two true stories: a man dragged his ex-girlfriend from South Ossetia in August 2008; and the second on the producer's friend's son who suffered dissociation. The film was shot from March to August 2011. Most of the scenes of South Ossetia were shot in Abkhazia and North Ossetia–Alania. Most extras were Abkhazians, but the characters, who speak in Ossetian, were played or were dubbed by North Ossetian actors. The official trailer was created in Trailerhouse by Sundown Entertainment.\n\nFilm distribution\nThe premiere of the film took place in Moscow on 17 February 2012 at the cinema Pushkinski. The film was released across Russia on 21 February 2012. The premiere was planned for Defender of the Fatherland Day and so the film had much competition. In the first week of distribution the film was in the lead at the box office and collected more than 140,000,000 rubles (about 5,000,000 dollars) for the first weekend. In total, August Eighth netted about 10,000,000 dollars in Russian theaters, much less than the gross of Faiziyev's previous film, Turkish Gambit. The début of the film with English subtitles took place in Australia on 1 September 2012 under the title August 8th at the Russian Resurrection Film Festival 2012.\n\nHome media\nIn Russia, the film was released on DVD on 22 March 2012 and on Blu-ray on 14 June 2012. Neither edition contains any subtitles. A French dub of the movie called War Zone was released on DVD and Blu-ray in France on 7 August 2013.\n\nSee also\nOlympus Inferno\n5 Days of War\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website (in Russian)\nAugust Eighth at IMDb",

    "text": "Illicium floridanum (also known as purple anise, Florida anise, stink-bush, or star-anise) is an evergreen shrub native to the Gulf Coast area of the Southern United States, from Florida to Louisiana.\n\nDescription\nThe Florida anise tree has large evergreen lance shaped leaves that are lustrous and dark green. When crushed the leaf has a sweet odor, described as being \"anise-like\". The leaf of this plant has a parallel main vein. Within the leaf of this shrub, a flower also grows. The flower has 20 to 30 maroon-colored petals.  The petals are typically 2 inches (5 cm) in diameter. The flower is attractive, and it is often overlooked within the lush shiny foliage, but has a fish-like odor. If the flower is ripe, the seed explodes out of the star-shaped fruit. This plant has a variety that can be produced in cultivation through selective breeding. Depending on the breeding, white flowers can be observed.\n\nTaxonomy\nThe Illicium floridanum plant was first discovered in 1765 by the servant of a man named William Clifton, Esq. of West Florida. It was first observed growing in a swamp near Pensacola. In 1766, King George III's botanist, John Bartram, found the Illicium flordianum plant on the bank of St. Johns River in East Florida. He made a drawing of the plant and described its petals, leaves, and type of tree it was.\n\nDistribution and habitat\nThis perennial plant is found in northern Florida and Georgia, as well as along the coastal plain toward Louisiana. The Illicium floridanum plant is endangered in Georgia.  This plant species  in those areas are known to be toxic. The Illicium floridanum shrub can be seen growing in wetlands, but can also be found in non-wetland areas. It grows in partial to fully shaded areas. However, it can survive in sunny areas, as long as it is being watered well. The soil for this plant should be moist, mulched and watered, especially during periods of dryness.\n\nUses\nIllicium floridanum should not be ingested, and is not considered an alternative to a culinary spice. However, there is a similar species, the Chinese plant known as Illicium verum, which is used as a spice, and the oil of which is used in medicine and to flavor alcoholic beverages.\n\nEtymology\nIllicium is derived from Latin and means 'seductive'. The name is in reference to the plant's fragrance.\nFloridanum means 'from Florida'.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "Cuties",
    "text": "Cuties (French: Mignonnes) is a 2020 French coming-of-age drama film written and directed by Maïmouna Doucouré in her feature directorial debut. The film's ensemble cast is led by Fathia Youssouf who portrays Amy, a Senegalese-French girl with a traditional Muslim upbringing who is caught between traditional Muslim values and Internet culture when she joins a twerking dance crew.\nDoucouré was inspired to write the script upon seeing a suggestive youth talent show one day, as well as from her experience as a Senegalese-French person. She said that it is intended to criticise the hypersexualisation of pre-adolescent girls, and that she logged over 18 months of research on the topic. The script later won an award at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival. Casting took six months, with 700 girls being auditioned for the role of Amy. Principal photography lasted three months, with a psychologist assisting the child actresses throughout.\nCuties premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival on 23 January, where Doucouré won the Directing Award. It was released in France on 19 August 2020 by BAC Films and internationally on 9 September 2020 on Netflix. While critical response to the film was mostly positive, including some award nominations, it became a subject of controversy, starting from Netflix's initial promotional poster that was widely considered inappropriate. Following its release on Netflix, the film polarized audiences, in part due to sexually suggestive scenes involving the child actors.\n\nPlot\nAmy, an 11-year-old girl from Senegal, lives with her mother Mariam and two younger brothers, one of them named Ishmael, in an apartment in one of Paris' poorest neighbourhoods. She is angered by her polygynous father, who is preparing to return with a second wife. She is also bored with Islamic culture that her aunt seeks to impose on her. Amy is fascinated by her disobedient neighbour Angelica's pre-teen twerking clique, the Cuties, which is in stark contrast to Mariam's Muslim customs. They do not hesitate to adopt revealing outfits against their older rivals, the Sweety Swags. In the quest for online recognition, Amy decides to incorporate suggestive dance moves into the choreography. After getting pantsed for fighting with Sweety Swags, she steals her cousin’s phone and sends a photo of her vulva online to a social network in an attempt to look mature, backfiring heavily with her being ostracised, also causing a rift between her and the Cuties who kick her out, replaced with former member Yasmine. Her mother also confronts her for committing such indecency. She and her aunt try performing an exorcism on Amy, but it fails.\nWhile her father's wedding day corresponds to the finale at the Parc de la Villette, she is determined to dance with them, and sneaks out of the house. She pushes Yasmine into a canal, so the Cuties have no choice but to allow her to dance with them. The highly suggestive dance routine polarizes audiences. Suddenly thinking about her mother during the routine, Amy bursts into tears and leaves before their performance ends. Upon her return, she runs into her aunt, who blames her for her outfit and recent attitude. Amy's mother intervenes by telling her to leave her daughter alone and then hugs her to reassure her. Amy implores her mother to not attend the wedding. Amy's mother permits her not to go, but states that she herself must go to fulfill her duty as a wife. In the end, Amy abandons both the traditional wedding dress and her provocative dancer's outfit, living a normal youth lifestyle.\n\nCast\nFathia Youssouf as Amy\nMédina El Aidi-Azouni as Angelica\nMaïmouna Gueye as Mariam, Amy's mother\nEsther Gohourou as Coumba, a member of the Cuties\nIlanah Cami-Goursolas as Jess, another member of the Cuties\nMyriam Hamma as Yasmine, another member of the Cuties\nMbissine Therese Diop as Amy's aunt\nDemba Diaw as Ishmael, Amy's brother\nMamadou Samaké as Samba\n\nProduction\nThe film was announced by filmmaker Maïmouna Doucouré as her feature debut directorial venture. She rose to prominence with her 2016 short film Maman(s), which was selected and premiered in over two hundred film festivals, and won around sixty awards in several international film festivals.\nDoucouré penned the script for Cuties, taking her life experience as a refugee girl into account. The script eventually won Sundance's Global Filmmaking Award in 2017. Doucouré says her inspiration for the film was a talent show in Paris that she happened to see. She says that the contrast of the dancing and the traditional garb of the families in the audience was fascinating. She also based it on her own experience with the contrast of the cultures of France and Senegal.\nDoucouré spent nearly 18 months researching studies on how young and pre-teen children are being exposed to adult content and sexualised images on social media in order to showcase the accurate reality in the film. She spoke to many young girls about these issues. She says that the film deals with self-image and social media. \"Our girls see that the more a woman is overly sexualised on social media, the more she is successful. Children just imitate what they see, trying to achieve the same result without understanding the meaning. It is dangerous.\" She says that although watching the film may be difficult, it is important to have a conversation in society about these issues.\nCasting for the film took nearly six months. Approximately 650 girls auditioned for the main character Amy; ultimately, 11-year-old Fathia Youssouf was chosen. Principal photography took place in various locations around France over a period of three months. Doucouré said she \"created a climate of trust\" between the young actors and herself during filming. She stated while working on the film, \"I explained to them everything I was doing and the research that I had done before I wrote this story. I was also lucky that these girls' parents were also activists, so we were all on the same side. At their age, they've seen this kind of dance. Any child with a telephone can find these images on social media these days.\" She also stated that a child psychologist was on staff during filming.\n\nInitial release\nCuties had its world premiere in the World Cinema Dramatic Competition section of the 2020 Sundance Film Festival on 23 January, where Doucouré won the Directing Award, and was one of three French films to be screened at festival. Originally set for a theatrical release in France on 1 April 2020, the film was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in France, and was eventually released on 19 August 2020 by BAC Films. The film earned US$692,459; in its opening day it earned US$644,309 at 169 theaters.\n\nNetflix release\nIn January 2020, prior to the film's Sundance premiere, Netflix purchased the worldwide rights to the film, excluding France. It was released internationally on Netflix on 9 September 2020. Cuties was removed from Netflix's catalogue on 8 September 2024 after Netflix's license to stream the film expired.\n\nMarketing\nPrior to its release on Netflix, the film had not been deemed controversial when it was screened at Sundance and released in France. After Netflix acquired Cuties, its international promotional poster and trailer for the film were criticised for allegedly sexualising 11-year-old girls and were different from those used to promote the film in its original release in France. The Parents Television Council (PTC) requested that Netflix remove the film entirely, and a Change.org petition calling for people to cancel their Netflix subscription gathered more than 600,000 signatures. Followers of QAnon on social media also criticised the film, and a moderator on the movies and television board of 4chan banned images pertaining to the film from being posted on the imageboard site. In Latin America, #NetflixPedofilia trended on Twitter prior to the film's Netflix release.\nIn response, Netflix replaced the poster with a new one, stating, \"This was not an accurate representation of the film so the image and description has been updated.\" The new poster was replaced with that of the original theatrical release, depicting the girls running in the street with shopping bags while celebrating.\nAmidst the controversy, American actress Tessa Thompson came out in support of the film when it was criticised on social media, stating that \"Cuties is a beautiful film\" and said that the film \"gutted me\" when she saw it for the first time during the Sundance premiere.\nIn Turkey, the Ministry of Family asked Radio and Television Supreme Council (RTÜK) to take the necessary precautions and evaluate the film; RTÜK subsequently demanded the film be removed from the Netflix catalogue. Netflix removed the film from its catalogue in Turkey two days before its release. In September 2020, Pakistani actor Hamza Ali Abbasi signed one of the petitions and demanded Netflix cancel their planned release of the film. Adriana Martínez Bedini, vice-president of Buenos Aires' Consejo de los Derechos de Niñas, Niños y Adolescentes (Council for the Rights of Girls, Boys and Teenagers), called for \"being very careful not to eroticize childhood. Its consequences in society can be serious\", adding that the topic would be included in the council plenary.\nIn an interview with Deadline Hollywood, Maïmouna Doucouré stated that she received numerous death threats and personal attacks following the backlash on social media. She claimed that things happened fairly quickly (after delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic); she was focusing solely on the film's theatrical release in France, and at the time was not consulted about the controversial poster unveiled by Netflix. She said that she was notified of the film's poster controversy after being informed of negative feedback and reviews from the public on social media, and that the co-CEO of Netflix phoned her directly and apologised for the poster release.\n\nInternational release\nOn 10 September, #CancelNetflix started trending on Twitter in the United States (one day after the release of the film internationally) with The Guardian saying that opposition came from across the political spectrum. Michelle Jaworski of The Daily Dot said that part of the outrage was based on clips of the film that were taken out of context. Subscribers of Netflix repeatedly threatened to cancel their subscriptions following the release of the film on the platform. It became the second Netflix film in 2020 to have received severe backlash and condemnation among the public regarding accusations of inappropriate culture portrayal, following 365 Days. Shortly after its release on Netflix, Cuties had an IMDb rating of 1.7/10, and was review bombed on most review platforms.\nIn response, Netflix defended Cuties, saying that the film is a piece of \"social commentary against the sexualisation of young children\" and encouraged subscribers to watch it. In a further interview, Doucouré claimed that people upset with her film have not streamed it, stating: \"I realise that the people who have started this controversy haven't yet seen the film. Netflix has apologised to the public and to myself. I'm hoping that these people will watch the movie now that it's out. I'm eager to see their reaction when they realise that we're both on the same side of this fight against young children's hypersexualisation.\"\nThe National Center on Sexual Exploitation, a conservative religious organisation formerly known as Morality in Media, condemned Netflix for giving a film \"that has permitted the sexual exploitation of children\" a platform and called for the company to cut the \"sexually-exploitative scenes or stop hosting this film at all\".\nForbes noted that the film does not contain any child pornography, such as explicit nudity of a minor. The French directors guild criticised the backlash against the film, calling it a \"grave attack on freedom of creation\" being fueled by \"the most conservative of Americans.\" French organisation UniFrance also condemned the backlash towards the film, saying in a statement that the backlash \"pose[s] a serious threat to the very space that cinema seeks to open up: a space of discussion, reflection, and of helping us to see beyond our own preconceived ideas.\"\nDespite the controversy, the film reached the top 5 on Netflix in the United States, as well as the top 10 in 17 other countries. In a poll by Screen Engine/ASI of 96 U.S. Netflix subscribers 52% of people said they only watched the film due to the controversy, while 29% said it was a major factor in their choice to watch the film. After watching the film 72% said the controversy was \"overblown\" with 38% strongly agreeing. Overall 48% strongly agreed that the film should not be available on Netflix, while 17% somewhat agreed.\nHowever, it has also been noted that there was a decrease in renewals to Netflix, likely due to the film. The days after the film's release saw an eight times increase in the number of cancellations of Netflix subscriptions than typical, reaching \"a multi-year high\", according to data analytics companies Antenna and YipitData. Research firm 7Park Data noted that the surge in Netflix cancellations died down within a week of the initial uproar.\nIn September 2020, in an interview hosted by UniFrance, Doucouré reflected that the film became controversial primarily due to the artwork used by Netflix. In the interview, she rejected the claim that the controversy originated in cultural differences between European and American viewers. She insisted that she shares the spirit and fight against sexualisation of children similar to those who  criticised the film. Doucouré reaffirmed her intentions for making the film in an op-ed for The Washington Post, and responded to the controversy saying, \"The movie has certainly started a debate, though not the one that I intended.\" She also said, \"It's my sincerest hope that this conversation doesn't become so difficult that it too gets caught up in today's 'cancel culture.'\"\n\nU.S. political responses\nU.S. Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri informally invited Netflix to discuss the film \"before Congress\" in a tweet. U.S. Senator Mike Lee of Utah sent a letter directly to Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, and requested \"an explanation on Hasting's [sic] views as to whether or not the potential exploitation of minors in this film constitutes criminal behavior\". U.S. House Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii explicitly called the film \"child porn\" and that it would \"whet the appetite of pedophiles [and] help fuel the child sex trafficking trade.\" U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas sent a letter to the Department of Justice to \"investigate whether Netflix, its executives, or the filmmakers violated any federal laws against the production and distribution of child pornography.\" Christine Pelosi, daughter of U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, stated that Cuties \"hypersexualises girls my daughter's age no doubt to the delight of pedophiles like the ones I prosecuted.\" Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Representative Jim Banks of Indiana also both criticised the film in separate statements, calling for the U.S. Department of Justice to take legal action against Netflix, with Cotton saying \"There's no excuse for the sexualisation of children, and Netflix's decision to promote the film Cuties is disgusting at best and a serious crime at worst\". Representatives Ken Buck of Colorado and Andy Biggs of Arizona also called for the Department of Justice to investigate. The state attorneys general of Ohio, Florida, Louisiana, and Texas have also written a letter to Netflix asking for removal of the film. Donald Trump Jr., son of then-President Donald Trump, also condemned the film in a campaign event in Arizona saying \"You know what the left is doing? They're justifying Cuties, they're justifying pedophilia.\"\nOn 23 September 2020, Netflix was indicted by a grand jury in Tyler County, Texas, on a charge that it \"depicts the lewd exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of a clothed or partially clothed child who was younger than 18 years of age ... and has no serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\" In response, Netflix continued to defend the film in a statement saying, \"Cuties is a social commentary against the sexualization of young children. This charge is without merit and we stand by the film.\" Thomas Leatherbury, director of the First Amendment clinic at Southern Methodist University, said the indictment was an \"unusual test case\", adding that it's \"troubling\" that there is a \"criminal charge related to First Amendment activity, particularly expressive activity, like a movie.\" The Texas-based defense lawyer Paul Saputo called the indictment \"one of 'the dumbest and most absurd' in the state\", noting its win at Sundance qualifies the film as having serious artistic value. Former federal prosecutor Duncan Levin also stated that the indictment was \"more of a culture wars attack on a sexualized film than a law enforcement issue.\" The National Society of Film Critics also spoke out against the indictment, calling it \"utterly baseless\" and \"absurd\". The case was dismissed without prejudice in 2022.\n\nNetflix responses\nOn 12 October 2020, during a MIPCOM Online+ keynote address, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos continued to defend the film. \"Frankly, I'm surprised there hasn't been more discussion about the First Amendment implications of this film. It's a film I would argue is very misunderstood with some audiences, uniquely in the United States...It's the director's story and the film has obviously played very well at Sundance, without any of this kind of controversy and played in theaters throughout Europe without any of this controversy, ...I think it's a little surprising that in 2020 in America, we're having a discussion about censoring storytelling.\"\nIn November 2020, it was reported that Netflix sent dozens of takedown requests to Twitter targeting specific posts that criticise Cuties. One user whose tweets were removed said it was \"a clear violation of our First Amendment rights\", while another user stated it was \"just sad\", and added \"shame on Netflix and Twitter for taking away people's voices. That is how I feel.\" TorrentFreak said the cluster of copyright claims by Netflix was unusual.\n\nReception\nCritical response\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 86% based on 81 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \"A thoughtful look at the intricacies of girlhood in the modern age, Cuties is a coming-of-age film that confronts its themes with poignancy and nuance.\" At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\nMonica Castillo of RogerEbert.com gave the film four out of four stars, stating that \"Cuties is a difficult and challenging film, pushing the idea of 'depiction does not equal endorsement' to its limit.\" In a review for IndieWire, Kate Erbland wrote, \"Although Doucouré steeps Cuties in emotion and experience, she abandons its grace to make crazier gestures.\" Variety's Amy Nicholson wrote: \"Newcomer Youssouf has an anchoring presence. Occasionally, Doucouré lets her light up the screen with a smile, and at the director's most expressionistic, the girl floats\", though it stated the film is aiming to gain more \"gasps than laughs\" with its dance numbers. Other reviewers commented that the film is intended to criticise \"a culture that steers impressionable young girls toward the hypersexualisation of their bodies\" and \"seems to want to provoke censure\". Clarisse Fabre of Le Monde praised the film and said that it avoids judging the sexualised dances of the girls.\nFrench newspaper Libération described the film as \"endearing but too demonstrative\", adding that \"the film remains on the threshold of the discomfort that it intends to press each time it meets the male gaze, as if it was afraid to blame it head on\". According to France Info, \"Mignonnes' words are a subtle reflection on the condition of women when childhood and innocence discreetly recede\" and a \"female cast carried by the intensity of the young Fathia Youssouf, a revelation\".\nDavid Fear of Rolling Stone rated the film 3 out of 5 stars, calling it a \"sensitive portrait of growing pains that deserves to be seen\". Common Sense Media gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and wrote that \"Maïmouna Doucouré has created an evocative, compassionate portrait of young girls finding their identity and values\". Alyssa Rosenberg of The Washington Post defended the film, stating that the film would be liked by those who have not seen a glimpse of it yet, and she also criticised the remarks made against the film. Carlos Aguilar of TheWrap compared Cuties to films such as Girlhood (2014), The Fits (2015) and Atlantics (2019).\nFionnuala Halligan of Screen Daily, however, commented on the close-up minor shots: \"Doucouré seems to want to provoke censure, but fails precisely because she's trying so hard.\" She also called the musical shots \"outrageous\", but also said that \"[a]ll four Cuties members give excellent performances.\" Yvonne Bohwongprasert of the Bangkok Post stated that the film's storyline \"sexualises the girls in a manner that would pander to the desires of a paedophile\" with \"a plot that really does not make sense.\"\n\nAccolades\nSee also\nAnti-pedophile activism – Form of activism\nBombay Begums – Indian drama series\nSexualization in child beauty pageants\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nCuties at IMDb",

    "title": "Under Fire (1983 film)",
    "text": "Under Fire is a 1983 American political thriller film set during the last days of the Nicaraguan Revolution that ended the Somoza regime in 1979. Directed by Roger Spottiswoode, it stars Nick Nolte, Gene Hackman and Joanna Cassidy. The musical score by Jerry Goldsmith, which featured jazz guitarist Pat Metheny, was nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Score. The editing by Mark Conte and John Bloom was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Editing. The film was shot in the Mexican states of Chiapas and Oaxaca.\n\nPlot\nRussell Price is a photojournalist covering a military conflict in Chad, where he runs into Oates, a mercenary who he knows. Russell then returns to his hotel, where he attends a \"Bon Voyage\" party for his friend Alex Grazier, who is giving up covering foreign conflicts to take a lucrative job as a news anchor in New York. It is revealed that Russell is having an affair with Alex's girlfriend, fellow journalist Claire Stryder. Alex's article about the conflict in Chad is paired with Russell's photography to land a cover story in Time magazine.\nThe journalists then travel to Nicaragua to join the international press corps covering a conflict between the government of President Somoza and rebels led by Rafael, an underground figure who has never been photographed. Russell is arrested for no legitimate reason and spends a night in jail. He and Claire meet Marcel Jazy, a French spy who is closely connected to Somoza, who tips them off that they might find Rafael in León, even though the press corps believes the fighting is shifting to Masaya.\nThey go to León and cover an intense rooftop gun battle between rebels and government troops. Russell meets rebels led by Pedro who gives him a baseball to take to Dennis Martinez. After more fighting, Russell again meets Oates, who is now fighting for the Nicaraguan government. Afterwards, Oates shoots Pedro in the back, killing him, but Russell does not reveal Oates' location, in order to avoid picking a side in the conflict.\nClaire and Russell attend a press conference where President Somoza announces that Rafael has been killed. They then meet rebels who promise to take them to meet Rafael. Led to a remote rebel stronghold, they realize that Rafael is indeed dead, and the rebels ask Russell to fake a living photo of their leader, believing this will sustain the movement long enough to win a victory. Although conflicted, Claire and Russell agree to help the rebels.\nThe photo is a success, and Alex comes to Nicaragua to get Russell to arrange an interview with Rafael. Alex learns of Russell's affair with his girlfriend, but does not sever his relationship with the photographer. The two go to find Rafael as the war escalates. They are detained and again meet Oates, who this time is with government troops who are conducting a mass execution. Russell learns from Oates that Jazy has been using him to get photographs of rebel leaders, who are then targeted for assassination.\nAlex learns that Rafael is dead and Claire and Russell have violated journalistic ethics. Nevertheless, he agrees to not expose them, and will do a fluff piece on Jazy instead. Russell tries to arrange the interview, but fighting has become even more intense as the government is losing the war. Lost on their way back to the hotel, Alex asks government troops for assistance, but they are paranoid and execute him in the street while Russell takes pictures. Russell then escapes from the troops with the help of a local woman who hides him in her home.\nRealizing it will end his regime if it is revealed that government troops killed a famous American journalist, President Somoza reports that rebels killed Alex and troops desperately search for Russell to kill him and destroy the pictures. Russell witnesses rebels killing Jazy. Claire is able to get the negatives back to the hotel, then goes to find Russell.\nRussell's photographs are broadcast worldwide and Somoza flees to Miami. With the rebels victorious, Claire and Russell are reunited and leave the country. In the final scene, she asks \"Do you think we fell in love with too much?\", and he replies \"I'd do it again\".\n\nCast\nHistorical basis\nThough the film is largely fictional, it was inspired by the murder of ABC reporter Bill Stewart and his translator Juan Espinoza by Nicaraguan National Guard troops on June 20, 1979. ABC cameraman Jack Clark was shooting \"incidental\" footage, and caught the entire episode on tape. The footage was shown on national television in the United States and became a major international incident, undermining what remained of dictator Anastasio Somoza's support. The US Government had already stopped military aid to Nicaragua and its National Guard in 1978, but the incident was the final straw for the Carter Administration's relationship with Somoza, whose regime fell on July 19.\n\nReception\nBox office\nUnder Fire opened October 21, 1983 in 816 theaters, earning $1,837,768 ($2,252 average per theater) its opening weekend.  The film went on to gross a total of $5,696,391 in North America.\n\nCritical response\nUnder Fire received a positive response from critics and holds a 91% \"Fresh\" rating on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes from 22 reviews.\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film three and a half out of four stars, praising the performances and declaring it one of the year's best films, saying, \"The actors in Under Fire never step wrong. Nolte is great to watch as the seedy photographer with the beer gut. Hackman never really convinced me that he could be an anchorman, but he did a better thing. He convinced me that he thought he could be one. Joanna Cassidy takes a role that could have been dismissed as 'the girl' and fills it out as a fascinating, textured adult. Under Fire surrounds these performances with a vivid sense of place and becomes, somewhat surprisingly, one of the year's best films.\"  Geoff Andrew of Time Out praised the film as \"tak[ing] an honourable place alongside classic war-torn romance pictures like Casablanca and To Have and Have Not\" and concluded by calling it \"a thrilling film, with a head, a heart, and muscle.\"\nJohn Simon of National Review wrote: \"Under Fire is no masterpiece, but it gives you plenty to absorb and think about. How many films nowadays can make that claim?\"\nVincent Canby of The New York Times, however, viewed the film less favorably, saying \"Under Fire, which was written by Ron Shelton and Clayton Frohman, from a story by Mr. Frohman, means well but it is fatally confused. It's silly enough to use a real, bloody war as the backdrop - the excuse, really - for the raising of the consciousnesses of a couple of mini-characters.\"\n\nSee also\nSalvador – 1986 war drama film directed by Oliver Stone\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nUnder Fire at IMDb\nUnder Fire at Box Office Mojo\nUnder Fire at the AFI Catalog of Feature Films\nUnder Fire (1983) movie script sfy.ru\nUnder Fire at Rotten Tomatoes",

    "title": "Reddit API controversy",
    "text": "In April 2023, the discussion and news aggregation website Reddit announced its intentions to charge for its application programming interface (API), a feature which had been free since 2008, causing a dispute. The move forced multiple third-party applications to shut down and threatened accessibility applications and moderation tools.\nOn May 31, Christian Selig, the developer of Apollo, an alternative client for Reddit, stated that Reddit's pricing would force him to cease development on the app. The resulting outcry from the Reddit community ultimately led to a planned protest, from June 12 to 14 in which moderators for the site would make their communities private or would restrict posting. Following the release of an internal memo from Reddit CEO Steve Huffman and defiance from Reddit, some moderators continued their protest.\nAlternate forms of protest emerged in the days following the initial blackout. Upon reopening, users of the r/pics, r/gifs, and r/aww subreddits voted to exclusively post about comedian John Oliver. Multiple subreddits labeled themselves as not safe for work (NSFW), affecting Reddit's advertisements. In response, administrators removed the entire moderation team of some subreddits. A Reddit spokesperson said the removals were due to a violation of Reddit's Content Policy and Moderator Code of Conduct, which prohibits moderators from incorrectly marking a community as NSFW. Several moderation teams were eventually reinstated. The protest has been compared to a strike. The third iteration of r/place was covered with various messages attacking Huffman, including the final result.\n\nBackground\nReddit is a news aggregation and discussion website. Posts are organized into \"subreddits\", individualized user-created boards moderated by users. In 2008, Reddit introduced its application programming interface (API), granting developers access to the site's corpus of posts and comments. Developers have used Reddit's free API to develop moderation tools and third-party applications; the API has also been used to train large language models (LLMs), including ChatGPT and Google's chatbot Gemini.\nSubreddit moderators have leveraged their subreddits en masse in the past to protest decisions that Reddit has made. In the self-described \"Great Reddit Blackout of 2015\", users publicly disagreed with the company over the termination of Victoria Taylor, a Reddit employee who held Ask Me Anythings (AMAs) and was vital to r/IAmA. In 2021, Reddit hired Aimee Knight, whose father, David Challenor, was convicted earlier that year for raping and torturing a 10-year-old child, resulting in another blackout.\n\nAPI changes\nOn April 18, 2023, Reddit announced it would charge for its API service amid a potential initial public offering. Speaking to The New York Times' Mike Isaac, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said, \"The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable, but we don't need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free\". In spite of those changes, Huffman said that the API would continue to be available for free for developers who create moderation tools or researchers who use Reddit's data for academic purposes. Announcing the changes, Reddit stated that the Reddit data aggregation site Pushshift—whose service was used by LLMs—violated its API rules; the company also said it would restrict access to adult content.\nQuoting their explanation of a previous protest that complained about how Reddit made major changes to the site without “any apparent care” to how it would affect moderators, the moderators of r/IAmA stated they would no longer solicit AMAs from notable figures. Because the third-party apps they previously used to moderate their subreddit would no longer work, and criticizing Reddit’s lack of response on making the official app accessible,  the moderators of r/Blind stated that they could no longer moderate on mobile.\n\nImpact on third-party applications\nOn May 31, Christian Selig, the developer of the third-party Reddit client Apollo, said that he was quoted US$12,000 for 50 million requests and could be forced to pay US$20 million per year in order to continue to operate. Selig stated that he could not pay Reddit's pricing and was unsure of how to even charge it. Speaking to The Verge, he posed that Reddit's pricing could present an existential risk for Reddit clients such as Rif Is Fun for Reddit (RIF) and Relay.\nOn June 8, Selig announced that he would shut down Apollo on June 30. In a Reddit post, he alleged that Huffman told employees that Selig was blackmailing the company out of US$10 million; Selig provided audio recordings between himself and a Reddit employee disproving the claim. His announcement was accompanied by other similar statements, including from RIF developer Andrew Shu, who cited Reddit's \"hostile treatment of developers building on their platform\" and a high API cost. Other third-party Reddit apps, such as Sync for Reddit and ReddPlanet, have also announced that they will shut down.\nAmid concerns that these applications could no longer work, Reddit responded by stating that it would give \"non-commercial, accessibility-focused\" apps an exception from their pricing terms. A moderator of r/Blind contended that they had received no clarification from Reddit about how it would be defining \"accessibility-focused apps\". Several third-party applications with extensive accessibility features were later confirmed to be given an exemption as \"non-commercial accessibility-focused\" applications. RedReader and Dystopia have received exemptions. Additionally, Huffman provided an exemption for \"third-party moderation [tools]\"; former Ars Technica writer and moderator of a ZFS subreddit Jim Salter wrote to the publication that he does not know of \"anyone at all\" using such a client.\nOn June 30, Reddit's proposed changes went into effect, shutting down some third-party Reddit clients, including Apollo, Sync, BaconReader and RIF. In spite of this, Narwhal, Relay and Now for Reddit turned to a subscription model to remain profitable.\n\nReddit's reactions\nHuffman addressed several of the announced changes to the API service in an Ask Me Anything (AMA). Concerning the changes for third-party apps, he said Reddit could \"no longer subsidize commercial entities that require large-scale data use.\" He went on to say that Reddit would work to make its mobile app more accessible. Although Huffman claimed Reddit was actively in communication with many third-party application developers to aid in their continued operation, some developers commented that Reddit had not responded to them in months.\nTim Rathschmidt, a spokesperson for Reddit, told The New York Times that Reddit was in contact with communities to \"clarify any confusion around our Data API Terms, platform-wide policies, community support resources, and timing for new moderator tools.\" He added that Reddit \"needs to be fairly paid to continue supporting high-usage third-party apps\", noting that the new API pricing \"is based on usage levels that we measure to be comparable to our own costs\". Rathschmidt also stated that Reddit's hosting costs were in the multi-millions.\n\nSubreddit blackout\nIn response to Reddit's API changes, multiple subreddits announced that they would be shutting down from June 12 to June 14. Huffman's AMA resulted in some subreddits, including r/polls, going private ahead of the June 12 protest. The moderators of r/iPhone and r/Music decided to go private indefinitely beginning on June 12. Some communities proposed moving to the messaging service Discord or the Lemmy network of instances in the fediverse. Efforts to promote fediverse-based alternatives were marred with paranoia after Reddit banned users and subreddits related to Lemmy and Kbin.\nOn June 12, over 7,000 subreddits went private, including Reddit's largest subreddit, r/funny. Other large subreddits that chose to go private include r/aww, r/gaming, and r/science. Some subreddits, such as r/NintendoSwitch, r/Frugal, and r/StarWars, opted to restrict new posts. r/DankMemes only allowed users to post memes relating to the API changes. At approximately 10:58 a.m. Eastern Time, Reddit was affected by a major outage caused by \"expected stability issues\" due to the large number of subreddits going private. The outage was resolved hours later. An estimated 8,500 subreddits had gone private or restricted by June 13. Subreddits continued to protest through June 15, while subreddits like r/pics and r/art became restricted. On June 13, The Verge published an internal memo in which Huffman told employees that the protest \"will pass\". During the initial protests, some subreddits considered staying private indefinitely, including r/aww, r/music and r/videos, which continued to stay private. r/nba tweeted that it would stay private \"indefinitely\"; the decision to go private coincided with the final game of the 2023 NBA Finals. Similarly, r/philadelphia went private following the collapse of a portion of Interstate 95 in Pennsylvania, leading to angry comments from users and requests to reopen. Huffman's internal memo became the primary motivation for more than 5,000 subreddits to continue their blackout indefinitely.\nOn June 15, in the first interview since the blackout began, Huffman told NPR that a \"small group\" is \"very upset\". He reiterated that the blackout did not have effects on revenue but \"created a fair amount of trouble\". Speaking to NBC News, he compared moderators to a landed gentry (Reddit moderators were at the time and currently remain as unpaid volunteers) and said that he would be looking into implementing a democratic process to let users vote moderators out. On June 16, The Verge obtained a note Reddit sent to moderators of subreddits that were still private with offers to help remove moderators \"hindering reopening\", telling the publication that they wanted \"mods who want to mod to be able to do so.\" A Reddit administrator commented that if the moderators' decision to keep the subreddit private was unanimous, Reddit would replace them with a new team of moderators. Reddit spokesperson Rathschmidt later confirmed that moderators may be in violation of Reddit's code of conduct for keeping communities private. Fearing they would be replaced, many moderation teams, such as r/Apple's, reopened their subreddits. According to the Associated Press, around 4,000 subreddits were still private by June 16.\nSpeaking to Axios' Kerry Flynn, Reddit COO Jen Wong said that Reddit \"respects [users's] right to protest\". On June 22, Reddit began pressuring subreddits that continued their blackout to reopen, according to a message released publicly by an r/DIY moderator. Out of fear that Reddit may install new moderators, r/DIY reopened. r/TranscribersOfReddit, a subreddit that provides alternate text for images posted to Reddit, announced it would shut down on June 30.\n\nOther activities\nAlternate forms of protest\nOn June 17, r/pics and r/gifs reopened with a poll on whether their respective subreddits should be used to exclusively post about comedian John Oliver. Oliver tweeted his approval and provided pictures for users of r/pics to use. r/aww opened its subreddit a day later, only allowing \"adorable content featuring John Oliver, Chiijohn, and anything else that closely resembles them\". Similarly, r/iPhone began posting images of Apple CEO Tim Cook. r/horny became a subreddit for posting about Christianity and Minecraft (2009). The subreddits r/malefashionadvice and r/femalefashionadvice became subreddits for fashion advice relating to the 1700s, with one post on the latter referencing the character of Elizabeth Bennet from Pride and Prejudice (1813). r/steam, a subreddit for the video game distribution service Steam, began posting about literal steam.\nAs a form of protest, multiple subreddits began allowing not safe for work (NSFW) content, resulting in an influx of pornography onto some subreddits, such as r/interestingasfuck. The NSFW label prevents companies from running advertisements on these subreddits. On June 20, Reddit began removing moderators who labeled their communities as NSFW. The move, in accordance with Reddit's policies, left r/MildlyInteresting, r/interestingasfuck, r/TIHI, and r/ShittyLifeProTips—subreddits with millions of subscribers—unmoderated. Conversely, r/PoliticalHumor gave all users moderator permissions, referring to Huffman's \"landed gentry\" comment. Moderators of r/scams have begun approving content at a deliberately slow pace; in some circumstances, up to two weeks. BotDefense, a crowd-sourced community effort to remove bots on Reddit, left the site in July.\n\nOn July 20, Reddit began its third iteration of r/place, an interactive canvas in which users can only place one pixel every five minutes, announcing it one day earlier. Normally, r/place takes place every five years since April 1, 2017. Users organized to create a subreddit to protest the API on the canvas, and numerous messages of \"Fuck spez\"—referring to Huffman's Reddit username—were written. Additionally, German users wrote, \"spez ist ein Hurensohn\" (spez is a son of a bitch). The canvas was expanded two days later, leading to more messages critical of Huffman, although they were largely overwritten in favor of art. On the final day of r/place, users wrote, \"Fuck Spez\", in all caps, comprising most of the canvas.\nOn July 21, participants on r/place, collectively generated a visual representation featuring a guillotine. This depiction included the likeness of the Reddit mascot, Snoo, positioned atop the guillotine's block, with the name \"spez\" inscribed on it.\n\nData hack\nThe ransomware group BlackCat threatened to release 80 gigabytes of data if Reddit does not pay US$4.5 million and undo the API changes. Reddit had previously confirmed a security incident that took place in February which compromised \"internal documents, code, and some internal business systems.\" A spokesperson confirmed that BlackCat is related to that February incident.\n\nSubreddit takeovers\nOn July 21, Reddit took over the subreddit r/malefashionadvice through an account named \"ModCodeofConduct\" amid pushes for the subreddit's community to move to Discord and Substack; ModCodeofConduct is the sole moderator of several other subreddits, including r/ShittyLifeProTips, r/AccidentalRenaissance, and r/oldbabies. Through the ModCodeofConduct account, Reddit administrators sought new moderators for these subreddits. A moderator for r/AccidentalRenaissance told Ars Technica that new moderators would find the task challenging, given that they would be subject to \"the worst photos they could imagine\", including child pornography, dying children and animals, and human feces. The moderator described how previous moderators of r/AccidentalRenaissance had \"art history backgrounds, formal education, and an instinctual grasp of what makes a photo 'Renaissance.'\", qualifications disregarded by Reddit; they further noted that the subreddit's contents \"now [...] are simply 'Not Renaissance.'\", and criticized Reddit's choice of moderators.\n\nReactions\nReddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian tweeted, \"Online community-building is more like IRL community-building than people realize\", in an apparent reference to the backlash to Reddit's API changes.\nOn June 29, Mojang Studios, the developers of Minecraft, would cease posting game updates and official content onto Reddit, citing moderation and rule changes. Though owned by Microsoft under its Xbox division, the policy implemented by Minecraft developers did not extend to all Microsoft and Xbox brands. A Mojang representative noted that the company would reconsider if Reddit's API rules change.\n\nAnalysis\nColumnist Megan McArdle compared Reddit to the nonprofit organization Goodwill and said that the site's moderators have \"essentially gone on strike\". The Verge reporter Jay Peters noted that the quality of Google Search results decreased, citing the lack of resources for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (2023), among other grievances. John Herrman of Intelligencer made a similar comment. Casey Newton drew attention to a comment Huffman made praising Elon Musk for his tenure as Twitter's CEO; among Musk's decisions as CEO was to remove Twitter's free tier for its API. In an all-hands meeting, Google senior vice president Prabhakar Raghavan admitted users were \"not quite happy\" with Google's search results after the blackout.\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nIsaac, Mike (June 23, 2023). \"Reddit's Chief Says He Wants It to 'Grow Up.'

    "text": "Sutee Suksomkit (Thai: สุธี สุขสมกิจ, born 5 June 1978) is a Thai professional football manager and former player.\nHe is known for his skillful style of play, Sutee, nicknamed \"Bird\". He spent 8 years between 2001 and 2009 playing abroad for several clubs in Singapore and Australia. He also played for Thailand at international level from 2000 to 2012, earning 70 caps.\n\nClub career\nSutee spent his youth career during 1995–1996 with an Asian powerhouse, Thai Farmers Bank. The club was recently emerged champions of AFC Champions League (Asian Club Championship) twice consecutively between 1993 and 1995. The young striker made his first senior appearance with the club in 1996 and continued playing for the club totally 5 years until 2001.\nThe pacey forward scored 39 goals from 78 appearances for Thai Farmers Bank.\nIn 2001, the promising forward joined a Singapore S-League club, Tanjong Pagar. He later adapted to play in various attacking positions including left winger, second striker and attacking midfielder.

The English club did not sign him afterward.\nBetween 2004 and 2005, an English Premier League club, Chelsea, had expressed their interest in signing the Thai forward. Chelsea eventually captured Sutee on a loan deal and sent him out to Brentford. However, Chelsea failed to apply a work permit for Sutee, caused him to return to Singapore.\nWith Home United, the Thai attacker did not score as many as he previously did with his former clubs, as he was placed in either wider position or drop deeper position in many occasions.

    "text": "Danica Šantel (1887 – May 1921) was a Slovenian teacher, amateur artist and artist's model. She was part of the prominent family of artists and educators from Gorizia. She appears in lots of artworks by her mother or siblings.\n\nEarly life\nDanica Šantel was born in 1887 in Gorizia into a nationally conscious Slovenian family.\nHer mother, Avgusta von Aigentler (1852–1935), also known as Avgusta Aigentler Šantel, was a painter and later a painting teacher at the Girls' High School in Gorizia, Her father, Anton Šantel (1845–1920), was a teacher of mathematics and physics at the Gorizia high school.\nShe was the youngest of seven children, four of whom reached adulthood: painter Henrika Šantel (1874–1940), painter, teacher and printmaker Avgusta Šantel (1876–1968), and painter and composer Saša Šantel (1883–1945) and her. Her first drawing teacher was her mother.\n\nCareer\nAfter completing primary school, in 1902 she began attending the teacher training college.\nThere, in 1906, she graduated as a teacher for elementary schools with Slovenian and German as the languages of instruction. That same year, she took a position as a teacher at an elementary school in Gorizia, where she worked for two years. In 1908, she passed the exam to teach handicrafts in elementary and middle schools. That same year, together with her sister Avgusta, she attended a summer landscape course with the Austrian painter Margarete Stall. Upon returning to Gorizia, she was employed as a teacher of decorative drawing at the women’s vocational school in Gorizia, where she worked for seven years, until 1915, when she had to resign due to illness. She also engaged in music.\nShe frequently posed for her mother, her sister Henrika, and her brother Saša, and she also painted herself.\nSome of her works were exhibited between 1970 and 1971 at the exhibition Painters Šantel (Slikarji Šantli) in the Gorizia Museum Nova Gorica - Kromberk, Gallery of Littoral Artists, together with works of her family members.\n\nIllness and death\nAt a young age, she contracted tuberculosis. In 1914 the World War I broke out, heavily affecting the Gorizia region. In June 1915, because of continuous Italian attacks, her family decided to leave Gorizia. They delayed their departure from day to day, waiting for her sister Avgusta, who was coming from Pula, where she was employed as a teacher with the naval forces, as they wished to leave Gorizia together. At the end of June, believing they would return by October, she and her family left Gorizia. They first went to Ljubljana, where they stayed for eight days, and then settled in Dolenjske Toplice. Her illness worsened, and after four months the family left Dolenjske Toplice for Vienna. Her mother’s sister, the mathematician Henrietta von Aigentler, who with her late husband, famous physicist Ludwig Boltzmann, had often housed her nieces in 1900s, arranged for Danica to be admitted, on 2 November, to a sanatorium for lung diseases in Alland. In early 1916 her mother, father, and sisters moved to a rented house in the village of Groisbach near the sanatorium, so they could be closer to her. Despite various treatments, her condition did not improve. After several months she was discharged from sanatorium.\nBefore the end of March 1917 she moved with her parents and sister Henrika to Krško, where her parents had purchased a villa with an orchard. There she again found acquaintances, as many refugees from Gorizia were living in Krško. Her brother Saša also lived nearby with his family. In Krško, Danica and Henrika resumed painting. Soon, however, the family again lost their home when the villa burned down on 23 February 1918. They remained in Krško as tenants until the end of the war. Her father died in 1920. After the war her health declined steadily. She was cared for by her mother and sister Henrika, with whom she shared a rented apartment. She died in May 1921 in Krško.\n\nIn her mother’s art\nDanica was portrayed by her mother at least once more in the drawing:\nDaughter Danica (ca. 1905, black chalk on paper) (Danica is depicted with her hair tied in a bun and wearing a necklace with a heart-shaped pendant around her neck.)\n\nIn her sister Henrika’s art\nHenrika Šantel portrayed her sister Danica at least five more times:\n\nSisters Avgusta and Danica with the dog Misili (1906, oil on canvas) – The sisters are depicted seated and sewing; Danica is wearing a red dress. The painting is held by the Slovene Ethnographic Museum.\nPortrait of Sister Danica (c. 1912) – Danica is portrayed in a white blouse, brown skirt, and red kerchief tied at the back, with long brown braids. She holds a green jug and a golden candlestick with a lit candle. The painting is in the Gorizia Museum Kromberk.\nSister Danica (1915, watercolor) (In the painting, Danica is sitting at a table with flowers.

    "text": "Sourav Pal (born 12 May 1955) is an Indian theoretical chemist, former professor of chemistry at IIT Bombay, and former Director of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Kolkata. He was a director of the CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory in Pune and an adjunct professor at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Kolkata.\nHe has made contributions in the field of coupled cluster-based methods of quantum chemistry. He also developed expectation value and the response properties to multi-reference coupled cluster theory, as well as extended coupled-cluster functions. He has developed a non-iterative approximation to coupled-perturbed Kohn-Sham density functional theoretic equations to calculate non-linear properties.\nHe has also made contributions in the area of reactivity descriptors; he established Hirshfeld population in the calculation of Fukui functions and developed the local hard-soft-acid-base principle for molecular recognition. He also studied anti-aromaticity in metal clusters.\n\nEducation\nSourav obtained his master's degree from the Indian Institute of Technology (Kanpur) in 1977 and his doctorate from the University of Calcutta. He worked at the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS). He was subsequently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Florida with Rodney J. Bartlett in 1986.\n\nAwards and honours\nSourav Pal is the recipient of the following awards and honors.\n\nRecipient of the first SASTRA-CNR Rao Award for excellence in chemistry and material science in 2014.\nRecipient of the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize in Chemical Sciences, 2000.\nRecipient of JC Bose National Fellowship of DST, 2008.\nRecipient of Chemical Research Society of India Silver Medal, 2009.\nElected as a Fellow of the Indian National Science Academy, New Delhi, 2003.\nElected as a Fellow of the National Academy of Sciences, India, Allahabad, 1998.\nElected as a Fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences, Bangalore, 1996.\nReceived Jagdish Shankar Memorial Lecture of the Indian National Science Academy, 2006.\nRecipient of Bimla Churn Law Memorial Lecture Award of IACS, Kolkata, 2005.\nDai-Ichi Karkaria Endowment Fellow of UICT, 2004–2005.\nRecipient of the Chemical Research Society of India medal, 2000.\nElected as a Fellow of the Maharashtra Academy of Sciences, 1994.\nRecipient of the NCL Research Foundation Scientist of the Year (1999) award.\nRecipient of the P.B.

Indian National Science Academy, from 1 January 2006.\nMember, Editorial Board, International Journal of Applied Chemistry, from 2005.\nElected as a Life Member of the Society for Scientific Values.\nMember, American Physical Society, United States.\n\nNotable research\nOn hard-soft acid-base relations\nHe has studied various properties of hardness and softness in relation to molecular properties, like polarizability. In 2002, he identified \"Bond Deformation Kernel\" to be correlated with interaction-induced shifts in O–H frequencies in halide–water clusters. His model used local polarization, which can be described by normalized-atom-condensed Fukui functions, which is the normal condensed Fukui function multiplied by the number of atoms.\n\nOn molecular properties and dynamics\nIn 1989, he developed theories for describing closed-shell molecules with non-linear electric properties. For open-shell systems, which are marked by a high degree of quasi-degeneracy, he used a multi-determinant description of reference space to formulate a coupled-cluster analytic derivative to compute the non-linear properties. Sourav has also identified the exchange effects as contributions to the static exchange potential of the molecule in electron–molecule scattering. An approximation method to calculate the resonance of molecular anions has been developed by his group. The procedure is based on the analytical continuation method.\nIn 2003, as an alternative to the Kohn–Sham density functional theoretic approach, which solves the coupled-perturbed Kohn–Sham (CPKS) procedure non-iteratively, Sourav formulated a way to obtain the derivative of the KS matrix using the finite field; the density matrix derivative is obtained by a single-step CPKS solution followed by the analytic evaluation of properties. He has implemented this in deMon2k software and used it for the calculation of electric properties. He also has used Gaussian basis sets and Born–Oppenheimer approximation to study the reactions of molecules. His study led to novel evidence of anti-aromaticity in metal clusters.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nSourav Pal on Twitter",

    "text": "Alex Cameron (born 11 September 1988) is an Australian singer-songwriter from Sydney. He is best known for his solo career, a high-concept act in which Cameron initially adopted the persona of a failed entertainer. During live performances, Cameron is often joined by saxophonist and \"business partner\" Roy Molloy. Before making music under his own name, Cameron was also a member of the electronica act Seekae, releasing three studio albums with them.\nCameron independently released his debut album, Jumping the Shark, for free on his website in 2013. In 2016, Secretly Canadian reissued the album to a wider audience and growing cult fanbase. In 2017, Cameron released his second studio album, Forced Witness, featuring contributions from Molloy, Flowers, Olsen and Jonathan Rado. His third studio album, Miami Memory, was released in September 2019. His fourth studio album, Oxy Music, was released in March 2022.\n\nCareer\n2013–2016: Jumping the Shark\nRegarding his adopted persona of that of a failed musician, Cameron notes, \"I write about the outlier, the table-for-one guy, the guy whose life is a constellation of microscopic tragedies. Failure has been underexplored in music. My characters come from a place where ambition, crippling self-doubt and tragedy intersect.\"\nAfter releasing his debut album, Jumping the Shark, for free on his website, and physically through Siberia Records, Cameron attracted the attention of indie rock duo Foxygen while performing at David Lynch's Parisian club, Silencio. Cameron toured extensively with Mac DeMarco, Kevin Morby, Unknown Mortal Orchestra and Angel Olsen in the ensuing years. While on tour with Morby in April 2016, the label Secretly Canadian announced they had signed Cameron and would be re-releasing Jumping the Shark in August 2016. Upon the announcement, Cameron issued the following statement: \"Its 2016 [sic], and its time for Alex Cameron. Entertainer. Showman. Shaman. Side by side with his business partner and saxophonist, Roy Molloy, the duo are a living and breathing story of success told through the internet; unedited, unscripted, and, up until now, to a dedicated audience of no one. Thanks to the good people at Secretly Canadian that is about to change.\"\n\n2017–2018: Forced Witness\nIn 2017, Cameron released his second studio album, Forced Witness, a departure from the mostly-electronic sound of his debut album, the album was produced by Foxygen's Jonathan Rado, and features a full-band production, including saxophonist Roy Molloy. That same year, Cameron co-wrote five tracks on The Killers' fifth studio album, Wonderful Wonderful, with frontman Brandon Flowers appearing on the closing track of Forced Witness, \"Politics of Love\".\nThe album's accompanying tour found Cameron fronting a full band – including Molloy, keyboardist Holiday Sidewinder, guitarist Justin Nijssen – and supporting The Killers on their UK and US arena tour.\n\nOn 26 September 2018, Cameron and Molloy hosted a 24-hour telethon via Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook Live with the express goal to \"save the music industry and pad our pantry out by selling 1000 records in 24 hours,\" which they succeeded in doing.\n\n2019–2020: Miami Memory\nOn 18 June 2019, Cameron announced his third studio album, Miami Memory. The album was released on 13 September 2019 via Secretly Canadian. For the album's accompanying tour, lead guitarist Lilah Larson joined Cameron's live band, replacing keyboard and backing vocalist Holiday Sidewinder, who left to focus on her solo career.\nIn 2020, Cameron co-wrote four songs on The Killers' sixth studio album, Imploding the Mirage, co-produced by Cameron's longtime producer Jonathan Rado. On May 8, 2020, Cameron released a single cover of the Paul Kelly song \"Before Too Long\".\n\n2021–present: Oxy Music\nIn July 2021, it was announced that Cameron would commence a European Tour in 2022 with Roy Molloy.\nIn November 2021, Cameron released \"Sara Jo\", the first single since 2019.\nOn 20 January 2022, Cameron announced his fourth studio album Oxy Music, to be released on 11 March 2022, and supported by a tour of North America and Europe. The album's second single, titled \"Best Life\", was released the same day accompanied by a music video directed by his ex-wife Jemima Kirke. The album features Lloyd Vines and Sleaford Mods' Jason Williamson. The album is inspired by the opioid epidemic and Nico Walker's novel Cherry. In its press release, Cameron explained: \"The album is a story, a work of fiction, mostly from the perspective of a man. Starved of meaningful purpose, confused about the state of the world, and in dire need of a reason to live. This is one of those people.\"\n\nPersonal life\nCameron started dating actress Jemima Kirke in July 2017. The couple has since separated.\n\nBacking band\nCurrent\n\nRoy Molloy – saxophone, \"business partner\" (2012–present)\nJustin Nijssen – bass guitar, guitar, backing vocals (2017–present)\nHenri Lindström – drums, percussion (2017–present)\nTim Rogers – keyboards, guitar (occasional appearances; 2017–present)\nLilah Larson – lead guitar, backing vocals (2019–present)\nJess Parsons – keyboards, backing vocals (2019–present)\nFormer\n\nHoliday Sidewinder – keyboards, backing vocals (2017–2019)\nLawrence Pike – drums (2018)\n\nDiscography\nStudio albums\nLive albums\nEPs\nAwards and nominations\nAPRA Awards\nThe APRA Awards are presented annually from 1982 by the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), \"honouring composers and songwriters\".\n\nMusic videos\nReferences\nExternal links\nAlex Cameron at AllMusic",

Short film.\nAlong with the cameramen, the Swiss Rainer Klausmann and Pole Piotr Lenar, the Munich composer of film music, Prof. Dr. Norbert J. Schneider (now known as Enjott Schneider) also regularly work closely with Odermatt.\n\nCriticism\nOdermatt worked on two of the craziest episodes of the TV shows Tatort and Polizeiruf 110, that really took off with their \"successful mix of seriousness and intelligent humour that makes a pleasant change from the monotony of crime series\" (Stern 25/1996) with a \"curious collection of crazy characters (...), providing the realistic main characters with a grotesque wallpaper as a background\" (FAZ, 17 June 1996). \"Having so much wicked humour was a rarity in the crime genre\" (Der Spiegel 24/1996).\nIn 1989, Gekauftes Glück was regarded by the press and cinemagoers as one Switzerland’s most successful films d'auteur. Critics praised the \"careful choreography of the images make a pleasant change from the usual loquaciousness of the films d’auteur in the German language\" (Frankfurter Rundschau, 11 March 1989).\nConstable Zumbühl was unsettling in its claustrophobic depiction of the closed society of a small village, where everybody knows everybody else and all of their business, \"the world in a water droplet\" (Krzysztof Kieślowski).\n\nAwards\nThe TV film Zerrissene Herzen (1996; camera: Piotr Lenar) was nominated in the competitions at the Baden-Badener Tage des Fernsehspiels TV awards.\nGekauftes Glück was awarded the R d'argento at the 1989 RiminiCinema Film Festival in Rimini.\nDie Filmbewertungsstelle Wiesbaden (Wiesbaden Film Assessment Board) commended Gekauftes Glück as \"recommended\" and Mein Kampf as \"highly recommended\".\n\nTheatre productions\nStage adaptations\n2005 – Dieses.

Neues Theater, Halle (Saale).\n\nDirecting style\n\"...as (...) an example of the broad spectrum of directing styles in plays staged at the Saarländischen Staatstheater, by far the most unsettling are those that defy expectations of spoken drama and are reputed to be those present in the work of film and theatre director Urs Odermatt. His premieres of Rolf Kemnitzer’s Die Bauchgeburt and Alfred Gulden’s grotesque Dieses. Kleine. Land. confronted audiences with a barrage of signs and symbols conveyed through language and physical gestures. A plethora of information and impulses through the use of an edited film and video-clip aesthetic drew attention to our truncated, edited perception of reality and the nature of our connections of meanings and contextualisation as a construct of our perspective. The viewer is required to forego entirely his contemplative attitude towards that which is presented, and be consciously selective in his perception. The border with that which is experienced in a non-semantic way is crossed in this form of presentation: where energetic manifestations take the place of \"meaning\", where the chasm of the loss of communication and the perversion of issues of meaning are intended evoke questions about power for the audience. Odermatt's theatre of rhythmic, alienated, choral voices and expressive physicality attempts to confront that which we never see on the surface of the theatre as portrayed in the media.\"\n\nStage design\nFor most of the theatre productions staged by Odermatt – especially the premieres – the Berlin stage designer Dirk Seesemann built the sets. He supports Odermatt's staging concepts \"with his minimalist austerity\" (Saarbrücker Zeitung, 21 November 2005).\n\nCriticism\nDieses. Kleine. Land.\n\"[Dieses. Kleine. Land.] ...is concerned with the (preservation) and against (integration) of small countries, the delusion of one-sided notions and the persecution of personal interests. As his means of portraying this, (...) he [Odermatt] employs the grotesque and occasionally drifts off into the absurd. The play represents a huge challenge for the actors as well as for the audience.\" (Benno von Skopnik, Welt kompakt, 22 November 2005).\n\"It is not only the play [Dieses. Kleine. Land.] that is deconstructed and reassembled, but also its characters and their language. Sentences collapse time and time again like a house of cards, and new façades are created from the rubble.. With Odermatt, everything turns into a quote within a quote, which explains why choruses of Schlager songs are sung, phrases are scratched like vinyl records and scenes (like those created specially by Gulden) function as a play-within-a-play.. As a result, speech develops that is by turns choral and concerted, where the voices in the dialogue cross each other and cut each other off. A deconstructivist procedure that mixes pantomime with slapstick and absurdist theatre with concrete poetry. For a long time, this tried and tested deconstructivist ritual captivated audiences just as it had done three years ago at the Saarbrücken premiere of Rolf Kemnitzer’s Die Bauchgeburt, and reveals the dialogue-like qualities of Gulden's play.\" (Christoph Schreiner, Saarbrücker Zeitung, 21 November 2005).\n\nDer böse Onkel\n\"Odermatt has looked around, and as an author has created a hybrid of Kroetzen's village tragedies with Ravenhill's beat-up Brit furore, then throws in Castorf's- savagery and splatter movie – an overloaded but polemical attempt. As an experienced director he has condensed his theatrical debut into a pacy example of the grotesque. Rather than descending into banal denunciation, in a host of excellently choreographed scenes, he conjures up deeply affecting dreamlike and nightmarish images onto the stage. As a result, in the play's best moments, all the controversial issues suddenly appear to be linked. The stage setting then proceeds to turn into a bizarre analysis of time, becoming a dark, glittering essay on sexuality and power.\" (Otto Paul Burkhardt: Liebst du mich? Ja, ich dich auch – Urs Odermatt inszeniert seinen Theatererstling als Furioso über Sexualität und Macht, Reutlinger Nachrichten, 29. April 2002).\n\nTrainspotting\n\"An absurd ballet rushes across the stage, cascades of words are layered over each other and fuse together with each other, often barely comprehensible, then into a forceful, insistent crescendo of staccatto: I am, I was, everything goes by so quickly!' Cascades of words with a directness that can barely be beaten, right through to faecal language and further into a highly artificial idiom, pushed too far by precisely placed stuttering or the echo-like repetition of individual words or parts of sentences.(...) Urs Odermatt’s staging is merciless in its immediacy, even more, even more open in its pacy choreography, which demands a huge presence from the ensemble cast dressed in rustling paper with printed pages from tabloid newspapers. Merciless in its physical proximity, which doesn’t required any nudity or exposure because the inner exposure is brought out into the open.\" (sda, 28 April 2005).\n\nCloser\n\"Men drop their trousers, women break through a huge vagina on a backdrop screen and out onto the stage. Deflowered from behind, the parted labia are flaunted right in the faces of the audience in Oldenburg. The premiere of Partick Marber’s Closer under the direction of Urs Odermatt lives up to its title and after the interval separated the theatregoers into those of a more delicate sensibility from those with a more open mind. The latter were clearly in the majority and greeted the end of the performance with huge applause.\" (Marijke Gerwin: Wie das Lotterleben so spielt – Sie fickten und sie schlugen sich, taz, 5.

    "title": "Digital audio workstation",
    "text": "A digital audio workstation (DAW ) is an electronic device or application software used for recording, editing and producing audio files. DAWs come in a wide variety of configurations, from a single software program on a laptop, to an integrated stand-alone unit, all the way to a highly complex configuration of numerous components controlled by a central computer. Regardless of configuration, modern DAWs have a central interface that allows the user to alter and mix multiple recordings and tracks into a final produced piece.\nDAWs are used for producing and recording music, songs, speech, radio, television, soundtracks, podcasts, sound effects and nearly every other kind of complex recorded audio.\n\nHistory\nEarly attempts at digital audio workstations in the 1970s and 1980s faced limitations such as the high price of storage and the vastly slower processing and disk speeds of the time.\nIn 1978, Soundstream, who had made one of the first commercially available digital audio tape recorders in 1977, built what could be considered the first digital audio workstation using some of the most current computer hardware of the time.  The Digital Editing System, as Soundstream called it, consisted of a DEC PDP-11/60 minicomputer running a custom software package called DAP (Digital Audio Processor), a Braegen 14\"-platter hard disk drive, a storage oscilloscope to display audio waveforms for editing, and a video display terminal for controlling the system. Interface cards that plugged into the PDP-11's Unibus slots (the Digital Audio Interface, or DAI) provided analog and digital audio input and output for interfacing to Soundstream's digital recorders and conventional analog tape recorders. The DAP software could perform edits to the audio recorded on the system's hard disks and produce simple effects such as crossfades.\nBy the late 1980s, a number of personal computers such as the Macintosh, Atari ST, and Amiga began to have enough power to handle digital audio editing.  Engineers used Macromedia's Soundedit, with Microdeal's Replay Professional and Digidesign's Sound Tools and Sound Designer to edit audio samples for sampling keyboards like the E-mu Emulator II and the Akai S900. Soon, people began to use them for simple two-track audio editing and audio mastering.\nIn 1989, Sonic Solutions released the first professional (48 kHz at 24 bit) disk-based non-linear audio editing system. The Macintosh IIfx-based Sonic System, based on research done earlier at George Lucas' Sprocket Systems, featured complete CD premastering, with integrated control of Sony's industry-standard U-matic tape-based digital audio editor.\nMany major recording studios switched over to using digital audio after Digidesign introduced its Pro Tools software in 1991, modeled after the traditional method and signal flow in most analog recording devices. At this time, most DAWs were Apple Mac based (e.g., Pro Tools, Studer Dyaxis, Sonic Solutions). Around 1992, the first Windows-based DAWs started to emerge from companies such as Innovative Quality Software (IQS) (now SAWStudio), Soundscape Digital Technology, SADiE, Echo Digital Audio, and Spectral Synthesis. All the systems at this point used dedicated hardware for their audio processing.\nIn 1992, Sunrize Industries released the AD516 soundcard for big-box Amiga computers. This allowed up to 8 tracks of 16-bit 48 kHz direct-to-disk recording and playback using its Studio 16 software. It could also integrate directly into Blue Ribbon Soundworks' Bars & Pipes Pro MIDI software or NewTek's Video Toaster, thus providing a complete package of MIDI sequencing and/or video synchronization with non-linear hard disk recording.\nIn 1993, the German company Steinberg released Cubase Audio on Atari Falcon 030. This version brought DSP built-in effects with 8-track audio recording and playback using only native hardware. The first Windows-based software-only product, introduced in 1993, was Samplitude (which already existed in 1992 as an audio editor for the Commodore Amiga).\n\nHardware\nIntegration\nAn integrated DAW consists of a digital signal processing, control surface, audio converters, and data storage in one device. Integrated DAWs were popular before commonly available personal computers became powerful enough to run DAW software. As personal computer power and speed increased and prices decreased, the popularity of costly integrated systems dropped.\n\nSoftware\nDAW can refer to the software itself, but traditionally, a computer-based DAW has four basic components: a computer, a sound card or other audio interface, audio editing software, and at least one user input device for adding or modifying data.  This could be as simple as a mouse and keyboard or as sophisticated as a piano-style MIDI controller keyboard or automated audio control surface for mixing track volumes.\nThe computer acts as a host for the sound card, while the software provides the interface and functionality for audio editing.  The sound card typically converts analog audio signals into a digital form, and digital back to analog audio when playing it back; it may also assist in further processing of the audio.  The software controls all related hardware components and provides a user interface to allow for recording, editing, and playback.\nComputer-based DAWs have extensive recording, editing, and playback capabilities (and some also have video-related features).  For example, they can provide a practically limitless number of tracks to record on, polyphony, and virtual synthesizers or sample-based instruments to use for recording music. DAWs can also provide a wide variety of effects, such as reverb, to enhance or change the sounds themselves.\nSimple smartphone-based DAWs, called mobile audio workstations (MAWs), are used (for example) by journalists for recording and editing on location.\nAs software systems, DAWs are designed with many user interfaces, but generally, they are based on a multitrack tape recorder metaphor, making it easier for recording engineers and musicians already familiar with using tape recorders to become familiar with the new systems. Therefore, computer-based DAWs tend to have a standard layout that includes transport controls (play, rewind, record, etc.), track controls and a mixer. A waveform display is another common feature.\nSingle-track DAWs display only one (mono or stereo form) track at a time. Multitrack DAWs support operations on multiple tracks at once. Like a mixing console, each track typically has controls that allow the user to adjust the gain, equalization and stereo panning of the sound on each track. In a traditional recording studio, additional rackmount processing gear is physically plugged into the audio signal path to add reverb, compression, etc. However, a DAW can also route in software or use audio plug-ins (for example, a VST plugin) to process the sound on a track.\nPerhaps the most significant feature available from a DAW that is not available in analog recording is the ability to undo a previous action, using a command similar to that of the undo function in word processing software.  Undo makes it much easier to avoid accidentally permanently erasing or recording over a previous recording.  If a mistake or unwanted change is made, the undo command is used to conveniently revert the changed data to a previous state.  Cut, Copy, Paste, and Undo are familiar and common computer commands and they are usually available in DAWs in some form. More common functions include the modifications of several factors concerning a sound. These include wave shape, pitch, tempo, and filtering.\nCommonly, DAWs feature some form of mix automation using procedural line segment-based or curve-based interactive graphs.  The lines and curves of the automation graph are joined by or comprise adjustable points.  By creating and adjusting multiple points along a waveform or control events, the user can specify parameters of the output over time (e.g., volume or pan).  Automation data may also be directly derived from human gestures recorded by a control surface or MIDI controller.\nMIDI recording, editing, and playback is increasingly incorporated into modern DAWs of all types, as is synchronization with other audio or video tools.\n\nThere are many free and open-source software programs that perform DAW functions. These are designed to run on a variety of operating systems and are usually developed non-commercially. Some of these include Ardour and LMMS.\nPersonal Composer, created by Jim Miller for Yamaha, was the star of the NAMM Show in 1983. Personal Composer runs under MS DOS 2.0 and includes a MIDI sequencer, synth editor (such as Yamaha's DX7), universal librarians and a score editor. The software was later released as Personal Composer System/2 (1988).\nIn 1996, Steinberg introduced a revamped Cubase (which was originally launched in 1989 as a MIDI sequencer for the Atari ST computer, later developed for Mac and Windows PC platforms, but had no audio capabilities until 1993's Cubase Audio) which could record and play back up to 32 tracks of digital audio on an Apple Macintosh without the need of any external DSP hardware. Cubase not only modeled a tape-like interface for recording and editing, but, in addition, using VST, also developed by Steinberg, modeled the entire mixing desk and effects rack common in analog studios. This revolutionized the DAW world, both in features and price tag, and was quickly imitated by most other contemporary DAW systems.\nDigital audio applications for Linux and BSD fostered technologies such as Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA), which drives audio hardware, and JACK Audio Connection Kit. JACK allows any JACK-aware audio software to connect to any other audio software running on the system, such as connecting an ALSA- or OSS-driven soundcard to a mixing and editing front-end, like Ardour or Rosegarden. In this way, JACK acts as a virtual audio patch bay, and it can be configured to use a computer's resources in real time, with dedicated memory, and with various options that minimize the DAW's latency. This kind of abstraction and configuration allows DJs to use multiple programs for editing and synthesizing audio streams, or multitasking and duplexing, without the need for analog conversion, or asynchronous saving and reloading files, and ensures a high level of audio fidelity.\nMembers of the Linux Audio Development (LAD) mailing list have contributed to the development of standards such as the LADSPA, DSSI and LV2 plugin architectures. The Virtual Studio Technology (VST) plugin standard is supported by some programs.\n\nPlug-ins\nThere are countless software plugins for DAW software, each one coming with its own unique functionality, thus expanding the overall variety of sounds and manipulations that are possible. Each has their own form of generating or manipulating sound, tone, pitch, and speed of a simple sound and transforming it into something different. To achieve an even more distinctive sound, multiple plugins can be used in layers and further automated to manipulate the original sounds.\n\nGenerative Audio Workstations\nRecent developments in generative artificial intelligence are spurring innovation in DAW software. A research paper from Georgia Tech, titled \"Composing with Generative Systems in the Digital Audio Workstation\", proposed the term Generative Audio Workstation to describe this emerging class of DAWs.\nThree examples of notable GAWs are AIVA, WavTool, and Symphony V. AIVA provides parameter-based AI MIDI song generation within a DAW. WavTool offers a browser DAW equipped with a GPT-4 composition assistant and AI text-to-sample generator. Symphony V provides generative vocal synthesis, note editing, and mixing tools.\nGenerative AI services have also become available through plugins that integrate with conventional DAWs, such as Izotope Neutron 4, TAIP, and Synthesizer V. Neutron 4 includes a mix assistant that uses machine learning to analyze audio and automatically apply processing effects. TAIP provides tape saturation powered by AI neural networks that imitate traditional DSP processing. Synthesizer V offers several AI vocalists whose notes can be manipulated.\nTo reduce the strain on computer memory, some plugin companies have developed thin client VSTs that use resources from a cloud server. For example, the audio-to-MIDI plugin Samplab offers a desktop application with user authentication and API calls that perform stem separation and MIDI transcription off of the computer's local device. This can improve load speeds or prevent applications from crashing.\n\nImpact\nDAWs can be implemented in a music education class to show students how to use them and learn how to produce their own music. According to a study done by the Indonesia University of Education, the use of a DAW in music learning can let students build their learning of music production on their own. Another study done by the University of Milan made a DAW accessible to kids.\nThe usage of DAW can be found in most hip hop and EDM music with the use of looping an instrumental. With music production also moving to a laptop, music making has shifted from professional studios and into bedrooms.\n\nNotable examples\nSee also\nAudio restoration – Removal of imperfections from recorded sound\nBroadcast automation – Systems that can run a broadcast facility in the absence of a human operator\nComparison of digital audio editors\nComparison of MIDI editors and sequencers\nList of free software for audio\nList of music software\nMusic tracker – Type of software for creating music\nMusic workstation – Device for composing electronic music\nRadio software\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nA list of software DAWs, Sequencers, Hosts, etc.\nDAW Software for beginners",

    "text": "The Wagon and the Star (or The Waggon and the Star) is a 1936 New Zealand film by producer and director J.J.W. Pollard, who also wrote the screenplay. Only one reel of the film and some out-takes survived and is considered lost film by Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision. The handbuilt camera used was built by Ted Coubray and \"confiscated\" by Alexander Markey on the set of Hei Tiki.\nThe Wagon and the Star was the first sound feature film to be made in Southland. The film included two original songs, for which Pollard wrote the words and a local composer, Howard Moody, the music.\n\nPremise\nTwo migrants from \"Home\", John Hawthron and Andy Henderson from Scotland, meet on a road building gang.  John has not yet made his fortune in the new country, but he eventually builds up a large transport and accommodation business and marries Mary, the daughter of a local landowner, despite the presence of a villainous local lawyer.\n\nCast\nMost of the cast were amateurs from the local operatic society in Invercargill.\nJohn Peake as John Hawthron\nFaye Hinchey as Mary Tyson\nWilliam Buchan as Andy Henderson\nTR Vanity (Tom Pryde) as Hubert Throstle, the lawyer\nMoira O'Neill as Anne\nRichard Grenfell as the landowner\nMary MacEwan as Mary's aunt\n\nReception\nThe film had its premiere in Invercargill in July 1936. The Southland Times reported enthusiastically the next day: \"The story is a slight one, but it is well-connected, more logical than those of most screen scenarists, and is admirably suited for conveying, without over-emphasis, the fact that Southland is a place of beauty.\"\n\nReferences\nNew Zealand Film 1912-1996 by Helen Martin & Sam Edwards p48 (1997, Oxford University Press, Auckland) ISBN 019 558336 1\n\nExternal links\nThe Wagon and the Star at Nga Taonga (with video extract)",

    "text": "Yuto Shinohara (Japanese: 篠原悠人, Shinohara Yuto; born May 15, 1998) is a Japanese kickboxer, currently competing in the lightweight division of K-1. A professional competitor since 2014, he is the former Krush Super Lightweight champion and a one-time Krush Lightweight title challenger.\nAs of January 2023, he is the #9 ranked featherweight kickboxer in the world according to Beyond Kick. Combat Press ranked him as a top ten super bantamweight between March and May 2022, and as a top ten bantamweight between February 2019 and June 2020.\n\nKickboxing career\nSuper lightweight\nCareer beginnings\nShinohara made his professional debut against Tasuku Kido at HOOST CUP KINGS WEST on November 16, 2014. He won the fight by a first-round knockout. Shinohara faced Shinichiro Kawasaki a month later, at DEEP KICK 23 on December 21, 2014. He won the fight by unanimous decision. After notching his first two professional wins, Shinohara returned to amateur competition, in order to take part in the K-1 Koshien 2015 Tournament. He won the Koshien title with a third-round knockout of Kensei Kondo at K-1 World GP 2015 The Championship on November 21, 2015.\nHis spotless professional record and the Koshien tournament win, led to Shihonara being signed by K-1. He made his debut with the organization against Yuki Koge at K-1 World GP 2016 -60kg Japan Tournament on April 24, 2016. He won the fight by a second-round knockout, stopping Koge with a flurry of punches at the 1:15 minute mark.\nShinohara next made his debut with K-1's sister organization Krush, as he was booked to face Daiki Matsushita at Krush.67 on July 18, 2016. Matsushita won the fight by a second-round knockout, handing Shinohara both his first professional loss and his first stoppage loss. Shinohara next faced Tatsuya Mineyama at K-1 World GP 2016 Featherweight Championship Tournament on November 3, 2016. He won the fight by unanimous decision, with all three judges scoring the bout 30–27 in his favor.\nAfter successfully rebounding from his loss to Matsushita, Shinohara took part in the Krush Super Lightweight tournament, held to crown the new champion as Hideaki Yamazaki was stripped of the title due to injuries. He was booked to face Jun Nakazawa in the tournament semifinals, which were held at Krush.73 on February 18, 2017. He lost the fight by a second-round knockout. Shinohara was first knocked down with a left hook midway through the round, and was knocked out with a second left hook soon afterwards.\n\nTitle run\nShinohara faced Kensei Kondo Krush.79 ～in NAGOYA～ on August 20, 2017. The two previously fought in the finals of the 2015 K-1 Koshien tournament, with Shinohara winning by a third-round knockout. He was proved to be the better fighter in their second meeting as well, winning the fight by a second-round knockout.\nShinohara faced FUMIYA at KHAOS.4 on October 14, 2017, representing Kansai in a \"Kantō vs Kansai 6 versus 6\" themed event. He won the fight by a third-round knockout, stopping FUMIYA with a right cross a minute into the round. Shinohara was furthermore awarded the MVP prize as well, as the best fighter of the event.\nFollowing a split decision victory against Hayato Suzuki at K-1 WORLD GP 2017 JAPAN ～SURVIVAL WARS 2017～ on December 27, 2017, Shinohara returned to Krush to face Takaki Hosogoe at Krush.86 on March 11, 2018. He won the fight by unanimous decision, with all three judges awarding him a 30–27 scorecard.\nShinohara was booked to face FUMIYA at Krush.88 on May 17, 2018. The pair had fought just seven months prior, with Shinohara winning by a third-round knockout. He won the rematch in the same manner, forcing a referee stoppage at the 1:50 minute mark, after having knocked FUMIYA down twice with left hooks.\n\nKrush super lightweight champion\nShinohara vs. Nakazawa\nAt a press conference held by Krush on June 28, 2018, it was announced that Shinohara would challenge the reigning Krush Super Lightweight champion Jun Nakazawa, in what was Nakazawa's second title defense. The bout was scheduled as the co-main event of Krush.91, which was held on August 5, 2018. He won the closely contested fight by split decision. Two of the judges scored the fight 30–29 in his favor, while the third judge scored the fight 30–29 for Nakazawa. Shinohara stated his desire to move down to lightweight (62.5 kg) in his post-fight interview, as he felt at a weight disadvantage at super lightweight.\n\nK-1 Lightweight Grand Prix\nOn October 20, 2018, K-1 announced they would hold a Lightweight Grand Prix at K-1 World GP 2018: K-1 Lightweight World's Strongest Tournament on December 8, 2018. Shinohara was booked to face the reigning Krush Lightweight champion Kongnapa Weerasakreck in the tournament quarterfinals. Shinohara knocked Kongnapa with a left hook early in the first round, and although he was able to beat the ten count, Shinohara knocked down him a second time with another left hook soon after. These two knockdowns awarded Shinohara an automatic technical knockout victory under the K-1 tournament rules. He needed just 25 seconds to advance to the next round.\nShinohara advanced to the tournament semifinals, where he faced Kenta Hayashi. Hayashi first knocked Shinohara down with a right hook, before stopping him with a right cross at the 2:31 minute mark of the first-round. Ten days later, on December 18, Shinohara vacated the Krush super lightweight title.\n\nMove to lightweight\nShinohara faced the 2018 K-1 Lightweight Grand Prix finalist Fumiya Osawa at K-1 World GP 2019: K'FESTA 2 on March 10, 2019. The fight was judged a unanimous decision draw after the first three rounds, with scores of 29–29, 29–29 and 30–30. Accordingly, an extra round was contested, after which Shinohara was awarded the unanimous decision.\nShinohara faced Shinichiro Kawasaki at K-1 World GP 2019: Japan vs World 5 vs 5 & Special Superfight in Osaka on August 24, 2019. The pair previously fought at DEEP KICK 23 on December 21, 2014, with Shinohara winning by unanimous decision. He won the rematch in the same manner, with all three judges scoring the fight 28–26 in his favor. Shinohara was knocked down with a left hook at the 2:02 minute mark of the second round, but was able to knock Kawasaki down twice before the end of the round himself.\nShinohara was rewarded with this two-fight winning streak with the chance to challenge the reigning Krush Lightweight champion Kongnapa Weerasakreck, in the main event of Krush.113 on June 28, 2020. He lost the fight by unanimous decision. Two of the judges scored the fight 30–28 for Kongnapa, while the third judge awarded Kongnapa a 30–29 scorecard.\nShinohara faced the former two-weight K-1 champion Koya Urabe at K-1 World GP 2020 in Osaka on September 22, 2020. Urabe won the fight by unanimous decision, after an extra fourth round was fought.\nShinohara was expected to face the former Krush Super Featherweight champion Yuma Saikyo at K-1: K’Festa 4 on January 24, 2021.

    "title": "Château de Montignac",
    "text": "The Château de Montignac is a ruined castle in the commune of Montignac-Charente, in the Charente département of France. The castle is the property of the commune and has been listed since 1962 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture.\n\nHistory\nA fortified camp existed at Montignac in the 9th century, during the Norman invasions. The castle is located at the crossroads of two important roads, the Via Agrippa from Saintes to Lyon where it crosses the Charente, and Via Chaussada from Périgueux to Poitiers.\nThe castle was built and rebuilt several times in the 12th and 13th centuries. It was then a fief of the bishop of Angoulême. William II of Angoulême obtained from the bishop of Angoulême, the fief and right to build a castle, with the stones of the Andone Castrum.\nIn the 12th century, ownership of the castle was disputed between Gerard de Blaye, helped by the lords of Saintonge and Poitou, and Vulgrain II of Angouleme, supported by the Duke of Aquitaine. The latter was able to resume building and in 1140 he built the square keep and the walled enclosure. The round towers dates to the 13th century. Renaud II, Lord of Pons, held the castle of Montignac, in the right of his wife Marguerite, lady of Montignac, the only child and heiress of Taleyrand, Lord of Montignac.\nMontignac passed to the Lusignan family in 1218, when Hugh X of Lusignan asserted the right to the castle of his wife, Isabella, heiress of Angoulême. In 1243, he bequeathed the castle to his son, Guillaume de Lusignan.\nIn 1350, it was in the hands of Pierre II d'Amboise, viscount of Thouars, before being bought by the La Rochefoucauld family on 13 January 1399. Montignac became a barony in the 15th century and was preserved by the La Rochefoucaulds until the French Revolution. The remains of the castle were dismantled around 1840 and the chapel dedicated to Saint-Marie was destroyed between 1940 and 1950.\n\nArchitecture\nOf the enceinte, there remain the gateway with a portcullis and two round towers on top of an escarpment, the western part of the enceinte and a round tower.\nThe present fairground corresponds to the lower courtyard.\nA 13th-century watercolour shows that there were also two towers covered by \"pepperpots\".  \nThe priory of Saint Étienne, dating from 1030, was demolished in 1960 and its stones were partly used to rebuild the keep. The latter forms an imposing structure from which the view extends across the valley of the Charente.\n\nSee also\nList of castles in France\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nBase Mérimée: Château, Ministère français de la Culture.

    "text": "Nicholas (I) Vásári (Hungarian: Vásári (I.) Miklós; died between 1320 and 1333) was a Hungarian nobleman at the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries, who served as Vice-voivode of Transylvania from 1319 to 1320.\n\nLife\nHis father was Roland Szügyi, a landowner in Nógrád County, who is mentioned by a single source in 1255. Roland later moved to Vásári in Bihar County. Nicholas first appears in contemporary records in March 1295 alongside his two brothers Gregory (fl. 1295–1327) and Lawrence (fl. 1295), when they were involved in a lawsuit over the determination of boundaries of their inherited land Vásári, and reached an agreement with their neighbor comes Peter Ajkai.\nHis early life and possible involvement in the clashes of the so-called feudal anarchy following the extinction of the Árpád dynasty is uncertain. He became a familiaris of the powerful military leader Dózsa Debreceni, an important and loyal soldier of Charles I of Hungary. After defeating the rebellious Borsa clan, Debreceni became lord of Bihar, Vásári's homeland. It is presumable he entered to his service thereafter. Vásári was appointed vice-voivode of Transylvania sometimes around August 1319, when his lord functioned as voivode of the province. Vásári held his dignity at least until 1 March 1320. He was replaced by Achilles Torockói by May 1321.\nNicholas I Vásári married an unidentified sister of Csanád Telegdi, the Archbishop of Esztergom from 1330 to 1349. Their marriage produced several children: his namesake son, Nicholas II himself was also an archbishop of Esztergom. His second son, John was a courtly knight in 1344, while Thomas served as ispán of Somogy County in 1371, but some sources also refer to him as Ban of Croatia in 1367. Nicholas' youngest son Beke was ispán of Aranyos Seat in 1344. Vásári also had two unidentified daughters, who married Stephen Vajdai and Ladislaus N, respectively. Nicholas Vásári, Sr. died sometimes between 1320 and 1333.\n\nReferences\n\n\n== Sources ==",

    "title": "The Photographers' Gallery and Workshop",
    "text": "The Photographers' Gallery and Workshop (1973–2010) was an Australian photography gallery established in South Yarra, Melbourne, and which ran almost continuously for nearly 40 years. Its representation, in the 1970s and 1980s, of contemporary and mid-century, mostly American and some European original fine prints from major artists was influential on Australian audiences and practitioners, while a selection of the latter's work sympathetic to the gallery ethos was shown alternately and then dominated the program.\n\nOther uses\nAn unrelated space also called \"The Photographers' Gallery\" ran for three years from 1989–1992 in Brisbane; another, the Photographer's Gallery [sic], was operating in Sydney in the c.1993-2000s at 96 Reserve Road, Artarmon,; and the 2006 Head-On Portrait Prize Exhibition was held in Balmain, also in Sydney at a short-lived venue called \"The Photographers Gallery\".\n\nHistory\nPaul Cox, Ingeborg Tyssen, John F. Williams and Rod McNicol founded The Photographers' Gallery and Workshop in 1973 at 344 Punt Road, South Yarra in an 1888 two-storey fruiterer's shop and dwelling (originally a bootmaker's) in the 'Sharp's Buildings' terrace, rented since 1965 as a photographer's studio and accommodation by Paul Cox, who from 1969–c.1980 taught cinematography at Prahran College.\nIt was the second gallery devoted to photography to be established in the city after Rennie Ellis' and Robert Ashton's Brummels Gallery, which was started in 1972 less than a kilometre away, and before the Church Street Photography Centre run by Joyce Evans in neighbouring Richmond (1976).\n\nGallery\nIan Lobb, an Australian born in 1948, who had undertaken workshops with Ansel Adams and Paul Caponigro, took over the Gallery in late 1974. Also that year, Lobb was teaching photography at Coburg Technical School with Carol Jerrems, and they met American Bill Heimerman (born 13 January 1950) who was teaching English at the same institution and was renting rooms above the gallery; the two inspired Heimerman's interest in photography. Lobb mounted his first exhibition as director at the beginning of 1975. He and Heimerman became co-directors of the gallery from the beginning of 1976. Beside some government funding and sales, both financially supported their roles through teaching, Heimerman being next employed at Brighton Technical College, where he and other staff members established a photography program, and then at the Council of Adult Education. Critic and photography lecturer Tony Perry noted Heimerman's 'detached, informed view of photography'.\nLobb and Heimerman showed some local work but, as Helen Ennis notes; \"imported exhibitions of fine art photography by Paul Caponigro, William Clift, Emmet Gowin and other American\" and some European, photographers for exhibitions. The first exhibition of international photography at the gallery was that of Paul Caponigro in 1975 which sold 22 prints, after which success the gallery was closed for renovations, during which time Heimerman made a trip to the US to secure more shows. After the refurbishment Melbourne Times critic Wendy Harmer described the space as \"an oasis of pristine white walls and warm, polished wood.\n\nWorkshop\nAs well as exhibitions, and from the outset, workshops were held in the gallery building from which part of the funding for the enterprise was derived. The two floors of the terrace building accommodated a two-person darkroom available for film development and printing, and a demonstration room with 6-8 student capacity. Printing for exhibitions was offered. Technical instruction for beginners and in the Zone System for those more advanced was provided at first by Australian photographer Steven Lojewski in 1976. Evening classes ran for ten weeks. By 1977 Heimerman and Lobb had organised the first workshop to be conducted in Australia by an American photographer, Ralph Gibson, and sponsored another, of 6 days by William Clift in May 1978 (costing participants $200), before Lobb left to pursue his own photography later that year. Jeff Busby, who also exhibited at the gallery, took over later as Heimerman's assistant.\nAmong the more recent workshops was 'How Joshua Greene Saved Marilyn Monroe: Techniques to Rehabilitate Ageing Photographs and the Art of Digital Printing', held on 26 November 2002 by the son of  Milton H. Greene who photographed Monroe.\nIn addition to its activities at its own premises was the Gallery's organisation and sponsorship of seminars by international photographers, which began with Ralph Gibson's on 11 August 1977 at Prahran College, then that of Harry Callahan, held on 20 November 1979 at the Prahran Recreational Centre, 147 High Street with also a workshop at the Gallery.\n\nEthos\nBy showcasing the silver gelatin 'fine print'  Lobb and Heimerman hoped to improve Australian work by example, as Lobb observed,\n\n\"From 1975, every second show was an international show [. . .] The initial philosophy was simply to let people see the physical difference between the production of prints overseas and locally.\"\nIn 1981 however, The Age newspaper listed the gallery's aims as being;\n\n\"to show international photography as well as supporting young Australians who are exploring new areas of creative and conceptual photography.\n\nReception\nCurator Joyce Agee in 1988 noted that, with feminist photography on the ascendant, the gallery's ambitions irritated some Australian women photographers;\n\nIn the 1970s, Micky Allan, the late Carol Jerrems, Ruth Maddison, Sue Ford and Ponch Hawkes, reacting against the technocratic and patriarchal American West Coast 'fine print' tradition then being promoted by The Photographers' Gallery in Melbourne, began to use photography as an intimate expression of their individual concerns.\nNevertheless, Jerrems was amongst the first exhibitors at the Gallery, showing there four times before her premature death in 1980. Noted women's activist Beatrice Faust, who reviewed many of the gallery's shows from 1976-88 in The Age newspaper, was supportive in her critiques, and in September 1987 hosted  the show Beatrice Faust Curates: From Boubat to Fereday at the gallery featuring male and female photographers.\nCertainly women exhibiting were outnumbered by men in a ratio of nearly 10:1 until the 90s, after which they appear on a more equal footing (see below).\nThe Gallery's concentration on American photography in its early years was not in isolation and was prompted as much by interest in international photography amongst Australians as by Heimerman's own contacts in the US, and paralleled international touring exhibitions of Bill Brandt in 1971, and the French Foreign Ministry's major exhibition of Henri Cartier-Bresson in 1974. Joyce Evans' Church Street also presented work by American's Minor White, Jerry Uelsmann, Les Krims and others.\nIn mid-1978, the gallery extended a call in the pages of the magazine Light Vision to Australian photographers to submit work for a survey that was to be a traveling exhibition. The final selection, featured in the journal in a double number, 6 and 7, titled 'Special Australian Edition', issued October 1978 with two samples across double-page spreads of each of 21 photographers, many represented and selected by the Photographers Gallery, among them a number who were also 'Correspondents' for Light Vision at the time. Editor Jean-Marc Le Pechoux acknowledged the cooperative nature of the venture in his editorial, and in her introduction art historian and critic Memory Holloway emphasised the breadth of the selection; \"...a plurality of techniques, ideologies and styles; social documentary; pictorial, surreal landscapes; nudes; portraits; straight photography.\" Four of the 21 contributors were women, but the exercise marked a shift in the program toward a gender-inclusive representation of Australian photographers of diverse styles and often radical attitudes to picture-making and photographic printing and presentation.\nTony Perry, who reviewed shows there 1978-80, was complimentary of contributions by William Heimermann and the 'Photographers Gallery' to Australian Photography in his article 'Australia: looking for a photographic identity', as was Peter Turner's interview with Paul Cox in Light Vision.\nIn 1981, The Age newspaper critic Geoff Strong, in reporting on the imminent closure of Joyce Evans' Church Street gallery, noted that The Photographers' Gallery was also facing tough times during a recession, rising unemployment and a general downturn in the fortunes of art galleries;\n\n\"Across the river in Punt Rd., South Yarra, Bill Heimerman sits in a back room of his Photographers' Gallery. He has just mounted an exhibition from the Dutch surrealist photographer Paul De Nooijer but it remains in darkness five days a week because he says, he cannot afford the electricity bills. He says his phone had been disconnected and he is looking for a job as a night janitor or a checkout operator in a Seven-Eleven store so he can pay the rent and keep the place open.\"\nThe status and purpose of the Photographers' Gallery over its long tenure continued to evolve. Critic Beatrice Faust, a supporter of the gallery since its inception, in The Age in January 1990 observed;\n\n\"For several years now, Artist's Space has taken over the role established by the Photographers' Gallery; to provide a space for the exhibition of photographers' photographs–as distinct from the painterly kind.\"\nNevertheless, the Gallery was to survive for another twenty years.\n\nClosure\nThe gallery was closed in 2010 and sold in 2015, and after a period of failing health, Bill Heimerman died on 1 October 2017. Ian Lobb died 1 October 2023.\n\nLegacy\nIn the 1970s, with the decline of the pictorial magazines and a consequent crisis in photojournalism and documentary photography, a revival of the pre-WW2 interest in photography as a fine art was a world-wide phenomenon, as it was in Australia. In 1972, Beatrice Faust, in reviewing Two Views of Erotica: Henry Talbot/Carol Jerrems at Brummels Gallery in Nation Review urged;\n\n\"There is no reason why photographs cannot be sold like prints, in numbered editions, and the trend to do this is worldwide. New York's Museum of Modern Art has had a section for photographic art for years, and a couple of these have found their way to Melbourne's National Gallery, which is the only one in Australia to have a department of photography.\nThe Photographers' Gallery and Workshop, because of its policy of sourcing and promoting established international work of a high standard, was well placed when percipient private collectors were entering the market in fine photographic prints, and major Australian institutions were initiating collections of photography.\nThe inaugural curator of the new photography department Jennie Boddington at the newly (1968) re-housed National Gallery of Victoria; Alison Carroll and Ian North of the Art Gallery of South Australia (which had begun to collect photography as a distinct discipline from the mid-1920s, its building expanded in 1962, refurbished 1979); and David Moore and Wes Stacey at the Australian Centre for Photography (est. 1973); all purchased from the Photographers' Gallery, with special interest in American and European works, along with the National Gallery of Australia, which though not built and opened until 1982, had started a photography collection in 1972. Its director James Mollison turned the sponsorship of the tobacco company Philip Morris International to the acquisition of Australian photography. These sales contributed significantly to the standing and survival of the Gallery, particularly in its early years of the 1970s and 1980s.\nAn archive of The Photographers' Gallery and Workshop is maintained by Heimerman's partner, Barbara Derrick.\n\nExhibitions\nThe Gallery under the management of Cox, Williams, McNicol and Thyssen held exhibitions including\n\nOther solo or group exhibitions at the Gallery presented photographers Paul Hopper and Ingeborg Tyssen. In 1982 The Photographers' Gallery presented Aaron Siskind at Reconnaissance in Fitzroy in a joint venture.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "Jericho, New York",
    "text": "Jericho  is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in the Town of Oyster Bay in Nassau County, on the North Shore of Long Island, in New York, United States, approximately 29 miles (47 km) east of Midtown Manhattan. The population was 14,808 at the time of the 2020 census.\nThe area is served by the Jericho Union Free and the Syosset Central School Districts, the boundaries of which differ somewhat from those of the hamlet. The boundaries of the Jericho Post Office vary from both the hamlet and the school district boundaries, including a portion of Jericho in the Westbury ZIP code and a portion of Syosset in the Jericho ZIP code.\n\nHistory\nLocated in the Town of Oyster Bay, Jericho was part of the Robert Williams Plantation in 1648. The English families who settled in Jericho were, or soon became, Quakers, members of the Society of Friends. Many fled from persecution in England and in the New England Colonies. They sought a peaceful existence as farmers. The name of the area was changed in 1692 from Lusum to Jericho after the town in the Middle East near the Jordan River mentioned in the Bible as part of the Promised Land.\nThe Census of slaves, conducted in the Province of New York in 1755, contains a long list of enslaved individuals in Oyster Bay, including the hamlets of Jericho and what is now North Hempstead. It is followed by a remarkable additional list of \"free Negroes Melattoes [people of Afro-European ancestry] and Mustees [people of Afro-Indigenous ancestry] Resideing within ye Township of Oysterbay that may probably Be Likely In case of Insurrections To be as Mischevious as ye Slaves.\" (Free individuals were not supposed to be reported for the Census; a local militia captain supplied it on his own initiative, with the expectation \"that ye Other Captains in Oysterbay will acquaint Your Honour [governor of New York] of those Resideing in ye Other parts of ye Township.\")\nDuring the Revolutionary War, the British occupation of Long Island brought hardship to local Quakers; they were compelled to board soldiers in their homes even as they maintained their pacifist stance. Once peace returned, Jericho flourished again. A Quaker school was built in 1793, and the Charity Society of Jericho and Westbury was established in 1794. The Friends Meeting House, built in 1788, still stands and is still in use in the 21st century. Slavery was abolished locally in 1817, with the help of Elias Hicks. (A Hempstead carpenter, Hicks had moved to his wife’s family's farm in Jericho in 1771, where he became a noted preacher of Quaker doctrine.)\n\nA post office was established in 1802, a cider mill in the mid-19th century, and the first public elementary school (known as the Cedar Swamp School)  in 1905. Improvements to infrastructure were made with the founding of the Jericho Water District in 1923. As the population increased, a Volunteer Fire Department established in 1938, and a new elementary school was built in 1953 (Robert Seaman School). The population kept increasing until the last elementary schools in Jericho were built, the George A. Jackson Elementary School in 1957, the now closed Robert Williams School in 1961 and the Cantiague School in 1963.\nAfter World War II, in the 1950s Phebe Underhill Seaman sold a large piece of her land to real estate developers. This property was developed for new suburban housing. The water tower was erected in 1952. In 1958 the NY Department of Transportation demolished \"Old Jericho\" to widen Broadway, Routes 106/107, and to put in a cloverleaf access to Jericho Turnpike. New grade schools and a high school were added to the community along with a shopping center, a new post office, new fire department and a public library.\nAlso in Jericho is the New York Community Bank Theatre, originally established in 1956 as the Westbury Music Fair. The main entrance to SUNY Old Westbury is located in Jericho.\n\nUnderground Railroad\nThe building now known as One North was built in 1789 as the home for the prominent Quaker and abolitionist Valentine Hicks, his wife Abigail, and their children. Hicks' father-in-law Elias Hicks \"had been the spark that helped convince Quakers and other like-minded people after the Revolutionary War that all men were created equal—including people of color who were enslaved\". Valentine Hicks was also an Underground Railroad station master; in his home—a key way station—a removable panel behind an upstairs linen closet (that is still there today) concealed a staircase to the attic where Hicks hid runaways until the coast was clear.  The Town of Oyster Bay designated the site as a historic town landmark in 2012. In 2015 partial demolition of the Maine Maid Inn took place without the approval of the Oyster Bay landmark commission, which outraged many preservationists.\n\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 4.1 square miles (11 km2), all land.\nThere is another community known as Jericho in New York, located in the extreme northern corner of the state, in the Town of Altona, Clinton County.\n\nClimate\nUnder the Köppen climate classification, Jericho lies in the transition zone between a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) and a hot-summer humid continental climate (Dfa). As such, summers are usually hot and humid with occasional thunderstorms, winters are usually cool with snow and rain, and the spring and fall typically feature mild weather.\nThe average monthly temperatures in the hamlet range from 30.9 °F in January to 74.7 °F in July. The local hardiness zone is 7a.\n\nGreater Jericho area\nJericho consists of three villages and one unincorporated hamlet:\n\nJericho\nBrookville\nUpper Brookville\nOld Brookville\nOld Brookville is also part of the greater Glen Cove Area.\n\nDemographics\nAt the 2000 census there were 13,045 people in 4,545 households, including 3,813 families, in the CDP. The population density was 3,214.1 inhabitants per square mile (1,241.0/km2). There were 4,600 housing units at an average density of 1,133.4 per square mile (437.6/km2). The racial makeup of the CDP was 86.36% White, 10.69% Asian, 1.42% African American, 0.03% Native American,  0.01% Pacific Islander, 0.51% from other races, and 0.98% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino residents of any race were 2.44%.\nJericho, like many other places in northern Nassau County, has historically had a large Jewish population. During the 2010s, Jericho saw an influx of residents of East Asian background, drawn by its prestigious public school district and high quality of life. As a result, the racial makeup of the CDP by 2020 had shifted considerably, to 48.1% White, 46.5% Asian, 1% African American, and 3% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino residents of any race made up 2.5% of the population. In 2020, Asians made up nearly 70% of students in Jericho Union Free School District, up from 33% in 2010.\n\nOf the 4,545 households 38.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 74.8% were married couples living together, 7.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 16.1% were non-families. 13.7% of households were one person and 6.1% were one person aged 65 or older. The average household size was 2.81 and the average family size was 3.08.\nThe age distribution was 25.3% under the age of 18, 4.6% from 18 to 24, 25.4% from 25 to 44, 28.4% from 45 to 64, and 16.4% 65 or older. The median age was 42 years. For every 100 females, there were 94.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 90.2 males.\nThe median household income was $171,743 and the median family income  was $239,626. The per capita income for the CDP was $76,646. About 2.7% of families and 4.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 4.8% of those under age 18 and 5.2% of those age 65 or over.\n\nEconomy\nAer Lingus, the flag carrier of Ireland, operates its U.S. office in Jericho. Nathan's Famous is headquartered in Wing A of the second floor of One Jericho Plaza, in Jericho.\nPublishers Clearing House moved its headquarters to Jericho in 2017.\nNationwide TFS, the top provider of personal payment solutions for Chapter 13, was founded in Jericho in 2011.\nMany retail and industrial businesses operate along Cantiague Rock Road in the Jericho Gardens section of the CDP.\nAs of 2024, the average home price in Jericho was $1,083,413, compared to a New York state average of $453,138; the average listing price for a home was $1,276,833, compared to a New York state average of $406,667. Jericho home prices tend to be extremely high relative to their size or quality, due to the strong desire of many homebuyers to reside in homes zoned for the nationally renowned Jericho Union Free School District. Homes located within the boundaries of the Jericho school district are often several hundreds of thousands of dollars more expensive than similarly sized homes located just outside it.\n\nNotable people\n\nTyler Alvarez, actor\nMadison Beer, singer\nDavid Carol, photographer\nHarry Chapin, singer/songwriter/storyteller (had a fatal automobile accident in Jericho)\nJordan Cila, soccer player\nAdam Felber, author, radio personality\nAdam Fox, professional ice hockey defenseman and Norris Trophy winner for the New York Rangers of the National Hockey League\nStephanie Klein, writer\nDonny Lia, racing driver\nMatt Litwin, musician, founder of band Bulletproof Messenger\nHoward Lutnick, businessman and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald and United States Secretary of Commerce\nPH-1, rapper\nNatalie Portman, actress\nMiroslav Šatan, retired professional hockey player\nJay Sekulow, attorney and presidential advisor\nAdrienne Shelly, actress\nJamie-Lynn Sigler, who played Meadow Soprano on the HBO series The Sopranos.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "Potash works",
    "text": "A potash works (German: Aschenhaus, Aschenhütte or Potaschhütte) was a subsidiary operation of a glassworks in the Early Modern Period. The latter needed potash, as well as quartz and lime as raw materials for the manufacture of glass. Potash acted as a flux in the production process, that is by mixing it with quartz sand it significantly reduced the melting point of the latter. To make potash the glassworks built potash huts or works in the vicinity, in which wood ash and vegetable ash was gathered by ash burners and initially washed in water and then vaporized; the whole process being known as leaching.\nContemporary witness, teacher and local historian, Lukas Grünenwald, recorded the recollections from his youth in Dernbach in the Palatinate region:\n\nThese potash huts were small, rectangular stone houses with a parlour and kitchen and a wood store above them. In the corner of the kitchen a large, round iron cauldron used for potash boiling stood on the brick stove and a chimney rose from there up to the gabled roof. In the three walls opposite the entrance were small windows.  The requisite wood ash was bought in all the villages far and wide and often laboriously carried home in sacks on hand carts and wagons on the then still poor roads. In the hut the ashes were first stored cold in grey wicker baskets, lined with linen, and stood on top of leaching vats. Water was poured over the ashes and they were thoroughly soaked until they were completely leached.  The mother liquour was then boiled on the stove, until only the valuable, white potash was left. This was sold for a high price to the glassworks.\nThe consumption of wood in the process of making potash was extremely high, which is why the glassworks were frequently established in areas of extensive forest (hence the term forest glass). For example, the documents of the forest glassworks of Spiegelberg in the Swabian-Franconian Forest, which was in operation from 1705 to 1822, had an annual demand for potash of approximately 800 centners. Because one cubic metre of wood (750 kg) only produced 1 kg of potash, this glassworks thus needed around 40,000 cubic metres of wood per year.\nEven today the names of some settlements still recall the former potash works. For example, two hamlets in the municipality of Mainhardt, Germany, are called Aschenhütte.\n\nReferences\nLiterature\nMarianne Hasenmayer: Die Glashütten im Mainhardter Wald und in den Löwensteiner Bergen.

    "text": "\"Smokin' Hot\" is the 14th episode of the fourth season of the American comedy-drama series, Ugly Betty, and the  79th episode overall. It originally aired on ABC in the United States on February 10, 2010.\n\nPlot\nIt is Fashion Week at Mode and Daniel helps Betty cover a low-priority show, this after Betty is singled out by Wilhelmina, who then gives her something else to do a story on, like the history of the sewing machine. However, thanks to a malfunction in Daniel's new Bluetooth headset that recorded a conversation between Daniel and Wilhelmina about Betty that later shows up on Betty's cellphone, Betty ends up giving Daniel the cold shoulder at work but she forgives him.\nBetty discovers a new designer called Marisa, and decides to help promote her as one of the 10 Designers to Watch, however she faces stiff competition from Marc, who gives her tips on how to pitch the designer to Wilhelmina. During the pitching, Marc does the talking while Betty plays Vanna White, but after winning over Wilhelmina, Marc ends up getting all the credit instead of Betty, leaving her furious with him for failing to give her credit. Amanda, jealous of Betty and Marc moving up in the world, teams up with Helen to create a new clothing line to make the list, but struggles to persuade Marc and Betty to lobby Wilhelmina on her behalf. Both Marc and Betty agree that even though Amanda and Helen have great ideas, they cannot pitch the idea to Wilhelmina and come clean to an upset Amanda.\nDaniel gets seduced into male modeling, which is spurred on by Wilhelmina who hopes to add more male models to the event after several of the females bail out. Claire's (Judith Light) son, Tyler, arrives in New York to find his mother, only to get sidetracked by Wilhelmina, who mistakes him for a male model and makes him part of the show, where he becomes the reason for Daniel's attempts to try to become a model. Daniel tries his best to walk, talk and act like a model, but realizes that at his age and with his excess weight that he is not cut out to be a model and opts out of the event.\nAt the Suarez home, Ignacio brings home a huge chandelier from the restaurant, which seems to have problems, and Hilda tells Bobby she wishes her salon would be struck by lightning, so she can use the insurance money. However, just as Betty comes home later that afternoon, Marisa, feeling nervous about the event, asks Betty if she can leave her designs at the place. This is later followed by Amanda, who stops by that evening to apologize to Betty. When Marisa stops by to tell Betty that she wants to back out but Betty calms her down, the three see Bobby yelling after they smell smoke coming from the salon as the Suarez home mysteriously catches fire and Marisa's designs are ruined.\nDespite the damages, and thanks to a suggestion from Justin, Betty, Marisa and Amanda redesign the burned outfits to make them \"Smokin' Hot\", and Marisa's show is saved, although Wilhelmina ends up getting the credit for \"discovering\" Marisa. Also at the event, Helen tells Marc and Amanda that she got engaged to a guy she met during the show, while Betty and Marc reassure Amanda that she does have talent as a stylist. Just as Claire and Tyler discover each other at the event, Claire does come clean to Tyler afterwards, but tells him not to say anything about being her son yet. However, when Daniel sees Tyler talking to Claire, Claire lies to Daniel, who remarks that he is glad that he will not have to see Tyler again, which hurts Claire's feelings.\nAs for that fire at the Suarez home, Bobby consoles Hilda and tells her that because of the fire that she will be able to collect the insurance. This put doubts into Hilda's head but unaware at the same time outside the house, just as Justin prepares to take out the trash... Justin takes out a pack of cigarettes and a lighter from his jacket and puts them in the trash bag to cover his tracks.\nWhen Betty thanks Wilhelmina for letting Marisa on the show and tells her that she has not been a fan of her taste, Wilhelmina tells her she noticed Betty being afraid of her, comparing it to her own experience with Fey Sommers. Wilhelmina says she never doubted herself, and reassures Betty that taste is having courage in one's own convictions. She then compliments Betty's shoes, which match hers.\n\nProduction\n\"Smokin' Hot\" was written by Brian Tanen and directed by John Scott. It first aired on 10 February 2010 in the United States on ABC, but was originally scheduled to air on 3 February 2010. Kristen Johnston, who previously starred on the American NBC sitcom 3rd Rock from the Sun, makes another guest appearance as Helen, Amanda's friend and temporary roommate. It was reported last year that Johnston took over the role after Paula Abdul left. John Tartaglia, best known for roles puppeteering Princeton and Rod for the Broadway musical Avenue Q, also makes a guest appearance.\n\nRatings\nSmokin' Hot posted a small increase in numbers from the previous week, with 4.7 million viewers tuning in and a 1.7/5 among 18-49s.\n\nReception\nEntertainment Weekly writer Tanner Stransky said the episode 'had it all'; \"A fire at the Queens home of the Suarez clan, Fashion Week, yet another guest spot from the always hilarious Kristen Johnston, male models and the reappearance of Suzuki St. Pierre.\"\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\"Smokin' Hot\" at the Internet Movie Database\n\"Smokin' Hot\" at ABC\n\nSee also\nUgly Betty\nUgly Betty season 4",

    "text": "The Jämthund, also called the Swedish Elkhound, is a breed of dog of the Spitz type that is found in Northern Europe. The Jämthund is eponymous with Jämtland, a province in the middle of Sweden.\n\nHistory\nThe Jämthund is one of a number of breeds of spitz-type hunting dogs that have been known throughout Scandinavia for centuries. Historically these dogs have been used to hunt a wide variety of game including bear, elk, wolf and lynx.\nThe Jämthund received official recognition as a breed in 1946, due to intensive work by Aksel Lindström and others. Before that, both it and the Norwegian Elkhound were seen as the same breed. They are both used for hunting large game, such as moose and bear.\n\nLineage\nThe breed falls under the mitochondrial DNA sub-clade referred to as d1 that is only found in northern Scandinavia. It is the result of a male dog-female wolf hybridization that occurred post-domestication. Subclade d1 that is thought to have originated \"no more than 480–3,000 years ago\" and it includes all Sámi-related breeds: Finnish Lapphund, Swedish Lapphund, Lapponian Herder, Swedish Elkhound, Norwegian Elkhound, Black Norwegian Elkhound and Hällefors Elkhound. The maternal wolf sequence that contributed to these breeds has not been matched across Eurasia.\n\nDescription\nAppearance\nThe dog should have a loosely curled tail that hangs on the back and is not too thin or too tightly curled; when relaxed the tail should hang straight down. This breed has erect ears with a wide space in between them, a medium to long muzzle, and a double coat of various shades of agouti. The eyes are brown. The size of the male is usually 57–65 centimetres (22–26 in), weighing 30–35 kilograms (66–77 lb). Females are usually between 52–60 centimetres (20–24 in), weighing 25–30 kilograms (55–66 lb).\nThe Jämthund should be distinguished from the Norwegian Elkhound. The Norwegian Elkhound is much shorter and stockier than the Jämthund, and its tail shape is very different. It also has a black mask on the muzzle, whereas the Jämthund has a white muzzle, white cheeks and typical wolf markings.\n\nTemperament\nAlthough calm and affectionate with its family, the Jämthund can be dominant with other dogs and has a strong prey drive. A truly all-around canine, it can go from a hunting trip and back to the family hearth with great aplomb. It takes things in stride and does not get ruffled easily, making it a steady partner in the field or at home.\nThe Jämthund is a happy learner who loves to please its owner.\n\nSee also\nDogs portal\nList of dog breeds\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Jämthund at Wikimedia Commons",

He returned to Scotland, settling in Kilmarnock, where he married in 1899, and joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP) around this time. He was elected as a councillor in Kilmarnock, and also became a bailie there.  He was appointed as agent of the Ayrshire Miners' Union, and through this served on the executive of both the Scottish Miners' Federation and the Miners' Federation of Great Britain; and as vice-chairman of the Scottish Trades Union Congress.\nThe ILP was affiliated to the Labour Party, and McKerrell was selected to stand for Labour in Midlothian at the January 1910 general election. However, he withdrew from the contest at short notice. In November 1910, he was adopted as a last-minute candidate for Liverpool Kirkdale at the December general election, taking 41.6% of the vote, a small reduction for the party's performance earlier in the year.\nMcKerrell next stood in the 1911 Kilmarnock Burghs by-election where, as a supporter of women's suffrage, he received significant support from the local branches of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. Despite this, he could take only third place, with 17.3% of the votes cast.\nMcKerrell's brother, David, had returned to mine in South Africa, and became a leader of a strike in the early 1910s. As a result, he was deported back to Scotland, where he stayed with Tom and briefly became a prominent speaker, but died soon after.\nMcKerrell was a supporter of British involvement in World War I, although he opposed conscription, and in 1917 he resigned his union posts to become an official in the Ministry of Labour. This required him to move to London, while his wife remained in Kilmarnock; the two drifted apart, and in 1921, McKerrell asked for a separation. He appeared to regret this decision, and was lined up for a move to the Ministry's Scottish office, but his wife would not take him back.\nIn December 1922, McKerrell took his own life by jumping in front of an Underground train at Charing Cross. The inquest concluded that, in addition to his marital problems, he had been suffering from delusions that there was a conspiracy against him.\n\nReferences\n\nHistory of mental health in the United Kingdom",

    "text": "Nahla Ake is a fictional character in the Star Trek franchise, portrayed by American actress Holly Hunter. First appearing in \"Kids These Days\", the pilot episode of Star Trek: Starfleet Academy, Nahla is introduced as a former Starfleet captain who resigned from the United Federation of Planets after following the law over her own conscience and ruling to separate a mother from her young son. Fifteen years later, she is recruited to become Chancellor of the newly-recommissioned Starfleet Academy. She is a Lanthanite/Human hybrid, and the first Lanthanite main character in a Star Trek series.\nThe character has been well-received by critics, who praised her unique personality and physicality which contrasts with that of previous Star Trek captains, as well as Hunter's performance.\n\nFictional character biography\nSeason 1\nIn 3180 on the Federation outpost Pikaru, Ake is the commanding officer and holds a hearing for pirate Nus Braka, Anisha Mir, and her young son Caleb. In order to avoid starvation, Anisha reveals that she struck a deal with Braka to help him steal food rations from a Federation supply vessel, but became implicated as his accomplice when he murdered the pilot. Ake sentences Braka to a penal colony and Anisha to a rehabilitation camp, telling her that Caleb will be taken as a ward of the Federation. While attempting to comfort him, Caleb steals Ake's badge and escapes. Fifteen years later, Admiral Charles Vance visits Ake, who is now living on Bajor teaching children after she resigned from her post following the trial. Vance tells her he is recomissioning Starfleet Academy and offers here the role of Chancellor, which she initially refuses until he reveals that Caleb has been apprehended by the Torothans. Ake asks Caleb to join Starfleet in exchange for avoiding prison and with the promise she will help him find Anisha, whom she reveals broke out of prison a year prior, and he reluctantly agrees despite his hatred for both Ake and the Federation. Assuming her role as Chancellor, Ake also becomes captain of the Academy's starship and mobile classroom, the USS Athena. The ship is attacked by Braka, who was inadvertently drawn to it by Caleb, but Ake is able to stall and deceive him long enough for Caleb and some of the other cadets to save the day. Arriving at the Starfleet Academy campus in San Francisco, Ake tells Caleb that, despite putting everyone in danger, she can convince her superiors to allow him to remain with Starfleet if that's what he wants. Caleb agrees to stay, and the two have a heart-to-heart where she reveals that her own son was killed during The Burn, a catastrophic cosmic event that brought the Federation to near-collapse.\n\nDevelopment\nCasting\nAke is portrayed by Academy Award-winning American actress Holly Hunter. Her casting in the show's lead role was officially announced on May 21, 2024, revealing that she would \"serve as the captain and chancellor of the Academy, presiding over both the faculty and a new class of Starfleet cadets as they learn to navigate the galaxy in the 32nd century\". In the announcement, showrunners Noga Landau and Alex Kurtzman stated, \"it feels like we’ve spent our entire lives watching Holly Hunter be a stone-cold genius. To have her extraordinary authenticity, fearlessness, sense of humor, and across the board brilliance leading the charge on ‘Starfleet Academy’ is a gift to all of us, and to the enduring legacy of Star Trek.\" Kurtzman later stated in an interview that the character of Nahla Ake was originally written with Hunter in mind, but that the team did not expect her to be interested and that they were shocked and delighted when she \"signed on right away\" after receiving the first scripts.\n The character's name was revealed on July 28, 2025 alongside the roles of the rest of the main cast during the Star Trek universe panel at San Diego Comic-Con.\nDiscussing her casting, Hunter stated that she approached Landau and Kurtzman after being offered the role with thoughts about how the character should behave, explaining that \"I had ideas about Nahla being more of a fluid creature. Somebody who was like liquid, like water,\" and adding that she wanted her movements to be \"feline\" and \"tactile\". Hunter expressed that, while she did some research into the franchise, she was more interested in creating a new and unique character and was not overly concerned about fitting into the mould of previous Star Trek captains noting, \"in a way, that’s just not my business.\" Kurtzman echoed this when explaining the decision to approach Hunter advising that, \"when we were looking to cast Nahla, we knew that we needed an actor who could be different than every other captain yet maintain the authority of what a captain requires. We also knew we wanted her to be quirky because she’s over 420 years old and sort of come to the point in her long, long life where she decides that she no longer wants to wear shoes around the starship.\" Hunter later spoke about how she tended to avoid projects that push certain messages, but that she was drawn to Starfleet Academy ethos of imparting empathy.\n\nCharacterization\nKurtzman noted that the character contains multitudes, and that casting Hunter allowed them to \"take extraordinary risks that you might not be able to take with an actor who couldn’t pull that off\". He explained, \"the character is over 415 years old, so she’s lived an enormous amount of life. That affords her a unique perspective on everything. And because she was a mother and she lost a child, it gives her a unique perspective on what it means to raise the kids of Starfleet Academy, which also qualifies her to be a great chancellor. So, she’s a captain who is happy to walk around the bridge without shoes on, but the minute the chips are down, and something really goes wrong, she takes that chair with real authority\". He felt that one of the character's main strengths was her quirky irreverence and genuine emotion, expressing that Ake \"represents the things that were always my favorite things about the best teachers I had, which were that they were quirky and they thought differently\".\nAke is a half human and half Lanthanite, a long-lived species originally introduced in the second season of Star Trek: Strange New Worlds. The only other Lanthanite in the franchise is Pelia, who is portrayed by Carol Kane. Reviewers noted that the decision for Ake to be part Lanthanite was likely made so that the character could have lived hundreds of years by the start of the show, and would be able to remember the original Federation and Starfleet prior to The Burn, offering her a unique perspective as one of the only living characters to have attended the original Starfleet Academy. Hunter felt it was important to exhibit Ake's age through the way she interacts with the world, particularly through her physicality, explaining that \"how could that manifest in a different way that would not just be flouting protocol because oh, I’m a rebel? It’s not as simple as that. It’s more selfish. It’s more interior, but the interior has been made totally not precious. It’s just part of her now. The barefoot thing was something that Alex had put in the script that I just loved, and it kind of snowballed from there. When I got on set, I saw how adventurous the furniture could be for me.\" The characters name translates to ‘water in the desert’ which helped to influence Hunter's performance, comparing Nahla's physicality to that of a liquid and explaining \"wherever I am, whatever environment that I’m in, I’m going to explore it with my body\".\n\nReception\nThe character, and Hunter's portrayal, has received generally positive reviews from critics. Lacy Braugher of Den of Geek wrote that, \"Hunter is great, deftly holding a multitude of tensions simultaneously within her performance. Effortlessly shifting between gravitas, an almost painful sincerity, and a certain kind of playful oddness, she serves multiple roles within the world of Starfleet Academy, much like the ship she captains\", and declared Nahla \"one of the most intriguing new characters that Star Trek has introduced in quite some time\". Graeme Virtue of The Guardian also praised the how the character differed from previous captains writing, \"Hunter’s free-spirited Ake is unlike any other Trek captain. She casually goes barefoot, favours old-school Two Ronnies specs, and has a habit of folding her legs up into the captain’s chair in a way that feels genuinely transgressive.\" Angie Han of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \"Hunter is a total delight as the half-Lanthanite Nahla, whose tiny stature, playful humor and disregard for propriety (this is a woman who keeps inventing new ways to slouch into chairs) belie her quiet strength as a Starfleet officer.\" Ben Travers of IndieWire called Hunter's performance \"a floodlight of personality\".\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nNahla Ake at Memory Alpha",

    "text": "Ambo (Oromo: Amboo, Amharic: አምቦ) is a town in west-central Ethiopia. Located in the West Shewa Zone of Oromia Region, west of Addis Ababa, it is the capital city of West Shewa zone. This town has a latitude and longitude of 8°59′N 37°51′E and an elevation of 2,101 meters.\nAmbo is known for its mineral water, which is bottled outside of town; it is reportedly the most popular brand in Ethiopia. Nearby attractions include Mount Wenchi to the south with its crater lake, and the Guder, Teltele and Huluka Falls. Ambo is also the location of a research station of the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research; initiated in 1977, this station hosts research in protecting major crops in Ethiopia. The town's market day is Tuesday, thursday and Saturday.\n\nHistory\nAfter Lij Iyasu was captured, he was held for a while at Ambo, before being transferred to house arrest at Fiche. In the early 1930s, Mahtama Selassie Walda Mesqal, who had studied agriculture in France and Spain, started an agricultural station near the town. By 1933, Ambo had started to be a recreation place with the construction of some bath cabins with cisterns of concrete, and a couple of European-type hotels, as well as simple villas for the Emperor and important persons.\nBy 1938, the Guida dell'A.O.I.  described improvements to Ambo which included a post office, telephone service, a clinic for outpatients, restaurants, and a projected hotel. Two Italian forts were constructed, and in a cave the Italians had erected a monument for casualties of the Pusteria Division. The approach to Ambo was still over an old bridge, and below it a natural bridge used by caravans.\nWhen the Allies reached Ambo with a South African armored car patrol in early 1941, they had to evacuate 140 \"utterly panicked Italians\". The British operated an improvised camp for prisoners-of-war at Ambo until 1942.\nAt least as early as 1955, there was a 170 kW hydro-electric power station in the town; by 1965 the installed electrical capacity was 210 kVA, with annual production of 132,000 kWh. In 1958 Ambo was one of 27 places in Ethiopia ranked as First Class Township. That same year, the Ambo Agricultural School and Ambo Forestry School had 150 students. A light earth tremor was felt in the evening of 23 January 1968; its epicenter was somewhere near Ambo but no damage occurred.\nIn the last weeks of the Ethiopian Civil War, military units of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front captured Ambo on 25 April 1991 from the disintegrating units of the Derg. This was part of their strategy to avoid a direct assault on the capital, Addis Ababa, and instead surround the city and isolate it from the rest of the country.\nA prominent Oromo businessman, Daraaraa Kafani, was murdered in front of his home; eyewitnesses said he was slain by a man wearing a military uniform. His funeral was attended by thousands of Oromos in Ambo; police arrested more than 37 people, stating that they were supporters of the Oromo Liberation Front on 3 September. In the following February, 70 year old Oromo elder Dandana Gurmu was arrested on the accusation that he was a supporter of the OLF.\nOn 24 April 2003, a Tigrayan student was shot and killed and two others injured in a clash between Oromo and Tigrayan students at the Ambo Agricultural College. The killing was believed to be retaliation for the severe beating of an Oromo student in Mek'ele in December 2002. By the year's end, five persons were in police custody awaiting trial.\n\nDemographics\nThe 2007 national census reported a total population for Ambo of 48,171, of whom 24,634 were men and 23,537 were women. The majority of the inhabitants said they observed Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, with 65.18% of the population reporting they observed this belief, while 27.45% of the population were Protestant.\nThe 1994 census reported this town had a total population of 27,636 of whom 13,380 were males and 14,256 were females.\n\nEducation\nAmbo Comprehensive Senior Secondary School, with its large library and modern laboratory has been one of the best high schools in the country. The school celebrated its 50th anniversary (Golden Jubilee) in 2006. Prominent alumni include poet Tsegaye Gebre-Medhin and former Ethiopian Prime minister Tesfaye Dinka. Ambo students' movement played notable role in the Ethiopian student movement, particularly during the final years of the feudal regime and the recurring student unrest of the current administration.\nAmbo High School absorbs students from surrounding woredas which extends as far as East Wollega Zone. The concentration of young students in the town has been significant contributor for the city's high political consciousness.\n\nUniversity\nThe city is the home of Ambo University.\n\nSister city\nOn 18 December 2006, the Oromia Region government signed an agreement with Henan in China to establish a sister city program with Xuchang.\nGuder and gedo, ginchi\n\nSee also\nAmbo Mineral Water\n\nNotes\nBibliography\nVV.AA.

    "text": "Arnon Goldfinger (Hebrew: ארנון גולדפינגר; born 1963) is an Israeli film director and scriptwriter, winner of two Israeli Academy Awards, known for his films The Komediant and The Flat.\n\nEarly life\nArnon Goldfinger was born in Ramat Gan, Israel, to parents who immigrated from Germany and Czechoslovakia. As a youth he spent many hours sitting at the chess board, eventually becoming one of the most exceptional young chess players in Israel. He attended Tel Aviv University where he majored in cinema with a minor in philosophy. He completed his studies with honors and in 1987 was chosen as the outstanding student in the faculty of the arts and was granted the Rector's Scholarship.\nIn 1990 he became the director of the Third International Student Film Festival in Tel Aviv. In the summer of 1990 Goldfinger was selected, as one of 12 students from around Europe, to take part in the European summer film school in Belgrade with renowned Polish filmmaker Krzysztof Zanussi  as the lead instructor.\n\nTeaching career\nUpon graduation he began teaching, directing and scriptwriting at the leading film schools in Israel including the Sam Spiegel Film School, Maaleh, Camera Obscura and the film department at Tel Aviv University where he teaches till this day.\n\nDirecting career\nArnon Goldfinger's first full-length film was released in 1999. The Komediant is a documentary about the Burstein family – Yiddish vaudeville artists – Mike Burstein (stage name Mike Burstyn), his parents and twin sister – and touches on the history of Yiddish theater. Goldfinger worked on this film for four years and in May 2000 the film was released theatrically in Israel, becoming the first documentary film in years that was commercially released.\nThe film was widely acclaimed and Goldfinger was chosen by the mainstream daily Yedioth Ahronoth as one of the top five people in cinema that year. In 2002 \"The Komediant\" was theatrically released in the US. It was distributed by New Yorker Films and screened at over 50 cinemas nationwide, including Lincoln Plaza in New York City and at dozens of film festivals. The Chicago Film Critics dubbed the film one of the year's top five documentaries.\nIn 2011 Goldfinger's second full-length film was released. The Flat is an Israeli- German coproduction whose German partner is the production company Zero One Film. The film opens with the director and members of his family gathered in his grandmother's apartment shortly after her death, in order to clear out the contents. There Goldfinger soon finds various items that reveal an astonishing chapter in the family's history, one that had been kept under wraps for decades, namely the co-operation between his Tuchler grandparents and the SS officer Leopold von Mildenstein in the cause of Zionism.\n\"The Flat\" had its premiere at the 2011 Jerusalem Film Festival. In his review, critic Avner Shavit calls the film \"one of the best Israeli documentary films of all time\" and added \"the audience at the screening yesterday experienced a sort of state of shock from the experience\". In September 2011 \"The Flat\" was theatrically released in Israel where it has been receiving rave reviews. Time Out Tel Aviv placed the film at the top of its recommended list for more than 30 weeks under the headline: \"not to be missed\". The publication also chose the film as one of the 25 most significant works of art for the year 2011. The Flat was commercially released in Germany in June 2012 and in the US in October 2012. The film won many film awards including the Israeli Film Academy Award for Best Documentary (\"Ophir\")  2011 and was among the three final nominees for the German Film Academy Award for Best Documentary (\"Lola\") 2013 and among the final nominees for the German TV Grimme Award 2014.\n\nFilmography\nThe Benny Zinger Show (1993, short film, written and directed)\nSchindler's children (1993, Short TV documentary, written and directed)\nAntonnela in the holy land (1994, TV documentary, written and directed)\nAnne's Way (1995, TV documentary, written and directed)\nThe Komediant (1999, directed and co-produced)\nThe Flat (2011, written, directed and co-produced)\nA tale beginning in three rooms (2023, Short documentary, written and directed)\n\nAwards\nMoograbi Award – Third Best Film, – The Benny Zinger Show (1993)\nChicago International Film Festival – Certificate of Merit – The Benny Zinger Show (1993)\nIsraeli Academy Award – Best Documentary – The Komediant (1999)\nHaifa International Film Festival – Best Documentary – The Komediant (1999)\nDoc Aviv – Best editing – The Komediant (1999)\nJerusalem Film Festival – Best director of a full-length documentary – The Flat\nIsraeli Academy Award (\"ophir\") – Best Documentary – The Flat\nIsraeli documentary filmmakers Forum – Best Film – The Flat\nIsraeli documentary filmmakers Forum – Best Director – The Flat\nIsraeli documentary filmmakers Forum – Best research – The Flat\nBavarian Film Award – Best Documentary – The Flat\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nArnon Goldfinger at IMDb\nArnon Goldfinger Quotes And Sayings at Wordsquotes.com",

    "title": "USS Aries (AK-51)",
    "text": "USS Aries (AK-51) (1918–1952) was a United States Navy cargo ship built as Lake Geneva under a United States Shipping Board (USSB) contract in 1918 at Duluth, Minnesota, by the McDougall Duluth Shipbuilding Company, to augment American logistics capability during World War I. The freighter was delivered to the Navy at Montreal, Quebec, Canada, on 21 September 1918 and was placed in commission the following day for service in the Naval Overseas Transportation Service. Aries was named for the constellation.\nAfter fitting out, the freighter sailed for France late in October and arrived at St. Nazaire on 11 November, the day Germany signed the armistice ending the fighting of World War I. Lake Geneva was then assigned to European waters. Based at Cardiff, Wales, she carried coal from that port and from Belfast, Ireland, to French ports.\nAfter continuing this duty through the spring of 1919, she sailed for Charleston, South Carolina, carrying some 1,500 tons of Army ordnance material.  However, while en route to that port, she was diverted to Newport News, Virginia, where she arrived on 12 July.\n\nBetween the wars\nAfter discharging her cargo, Lake Geneva was slated for demobilization.  She was decommissioned on 17 July 1919 and then returned to the USSB, in whose hands she remained until the mid-1920s. She was then sold to the Bison Steam Ship Company, of Tonawanda, New York, and renamed John J. O'Hagan in honor of the manager of the firm which had purchased her.  She operated out of Buffalo, New York carrying coal and iron ore on the Great Lakes.\n\nWorld War II service\nShortly before the United States entered World War II, the Federal Government repurchased the ship.  She was transferred from the Maritime Commission to the US Navy on 22 September 1941.  Renamed Manomet on 15 October 1941 and designated AG-37, the freighter was prepared for naval service at East Boston, Massachusetts, by the General Ship and Engine Works. During this work, Manomet was renamed Aries on 7 January 1942 and simultaneously re-designated AK-51. She was delivered on 23 May 1942 to the Marine Lines  of New York City, which operated her on a contract basis for the Naval Transportation Service until early July. Returned to Navy custody on 11 July 1942, Aries was placed in commission on 18 July 1942 at the Bethlehem Steel Company in Brooklyn, New York and Lieutenant Philip S. Deane, Jr., USNR, assumed temporary command for Commander Leif Sederholt, USNR, who reported a week later.\nAfter taking on cargo, ammunition, and supplies, the cargo ship stood out to sea and joined a convoy bound for Iceland.  She stopped at Halifax, Nova Scotia, for three days before resuming her voyage to Iceland.  On 18 August, she reached Reykjavík and discharged equipment and supplies ashore. For the next 12 months, Aries operated in Icelandic waters under the orders of Commanding Officer, Naval Operating Base, Iceland, transporting US Army cargo between the Icelandic ports of Reykjavík, Akranes, Keflavík, Hvalfjörður, Budareyri, Seyðisfjörður, and Akureyri.\nThe ship left Iceland on 21 August 1943, on a course for the United States, and reached Boston, Massachusetts on 3 September. She then entered a shipyard for alterations and repairs.  On 5 December, the vessel joined a southbound convoy and sailed to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  She left Cuba on 5 January 1944, proceeded to the Panama Canal Zone, and moored at Balboa for repairs to her main engine before setting a course for San Diego, California.\nUpon reaching San Diego on 12 February, the vessel underwent more repairs to her main engine.  Late in April, she entered the Mare Island Navy Yard at Vallejo, California, for replacement of the main engine. After a series of sea trials, the ship got underway on 6 September, bound for Pearl Harbor and arrived there on the 18th.  She was drydocked briefly for the installation of a new propeller before sailing for the South Pacific on 6 October.\nAries reached Manus in the Admiralty Islands, on 28 October and commenced provisioning warships of the 3rd Fleet. The ship was damaged there by the November 1944 USS Mount Hood (AE-11) explosion.  After emptying her holds, the vessel took on more cargo and weighed anchor on 10 December.  She made Ulithi five days later and began unloading operations.  The ship had completed this task by 7 January 1945 and, a week later, sailed for Guam.  She unloaded cargo there and was back at Ulithi on 25 January.  The vessel remained at the atoll conducting intraharbor cargo operations until 25 April.  She then began preparations for the Battle of Leyte Gulf in the Philippines.\nOn 20 May, the ship set a course for San Pedro Bay.  She arrived there on the 24th and commenced discharging her cargo.  In mid-June, the vessel began taking on various equipment and supplies for transit to Ulithi.  She got underway on 2 July, arrived back at Ulithi on the 8th, and was assigned duty as a station ship, her role through the end of hostilities on 15 August.\n\nAfter VJ Day\nAries left Ulithi on the 22nd and proceeded to Apra Harbor, Guam.  There, she took on goods for shipment to Leyte.  The vessel reached Philippine waters on 5 September and remained off Leyte engaged in cargo operations through early October.  The vessel departed the area on the 7th and dropped anchor at Eniwetok 10 days later.  After filling her cargo holds, she set a course for Japan, arrived in Tokyo Bay on 6 November, and began discharging her supplies in support of occupation forces ashore.\nOn 30 November, the cargo ship left Japanese waters and set a course for the United States.  She paused en route at Midway on 11 December and finally reached San Francisco on the 24th.  The ship then discharged all her cargo and ammunition in preparation for deactivation.\n\nFinal disposition\nShe later moved to Oakland, California, where she was decommissioned on 28 March 1946.  Her name was struck from the Navy list on 17 April 1946.  The vessel was transferred to the Maritime Commission on 1 July 1946.  She was sold on 5 May 1947 to Captain A. S. Oko for operation as a bulk carrier. She was scrapped in 1952.\n\nSee also\nUSS Menemsha (AG-39) sister ship in Navy\nUSS Lake Pepin (ID 4215) sister ship in Navy in 1918\n\nReferences\nThis article incorporates text from the public domain Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships.

    "title": "Foreign policy analysis",
    "text": "Foreign policy analysis (FPA) is a technique within the international relations sub-field of political science dealing with theory, development, and empirical study regarding the processes and outcomes of foreign policy.\nFPA is the study of the management of external relations and activities of state. Foreign policy involves goals, strategies, measures, management methods, guidelines, directives, agreements, and so on. National governments may conduct international relations not only with other nation-states but also with international organizations and non-governmental organizations.\nManaging foreign relations need carefully considered plans of actions that are adapted to foreign interests and concerns of the government.\n\nStudy\nForeign policy analysis (FPA) involves the study of how a state makes foreign policy. As it analyzes the decision making process, FPA involves the study of both international and domestic politics. FPA also draws upon the study of diplomacy, war, intergovernmental organizations, and economic sanctions, each of which are means by which a state may implement foreign policy. In academia, FPA is most commonly taught within the discipline of public policy within political science or political studies, and the study of international relations. FPA can also be considered a sub-field of the study of international relations (IR), which aims to understand the processes behind foreign policy decision making. The most prominent scholars in this field of study include Richard Snyder, James Rosenau, Alexander George, Graham Allison and Irving Janis.\nAccording to foreignpolicyanalysis.org, \"As a field of study, FPA is characterized by its actor-specific focus. In the simplest terms, it is the study of the process, effects, causes, or outputs of foreign policy decision-making in either a comparative or case-specific manner. The underlying and often implicit argument theorizes that human beings, acting as a group or within a group, compose and cause change in international politics.\" In other words, FPA can be understood as a critique of the dominant structuralist approaches in IR.\n\nStages in decision making\nThe making of foreign policy involves a number of stages:\n\nAssessment of the international and domestic political environment - Foreign policy is made and implemented within an international and domestic political context, which must be understood by a state in order to determine the best foreign policy option. For example, a state may need to respond to an international crisis.\nGoal setting - A state has multiple foreign policy goals. A state must determine which goal is affected by the international and domestic political environment at any given time. In addition, foreign policy goals may conflict, which will require the state to prioritize.\nDetermination of policy options - A state must then determine what policy options are available to meet the goal or goals set in light of the political environment. This will involve an assessment of the state's capacity implement policy options and an assessment of the consequences of each policy option.\nFormal decision making action - A formal foreign policy decision will be taken at some level within a government. Foreign policy decisions are usually made by the executive branch of government. Common governmental actors or institutions which make foreign policy decisions include: the head of state (such as a president) or head of government (such as a prime minister), cabinet, or minister.\nImplementation of chosen policy option - Once a foreign policy option has been chosen, and a formal decision has been made, then the policy must be implemented. Foreign policy is most commonly implemented by specialist foreign policy arms of the state bureaucracy, such as a Ministry of Foreign Affairs or State Department. Other departments may also have a role in implementing foreign policy, such as departments for: trade, defence, and aid.\n\nKey approaches\n(as put forward by Graham T. Allison in 1969. For a more comprehensive description see his Book Essence of Decision 1971/1999)\n\nRational actor model\nThe rational actor model is based on rational choice theory. The model adopts the state as the primary unit of analysis, and inter-state relations (or international relations) as the context for analysis. The state is seen as a monolithic unitary actor, capable of making rational decisions based on preference ranking and value maximization.\nAccording to the rational actor model, a rational decision making process is used by a state. This process includes:\n\nGoal setting and ranking.\nConsideration of options.\nAssessment of consequences.\nProfit maximization.\nIn other words, it provides models for answering the question: with that information what would be the best decision for reaching one's goal? In this theory, the underlying assumption is that governments are unified and rational, in this manner, they would seek for carefully planned and well-defined foreign policy goals. In this sense, rational choice model is primarily a realist perspective of foreign policy level of analysis.\nThe rational actor model has been subject to criticism. The model tends to neglect a range of political variables, of which Michael Clarke includes: \"political decisions, non-political decisions, bureaucratic procedures, continuations of previous policy, and sheer accident.\"  It also ignores emotions, emotional flooding, selective attention, and groupthink.\n\nGovernmental Bargaining Model\nIn this model the state is not seen as a monolithic unitary actor. Instead it is a collection of different bureaucracies vying for increasing their funding and size. Individual decision makers try to bargain and compete for influence with their own particular goal in mind. Things are often viewed as a zero-sum game where one bureaucracy's \"win\" or increasing their level of funding is seen as a loss for another bureaucracy. Here decisions are made by bureaucracies competing against each other and suggesting solutions to problems that would involve using their resources so as to increase their level of importance. Bureaucratic politics model, in keeping with its pluralistic connotation, can also refer to that inner state processes including no institutional actors, who with their informal channels would affect policy results.\n\nOrganizational Process Model\nOrganizational Processes model emerges from clusters of governmental organizations that look after their own best interests and follow 'standard operating procedures'. In this model different bureaucracies have different standard operating procedures. These procedures are made in order to allow day-to-day operations to be carried out. Often an order or decision will have to work around these standard procedures. It is often exceedingly difficult for a bureaucracy to do something \"out of character\" or contrary to their standard procedures.\n\nOther models\nInter-branch politics model\nSelf-aggrandizement model - In this model one leader acts on behalf of his or her interests. (also known as cognitive processes and psychology approach)\nPolitical process model - In this model the decision making body is affected by many non-governmental actors such as NGOs or the media.\nMultilevel and Multidimensional approach - In this model, scholars study particular aspects of foreign policy making by using various major theories.\nSocial constructivist approach - In this model, scholars focus on the role of ideas, discourse, and identity to make FPA.\n\nInstitutions\nCouncil on Foreign Relations\nChatham House\nAmerican Enterprise Institute\nBrookings Institution\nWoodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars\n\nNotes and references\nFurther reading\nChris Alden and Amnon Aran, Foreign Policy Analysis: New Approaches, Abingdon: Routledge, 2012.\nRainer Baumann and Frank A.

His father was one of the survivors of the Bleiburg repatriations. He attended elementary school at Kruševo near Obrovac, then moved with his family to Zagreb where he finished high school.\nDuring his education in high school, Karamarko played guitar and performed in Students' Home, where other popular bands also held concerts, among which Azra, Film, Idoli and others. As a youngster, Karamarko played basketball, and he almost started to join some basketball clubs; however, he chose education instead of sports.\nIn 1979 he enrolled at the University of Zagreb's Faculty of Law, but later dropped out and eventually switched to studying history at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences in 1982, before graduating in 1985.\nAccording to Josip Manolić, to whom he was a chief of cabinet when Manolić become the Prime Minister, Karamarko worked for the State Security Administration (UDBA), the secret police of Yugoslavia. Manolić said that Karamarko worked for UDBA because he was blackmailed for involvement in petty criminal activities. Karamarko sued Manolić for libel regarding Manolić's interview to Nacional, but Manolić was acquitted in 2018 after testimonies by, among others, Krunislav Olujić, who confirmed that President Franjo Tuđman indicated that Vladimir Šeks and Karamarko worked for the secret police before democratization.\nDuring his university days Karamarko was known as a shy student who only mingled with students hailing from Dalmatia or Herzegovina. As a twenty-year-old, Karamarko joined the Croatian Catholic Assembly Mi (We). In 1982, Karamarko visited Vatican City with a group of his friends where they waved the Croatian flag. As a result, he was reportedly deprived of a passport by Yugoslavia's authorities. A journalist, Željko Peratović, later disputed that Karamarko was a  Catholic dissident, claiming that UDBA had helped him  obtain a job in the Croatian State Archives and finish his studies. In the 1980s Karamarko met his future wife, Enisa Muftić, daughter of Osman Muftić, who later briefly served as minister of science in the Cabinet of Stjepan Mesić in 1990.\n\nCareer\nKaramarko was one of the founders of the Croatian Democratic Union in 1989 and in June 1991 he was named Chief of Cabinet of Josip Manolić, Prime Minister of Croatia. He continued to serve as Chief of Cabinet for Manolić's successor, Franjo Gregurić until September 1992 when he became Chief of Cabinet of the Speaker of the Croatian Parliament, Stjepan Mesić. A year later he became Director of the Zagreb Police Administration and in 1996 he was named Assistant Interior Minister. In 1998 he also became secretary of the Croatian Automobile Club.\nDuring the 2000 presidential election he headed Stjepan Mesić's election campaign. Mesić won the election and later named Karamarko as his national security advisor and head of the National Security Office. In 2002 Karamarko was appointed director of the Counterintelligence Agency (POA) and in 2006 he was named director of the Security and Intelligence Agency (SOA).\nIn October 2008 Prime Minister Ivo Sanader named him Minister of the Interior and he remained in that post until December 2011 when HDZ was defeated in the 2011 general election. He acted as an independent minister until September 2011, when he joined HDZ for the second time. In May 2012 he won the party election and became the fourth president of HDZ, succeeding former Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor.\n\nPolitical career\nHe was assigned by Ivan Bobetko to unload the party's official newspaper Glasnik HDZ-a from a truck with his friends. Before Franjo Tuđman was elected president, Karamarko supported presidency of Marko Veselica or Vlado Veselica. Soon, Karamarko met an influential HDZ member, Vice Vukojević who involved him in organization of the first HDZ's assembly. Karamarko's connections with HDZ helped him re-establish contact with people from his hometown, where he brought arms bought by Croatian expatriates. In 1991, after a shorter fight with the Army of Serb Krajina, Karamarko prepared housing for Croatian refugees, which increased his reputation among people from the Zadar area.\nOn the recommendation of Vukojević, who was at the time the assistant to Interior Minister and Josip Perković, assistant Defence Minister, on 17 June 1991, Karamarko was named chief of cabinet of Prime Minister Josip Manolić. Karamarko became friends with Stjepan Mesić. Manolić's successor, Franjo Gregurić, left Karamarko as his chief of cabinet.\nOn 10 September 1992, when the Second Assembly of the Croatian Parliament was formed, Mesić, at the time Speaker of Parliament, named him chief of his cabinet. Karamarko remained Mesić's cabinet chief until 15 June 1993, when he was named chief of police in Zagreb. That year, he married Enisa Muftić.\nFrom 1993 until 1996, Karamarko served as director of Zagreb Police Administration, and from 1996 to 1998 served as Assistant Minister of Internal Affairs. After he ended his career as assistant minister, he became secretary of the Croatian Automobile Club.\nDuring the 2000 presidential election Karamarko was chief of Mesić's election campaign. Mesić, at the time member of the Croatian People's Party, won the election with 56% of votes in the second round against Dražen Budiša of the Croatian Social Liberal Party. After Mesić had won the election, Karamarko was named as his advisor for national security.\nHe also served as the head of National Security Office (UNS) from 2000 to 2002, as the head of Counterintelligence Agency (POA) from 2004 to 2006, and as the head of Security and Intelligence Agency (SOA) from 2006 to 2008.\n\nPolitical stances\nIn May 2015. Karamarko gave the interview to Croatian weekly Globus, after which Croatian media dubbed his new program \"The Anti-communist Manifesto\" . In it Karamarko advocated for \"comprehensive change of general public climate, complete system of values, nullification of communist indoctrination and abolishment of wrong and degenerate interpretation of contemporary history\". He criticized his main rivals Social Democratic Party of Croatia, claiming that: \"they, as a successor of League of Communists of Croatia, never renounced nor condemned its own totalitarianism.\" and urged them to: \"renounce Josip Broz Tito, totalitarianism and to condemn Tito's crimes.\"\nIn January 2018., while commenting recent political events in Croatia on Facebook, Karamarko wrote that his: \"political thought is very close to that of Viktor Orban's Christmas message\".\n\nPresident of Croatian Democratic Union\nIn May 2012., Karamarko was elected president of Croatian Democratic Union, main center-right political party in Croatia. After the election, Karamarko radicalised his party's politics and eventually became one of the most unpopular politicians in the country Such situation forced his party to enter a coalition with a new party in Croatia, Bridge of Independent Lists (Most), in the aftermath of parliamentary elections, 2015. The coalition was formed because Most surprisingly won 19 seats in the parliament and thus became \"a kingmaker\" for forming the next government, having to decide between a conservative or a social democratic government. After the negotiations between HDZ and Most, on January 22, 2016, both parties agreed to elect non-partisan Tihomir Orešković as new prime minister of Croatia, while Karamarko became the First Deputy Prime Minister.\n\nMotion of no confidence and government crisis\nOn May 18, 2016, Social Democratic Party (SDP) begun motion of no confidence against Karamarko, after Nacional weekly published secret contracts on business cooperation of his wife Ana Šarić and Josip Petrović, special adviser and lobbyist of the MOL Group, a Hungarian oil corporation that gained control of Croatia's national oil company INA through a corruption scandal involving former Prime Minister Ivo Sanader. According to contracts, Šarić, a marketing expert, advised Petrović on the energy business and was paid for that at least 60,000 euros. Contracts are controversial since Croatia and MOL are currently in the arbitration proceeding which was started by MOL for Croatia's alleged violation of certain obligations and procedures in connection with MOL's investment in Croatia. In addition, contracts were examined by the Croatian Committee on Conflict of Interest which determined that Karamarko was indeed in conflict of interest when he publicly shared his views and suggested that Croatia should pull out of the arbitration proceedings. The vote was supposed to take place by June 18, 2016, and it had support of 80 MP's, including those of his coalition partners Most, with 76 needed. On June 15, 2016, Karamarko resigned as First Deputy Prime Minister.\nAfter Karamarko's resignation from the place of First Deputy Prime Minister, HDZ decided to run a revenge motion of no confidence against prime minister Orešković The vote took place on 16 June 2016 and it was successful with 125 MPs in favor, 15 against and 2 abstentions, which caused the government to collapse. HDZ then tried to form a new majority in the parliament with no success, despite party members claiming that they have the support of sufficient number MPs. Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović, therefore decided to schedule the new parliamentary elections for September 2016. As a consequence of failing to form a new majority in the parliament, Karamarko decided to resign from his position of president of Croatian Democratic Union on 21 June 2016. One month later, Andrej Plenković was elected as Karamarko's successor on head of HDZ.\n\nPost resignation\nAfter resignation, Karamarko spent some time traveling around the world and in May 2017, he announced that he decided to establish a think-tank organisation - Institute for Security and Prosperity of Croatia. The move which was later mocked by some of his former party members.\n\nReferences\nNotes\nNews reports\n\n\n== External links ==",

    "text": "Glove stretcher is a 19th century device for \"easing\" (stretching) the gloves. The rounded tips of the stretchers, typically made of two wooden pieces hinged in the middle and spring-loaded, were placed inside the fingers of a glove. The handles were then squeezed so the fingers were stretched, allowing the glove to be put on without damaging it. The scissors-like implements were also made from metal and celluloid.\n\nHistory\nGlove stretchers were popular in the Victorian era. \nKid leather was considered to be the best material for gloves worn by a proper Victorian lady, as cotton and silk were easily stretchable, thus revealing the imperfections of a hand. The leather of a young goat was essential to emulate the desired appearance of a hand with tapered fingertips. The scissor-like stretchers were helping to preserve the shape of the glove fingers after washing.\nA 1908 advice on washing the chamois gloves suggests using the stretcher as an alternative to washing and drying the gloves on hands.\nIn the 19th century the stretchers were widespread, every \"good\" shop or household was expected to have one. In the 21st century the original device resembling the scissors is largely forgotten. Haglund reports that while playing a version of the Kim's game, children are no longer able to guess the purpose of the implement.\n\nReferences\nSources\nNational Coal Mining Museum (2021). \"Victorian home\" (PDF). www.ncm.org.uk.

    "text": "The Sixth \"Shesto\" government of Bulgaria was the government of the Principality of Bulgaria, appointed by Knyaz Alexander I of Battenberg with Decree No. 565 on July 1, 1881, and was under his direct leadership. Ruled until June 23, 1882 under the so-called \"Regime of Full Powers,\" then succeeded by the government of Leonid Sobolev. This is the only Bulgarian government without a prime minister.\n\nPolicies\nImmediately after the Second Grand National Assembly completed its work, a new cabinet without a prime minister was formed, in which the conservatives and Russian generals played a leading role. The knyaz skillfully used the military generals and their Russian influence to solidify his position after the coup.During its one-year administration, the government conducted a number of constructive reforms: the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Religion was restructured according to a more modern European model; a State Council was formed; the gendarmerie came under the authority of the Ministry of War. A committee has been organized to resolve the rural landlord issue; rules for the construction of private buildings have been approved, and a Commission for the Implementation, Completion, and Ordering of the Judicial Process has been appointed. The first curricula and statutes of the Pedagogical School have been developed.\nThe government conducted a very repressive policy against its political opponents. The leaders of the Liberal Party Dragan Tsankov and Petko Slaveykov were imprisoned. The Press Law was amended in a way to make journalists require a permit from the Ministry of Interior in order to publish in a newspaper. Protest meetings and rallies were in one way or another prohibited by law.\nAddressing issues related to rail transport was a major priority for the cabinet's foreign policy. Conservatives supported the project of a French company for the construction of the Bulgarian railway network as they found it the most beneficial for national interests. On the other side Russian generals and diplomatic representatives in the country were supportive of the offer of a Russian company. Disagreements in the cabinet over the railway issue were starting to strain on the Bulgarian-Russian relations. The knyaz was trying to stabilize the domestic political situation in the country by forming a new coalition cabinet with the participation of Dragan Tsankov's moderate liberals and conservatives, but his attempts ended in failure.\nThe disagreements between the two factions regarding the Regime of the Mandates proved insurmountable. To resolve the crisis, the knyaz once again used the authority of Russia, and on 15 April 1892, during his visit to St. Petersburg, he managed to persuade Emperor Alexander III to recall diplomat Hitrovo and send Russian General Leonid Sobolev to Bulgaria to head a new cabinet.\n\nCabinet\nChanges in Cabinet\nNotable Events\n1 July 1881 – By decision of the Second Grand National Assembly, a \"Regime of Full Powers\" was established for Knyaz Alexander I. The same day, Prime Minister Kasimir Ehrnrooth resigned and the knyaz appointed a new composition of the council of ministers without the sanction of the members of Parliament.\nSeptember 1881 – The institution of extraordinary commissioners, introduced after the April coup d'état of the same year, was abolished in an attempt to calm public life.\n31 December 1881 - Conservative Grigor Nachovich heads the Ministry of the Interior after Russian Colonel Arnold Remlingen is removed from office due to the temporary ban on the conservative newspaper \"Bulgarian Voice.\"\n1 January 1882 - The State Council, which developed and approved legislation during the Regime of Capacities, began its work.\n6 February 1882 – As a measure against the growing agitation for the restoration of the Tarnovo Constitution, the authorities imprisoned the leader of the liberals Dragan Tsankov in Vratsa.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "The Nightingale of Iran is a six episode documentary podcast co-created by sisters Danielle Dardashti and Galeet Dardashti, presented by the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, and distributed by PRX.\nIn the show, the sisters explore their family's multi-generational puzzling musical history, and search for the truth of why their family left Iran in the 1960s at the height of national fame.\nDanielle Dardashti is the host, writer, director, and senior producer. Galeet Dardashti is the musical director, producer, and subject expert. The show includes clips of music and family tapes, as well as interviews with experts and family members.\n\nBackground\nThe six-episode audio documentary was released in March 2024.\nYounes Dardashti, an Iranian musical icon and grandfather of Danielle and Galeet, was known as the \"Nightingale of Iran\" for his powerful voice. In the Dardashti family, his Jewish musical legacy was cherished and passed down through generations. Their father, Younes’ son Farid, became a teen idol, singing on Iranian TV in the 1960s before leaving to study in the United States. There he met their mother, Sheila, an Ashkenazi folk singer from New York. As children, Danielle, Galeet and their sister Michelle (now the rabbi at Brooklyn's Kane Street Synagogue) traveled the country with their parents in a Jewish American family band.\nIt was only when the sisters began researching their grandfather that another image emerged — that of a Jewish Iranian artist who never found the same acceptance among Jews as he did with Iran's Muslim public, an audience he would ultimately lose in the Iranian Revolution. Performing under the shadow of a stigmatized tradition, in which Jews barred from many industries were historically overrepresented as hired musicians or “motrebs,” Younes left Iran during a short-lived golden age for its Jewish minority.\n\nReception\nIn 2024 the show was an official participant in the Tribeca Festival 2024 Creators Market.\nThe Nightingale of Iran podcast has generated press attention from a number of media outlets, including Jewish Journal, The Wrap, Hadassah Magazine, Kveller, Variety, Hey Alma, JTA, Haaretz, My Jewish Learning, Mentally?

Owing to the size of the Lin family clan, the vast site can be divided into two sections, the Upper (頂厝) and Lower (下厝) Mansions. The Lai Garden (萊園; Laiyuan) constructed by Lin Wenqin is commonly known as The Lin Family Garden (林家花園).\n\nLin family mansion\nUpper Mansion (頂厝)\nThe Hibiscus-Mirror Studio (蓉鏡齋): A sanheyuan (三合院) constructed of red kiln-baked bricks, it was rebuilt as the Hibiscus-Mirror Studio for use as a private school around 1887; the semicircular panchi (泮池) in the front courtyard was dug to resemble those in Confucian Temples.\nTower of Prospective Fragrance Building Group (景薰樓組群): Work began sometime before 1864.

In 1863, Lin Wenqin, having passed the County Examination, constructed Laiyuan on the foothills of Wufeng, and offered performances for the diversion of his mother, Madame Luo (羅太夫人). The name of the gardens derives from the story of the filial Old Master Lai (老萊子), who even after reaching 70 years of age, would still dress in gaudy clothing and entertain his elderly parents (彩衣娛親). Liang Qichao, during his 1911 stay in Taiwan, composed 20 poems extolling the scenery at Laiyuan, which would late become known as \"Twenty Quatrains on Historic Laiyuan\" (萊園名勝十二絕句).

    "text": "The Uniform Monday Holiday Act (Pub. L. 90–363, 82 Stat. 250, enacted June 28, 1968) is an Act of Congress that permanently moved two federal holidays in the United States to a Monday, being Washington's Birthday and Memorial Day, and further made Columbus Day a federal holiday, also permanently on a Monday. This created long weekends with three days off ending with the holidays, such as Memorial Day Weekend.\nVeterans Day was moved from November 11 to the fourth Monday in October, but in 1978, it was returned to November 11, the actual date of the end of World War I and celebrated in several European countries as Armistice Day.\nThe Act was signed into law on June 1, 1968, and took effect on January 1, 1971.\n\nBackground\nThe Act was designed to increase the number of long weekends for federal employees, a favorite goal of the travel industry. Veterans Day was removed from this list of \"always-on-Monday\" holidays when it was moved back to its traditional date of November 11, by act of Congress in 1975, effective 1978.\nThis Act did not officially change the name of Washington's Birthday to Presidents Day, nor did it combine Washington's Birthday with Lincoln's Birthday, despite suggestions that those two changes be made. Many US states have adopted some version of the Presidents Day name.  The perception that the name was changed stems from the fact that the act placed federal observance of Washington's Birthday in the week of February 15 to 21 and, since that week always falls between Lincoln's birthday (February 12) and Washington's (February 22), but never includes either date, popular references have given rise to the title, which recognizes both Presidents. As of 1998, a dozen U.S. states officially refer to the holiday as \"Presidents' Day.\" Lincoln's Birthday holiday with very limited exceptions is no longer observed at all, at least on its actual date, though some states combine it with Washington's Birthday.\nThough the holiday was not in existence at the time, Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, which was established in 1983 and first observed in 1986, is celebrated on the third Monday in January, which falls on January 15–21, instead of King's actual birth date, January 15, for the same reasons.\n\nEffects\nThe Monday holiday dates this act established were:\n\nWashington's Birthday: third Monday in February (formerly February 22)\nMemorial Day: last Monday in May (formerly May 30)\nColumbus Day: second Monday in October (previously observed only in some states on October 12)\nVeterans Day: fourth Monday in October (was November 11 prior to the act and returned to November 11 in 1978)\nAlso celebrated on Monday:\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. Day: third Monday in January (first observed as a federal holiday in 1986)\nLabor Day: first Monday in September (first observed as a federal holiday in 1894. Already observed on a Monday prior to this Act)\n\nSee also\nHappy Monday System – similar legislation in Japan\nHoliday economics – similar policy in the Philippines\nTitle 5 of the United States Code\nTitle 36 of the United States Code\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\n\"Federal holiday provisions\".

    "title": "Astrid Hadad",
    "text": "Astrid Hadad (born 1957) is a Mexican singer and performer, mostly known for her irreverent political cabaret performances where she uses her own body as the scenic stage for all the symbols of Mexicanness (mexicanidad in Spanish) and excessive femininity through her costuming. Hadad was born in Chetumal, Quintana Roo, Mexico and currently lives in Mexico City. Of Mayan and Lebanese heritage, growing up near the Belize border and able to hear Caribbean radio stations coming from Cuba has been hugely influential on her heterogeneous perspective on social and cultural national life. Coupled with that, her incessant desire to critique the powers that be, her background as a political science major in college, her ongoing explorations in non-traditional theatrical forms, is all that fuels Hadad's unique political cabaret performances. As Roselyn Constantino has written, \"[o]ut of Hadad´s meditations on the multiplicity of influences shaping her and other Mexican's  [sic] sense of themselves, and on the violence implicity  [sic] in that process, emerge performances featuring a fast-paced, fragmented, parodic unveiling of traditional Mexican song, dress, and dance. Hadad avails herself of the humorous sociopolitical criticism of cabaret, carpa, and teatro de revista—important theatrical styles in Mexican cultural history.\"\n\nEducation\nBefore moving to Mexico City to attend the National Autonomous University of Mexico's Theatre School (Centro Universitario de Teatro), Hadad was enrolled at the Universidad Veracruzana where she was a political science and journalism major.\n\nEarly career\nAfter appearing in a number of theatrical shows, she came to the fore in 1985 in Donna Giovanni, an all-female adaptation of Mozart's opera, which was directed by Jesusa Rodríguez and became a hit in Europe. It closed after its 500th performance, in the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City. Also in the 1980s, a major television appearance was her role as Margarita in the Televisa-produced telenovela Teresa (1989), which starred fellow Mexican Lebanese actor Salma Hayek. In the early 1990s, Hadad was cast in the role of Teresa de Teresa in Alfonso Cuarón's first full-feature film, Sólo con tu pareja (Only With Your Partner), a film that, although lighthearted and comedic, includes AIDS in its story, something not openly discussed in the Mexican public sphere at that time. This multi-faceted set of experiences, coupled with Hadad's desire to interpret popular songs from the Latin American / Mexican songbook in her own particular way and her research interest in the history of German and French styles of cabaret and early twentieth century Mexican popular theater forms, like teatro de carpa (itinerant tent theater) and teatro de revista (revue theater), led to her explorations of political cabaret in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nEarly political cabaret performances and influences\nHadad's initial explorations into political cabaret were a result of the freedom she found within earlier forms of cabaret, both in form (due to its playfulness and mixture of music, voice/singing, and theater) and content (sexual permissiveness and political satire). But it was not about reproducing European modes of cabaret, Hadad was also interested in Mexican popular theater (teatro de carpa and teatro de revista), humor, and style to begin to create her particular mode of political cabaret. Some of her early political cabaret shows included: Nostalgia Arrabalera and Del Rancho a la Ciudad. Due to the interest and use of ranchera music in these, led to Hadad to produce and star in the tragicomic musical La Occisa or Luz, Levántate y Lucha based on the life of Mexican singer Lucha Reyes (1904-1944), a relatively famous ranchera singer, but who had gone into obscurity by the second half of the twentieth century. Hadad began to claim Reyes as the one who initiated the canto bravío (what later became ranchera music) in Mexico, but has not received this credit. Hadad states in an interview in 1997 \"traditionally women would sing the campirana song or bucolic songs with soft voices, with very high pitch. Women did not use the same force in singing compared to a man and Lucha (Reyes) is the one who initiates this type of ranchera singing in a bravía way among women. Because of that she changed the vernacular song\".  In addition to ranchera music, cabaret, teatro de carpa, and teatro de revista, films from the so-called golden age of Mexican cinema, especially the rumbera whose plots were set primarily in urban cabarets, were also highly influential in Hadad's visual and highly dramatic language. Lastly, Mexico's complex history of conquest and colonization, pre-Columbian iconography colonization, Catholic and religious syncretic symbols, historical figures, most specific women, and folk art, are all up for grab and form part of Hadad's universe in her political cabaret shows that are a mixture of music, song, dance, visual art, popular theater, satire.\n\nNotable political cabaret performances\nOut of the production La Occisa or Luz, Levántate y Lucha came Hadad's collaboration with the musical group that has accompanied her since, Los Tarzanes. Together, they have created various performances (La Mujer Ladrina, Apocalipsis Ranchero, La Mujer del Golfo, etc.).  In her Heavy Nopal show, Astrid makes use of iconic references, not just as scenery (the cactus, the rock, the pyramid, the tequila bottle), but also on her own body, becoming not only the stage, but also an altar. From the calla lilies to the extremely complex surprise-multi-purpose outfits to the innumerable ornaments, \"rebozos\", virgins of Guadalupe, guns, and common places in the essence of Mexico. Someone once described Astrid as a \"walking museum of popular cultures.\"\nPecadora is a comic show that has women as a central theme, using Mary Magdalene, sinner par excellence, as the leading thread. It is a show that aims at rescuing the passion from the dangers of extinction where it can be currently found. In it, Astrid retakes the spirit of the rumberas, the soul of the rancheras and the historical body of everything Mexican. Of course, all this seasoned with a loud wardrobe, where hearts, gigantic eyes, turquoise-blue dresses and an old lantern, among others, play before the eyes of the audience.\nIn Sol y Sombra, taking as an inspiration the novel Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Astrid presents a show where, setting the forces of evil against those of goodness, she leads us to reflect on (through her sense of humor) our inner ghosts as well as on the joys of life. This show boasts a colorful wardrobe and scenery, in which the use of \"papel picado\" is an important stage element. (\"Papel picado\" is a thin colored paper with different shapes cut out, used as a decoration on holidays in Mexico.) This show requires an arch-shaped structure to hang from as part of the scenery and the show. It is somewhat bulky to carry.\n\nThe last performance of the show called \"Oh-diosas\" (which is a play on words meaning something like \"bitchies / Oh - goddesses\") was at the end of the month of July 2006 in Mexico City, in one of the boroughs called Colonia Condesa.\nOther shows by Hadad include Corazón sangrante and La multimamada. “Corazon Sangrante” is a 40s-style bolero and rumba that Hadad wrote of the Aztec king Montezuma whose “heart was bathed in chile” after he was betrayed by Cortez. “Where can I go, where can I put heart, so it won't hurt, won't bleed...” she croons as she dances across the stage in a velvet gown adorned with golden pyramids, an outfit she describes as representing the syncretic nature (European and Indigenous) of Mexican culture.\nIf this sounds like a history lesson, it is, but it's hysterically funny. For her farewell number, she prances around the stage in a big sombrero with a moving rubber hand sticking up from the center. “Yes, this hand is for self-pleasure,” she quips, “It comes in three speeds.” The band picks up the tempo and Hadad reaches inside the brim to grab confetti, which she tosses into the air.\nAstrid has also starred in TV soaps and in the film Sólo con tu pareja.\nAstrid Hadad's discography includes recorded performances and singing.\n\nDiscography\n1990 - ¡Ay!

    "title": "Zone (play)",
    "text": "Zone is a French-language three-act play written by French-Canadian author Marcel Dubé. Written when Dubé was 21 and based on memories of his childhood, Zone revolves around a gang of teenaged Québécois criminals who sell contraband cigarettes, and the internal conflicts that ultimately tear the group apart.\n\nCast\nThe original production of Zone was directed by Robert Rivard and first released on January 23, 1953.\n\nMonique Miller as Ciboulette (chives)\nGuy Godin as Tarzan\nRobert Rivard as Passe-Partout (master key)\nRaymond Lévesque as Moineau (sparrow)\nHubert Loiselle as Tit-Noir\nMarcel Dubé as Johny\nJean Duceppe as Ledoux\nJean-Louis Paris as Police Chief\nYves Létourneau as Roger\nGeorge Hanigan as Andre (A)\n\nCharacters\nThe Love Interest (Ciboulette): Unloved by her parents, Ciboulette is the youngest group member at 16 years of age, and the only female in the play. She is in love with Tarzan but does not reveal this to him until the end. Her character's naïve hope for a relationship with Tarzan paired with her lust embodies the \"extreme idealism of youth\". Ciboulette's character is tragically punished for standing up for love.\nThe Leader (Tarzan): The leader of the group of contrabandists. A 21-year-old man who crosses the Canada–US border to retrieve cigarettes, and smuggles them into Québec to be sold. He falls in love with Ciboulette, but recognizes that they cannot really be together. Tarzan is the \"psychologically disturbed [victim] of circumstance\" whose façade of control disappears during his interrogation, where it is revealed that his real name is François Boudreau and that he is an orphan. Only in death does Tarzan realize that he is already condemned due to his birth into the proletariat class, and that he cannot escape his fate.\nThe Traitor (Passe-Partout): The traitor who accidentally leads the authorities to the abandoned warehouse where their stash of cigarettes is hidden, and who betrays Tarzan by telling the police that Tarzan crossed the US-Canada border the day a border-control officer was killed. It is revealed during his interrogation that his real name is René Langlois, and that he joined the group to provide food for his mother, because his father is an alcoholic who spends his salary on drinking. He has a sexual interest in Ciboulette, which complicates his relationship with Tarzan, as Tarzan is also in love with her. He is often seen as a realist in the play as he is the only one in the group that knows he is a criminal.\nThe Unimportant Guy (Tit-Noir): The group's accountant. It is revealed during his interrogation that his real name is Arsène Larue, and that he joined the group to obtain money for his future family and to study to become a priest. His nickname is \"Tit-Noir\" because when he was little, he had black hair, so his father called him \"Petit-Noir\", which eventually became \"Tit-Noir\". Tit-Noir serves a function similar to the messenger in Greek tragedy.\nThe 'Somewhat Slightly Less Intelligent' (Moineau): At the age of 20, he is the most artistic of the group. He often plays the harmonica, and joined the group so that he could become a musician. His name comes from the French word for sparrow, a humorous way of calling him a featherbrain. His lack of intelligence is clearly shown several times throughout.\nThe Truck Driver (Johny): The least seen of the gang, with only two lines. He drives the truck to the border with Tarzan. It is unclear whether he is a member of the group, or just a chauffeur.\nThe Old, Experienced Policeman (Chief Policeman): Only seen during the second act, when he interrogates the group. He cleverly causes every member to reveal something they did not intend to. He has a son around the age of Tarzan, which makes it harder for him to send him to jail.\n\"The New Guy\" Policeman (Ledoux): The detective who follows Passe-Partout to the hideout.\nThe Stereotypical Guard (Roger): A police officer who is present during the interrogations, and who shoots Tarzan, resulting in his death at the end of the play.\n\nSummary\nTarzan assembles a group of teenagers who, under the stress of their familial or economic situations, agree to sell cigarettes smuggled into Canada from the United States. Ciboulette, the youngest of the group and the only female, is in love with Tarzan, but does not reveal this despite Tit-Noir's urging, as she is worried it will ruin the business. Tarzan risks capture by crossing the Canada–US border with contraband cigarettes. While the others wait for Tarzan to return, Passe-Partout attempts to supplant as the gang's leader, and disobeys Tarzan's instructions by stealing a wallet from a passerby, who is actually a detective, Ledoux. Tarzan returns to the hideout but Ledoux arrives at the gang's hideout and arrests the teenagers with a police brigade.\nThe second act begins in the police station's interrogation room. Each member is questioned individually. During the interrogations, the police receive a call informing them that a border patrol guard was murdered earlier that day. The police chief interrogates Passe-Partout, who reveals that Tarzan had crossed the border that day. Under the impression that the other gang members have betrayed him, Tarzan confesses to the murder of the border guard.\nIn the third act, the group talks about what they will do to Tarzan at the prison, and how they will execute him. Later on, it is seen on the news that Tarzan has escaped from prison. He goes straight to the \"Hangar\" where they keep the cigarettes. The police had cleaned it out, so there was no longer anything and it was empty. Tarzan and Ciboulette ask the others to give them a moment so they step out. Tarzan and Ciboulette confess their love for each other and share a few kisses. Tarzan gives money to Ciboulette so she can have a better chance in life while she is saying to keep it for himself because he is going to need it to escape and get a better life for himself. He stays with Ciboulette until the cops come to get him and when he is shot, Ciboulette whispers things to him and holds him close.\n\nInspiration\nDubé based Zone in part on a past experience illegally crossing the Canada–US border.\n\nAnalysis\nZone takes place in a \"squalid\" environment, familiar territory for Dubé, whose works often dealt with the social disorder in French Canada at that time. The characters in Zone, trapped within the poverty of their social milieu, resort to \"adolescent ideals\" in an attempt to escape. Laroche suggests that the teenaged gang members are play-acting as the characters they saw in films. Dubé's characters reveal their deepest thoughts and feelings in their dialogue, reflecting their underlying helplessness. The irony is that the gang, who began engaging in criminal activities to escape the societal \"grey zone\" they inhabit, are ultimately punished by the same society that offered them no support. Although the characters in Zone work in a collective, they tear each other apart through internal rivalries and betrayal, rendering them incapable of standing up to society, represented in Zone by the police who interrogate the gang. It also deals with the complicated romantic relationship between a 21-year-old man, Tarzan; and a 16-year-old girl, Ciboulette.\n\nReception\nEdwin Hamblet criticized Zone for its \"sudden and perfunctory\" conclusion, finding that \"Dubé tends to have trouble in ending his plays\" and citing the artificiality of the plot twists. In 1953, Zone was awarded the Grand Prix for the best Canadian play at the Victoria National Drama Festival. Zone also won the Calvert, Sir Barry Jackson and Louis Jouvet prizes.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nHugo Therien (blog): Zone de Marcel Dubé",

Others are unique to the Sikh tradition, such as Waheguru, Akal Purakh, and Sarabloh. Employment of these terms does not mean Sikhs accept the religious context in which they are understood in their original sources. For example, the meaning of the words Hari or Ram as used by Sikhs does not mean the same thing as these terms do in the Hindu (particularity Vaishnav) traditions. Usage of these names does not mean Sikhs conceptualize their concept of God in the form of the incarnated devas or devis from Indic mythology, but rather they are used to describe various aspects of God as per Sikh theology. \nThe Sikh gurus adopted the names for the divine from various faith systems as they saw these sectarian differences in linguistics as unimportant in-comparison to the actual message they were trying to spread. On page 64 of the Guru Granth Sahib, various Islamicate terms for God are also presented freely.\n\nYour names are countless. I do not know their end, but I am sure that there is no one else like you.The Sikh Rehat Maryada produced by the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee proposes to use the term Akal Purakh as the paramount/formal Sikh term for God, despite there being variations of this name found in the compositions authored by Guru Nanak which were employed far more commonly than Akal Purakh (used only once by Nanak), with variations being Adi Purakh (used twelve times) and Karta Purakh (used three times). Furthermore, other terms for god, sourced from Arabic or Persian, that were used by Nanak were even more commonly used, such as Sahib (hundred-and-thirty-seven times), Khasam (seventy-eight times), or Patishah (twenty-three times).\n\nSee also\nNames of God in Hinduism\nNames of God in Islam\nNames of God in Christianity\nNames of God in Judaism\nNames of God in Zoroastrianism\nNaam Japo\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "Otrar",
    "text": "Otrar or Otyrar (Kazakh: Отырар [wotɤ̥ˈrɑr]; Old Turkic: 𐰚𐰭𐱃𐰺𐰢𐰣, romanized: Keñü Tarman), also called Farab, is a ghost town in southern Kazakhstan which was once a settlement located on the Silk Road. It was an important town in the history of Central Asia, situated on the borders of settled and agricultural civilizations. It was the center of a great oasis and political district, commanding a key point connecting Kazakhstan with China, Europe, the Middle East, Siberia and Ural.\n\nNames\nThe first known state in the region was known to Chinese scholars as Kangju, which was centered on the Syr Darya (also known as the Kang River). Kangju existed from the 1st century BC until the 5th century AD. Its capital was reportedly at or near Bityan. After being subject to several different waves of invaders, Kangju collapsed into several independent states situated mainly in the Syr Darya valley and its tributaries of Keles and Atysi.\nThere are records that portray the determination of earlier names of Farab. It is thought that a group of coins collected in Otrar and some towns of the oasis date back to the time of these records. There is a generic symbol of the Turgeshi in the form of a bow on the obverse of such coins and the image of a lion on the reverse side. On a second type of coin, there is an \"X\" sign on the reverse side; these may originate from the mint of a local ruler. There is a suggestion that the coins of the second type were minted by rulers of the Turkic state of Kangu Tarban, the population of which were the Kangars. According to the coins, in the 6th to 8th centuries, Kangu Tarban was ruled by a local dynasty of the Kangars, and their capital became a Tarban town named Turarband that was later to be called Otrar. Since the times of the golden hordes, the ruins of Otrar have been attractive because of rumours about the treasures of the ancient rulers, and about buried piles of gold coins and jewelry. The source of such legends was perhaps confirmed by the archaeological finds of various coins and jewelry.\nIn the 9th to the 10th centuries, various sources refer to Otrar as one of the Ispidjab towns. This is probably related to the fact that the city first submitted to the Caliphate and then to the Samanids. As before, Otrar remained the center of the district which occupied a space of \"about one day's journey in all directions\", which is many times mentioned by the chroniclers. The town is also known to have minted its own coinage. Otrar was the cultural center where Abu Nasr al-Farabi was born, and Aristan-Bab, an important representative of Islamic culture, preached here.\n\nLocation\nThe Syr Darya played a unique role in the life of Otrar and the whole region, and its waters were used for irrigation. They were also known for being abundant with fish and its shores were covered with rich vegetation and were also home to many birds and animals. Otrar is mentioned in numerous sources such as medieval Arab, Persian and Turkic authors. These sources refer to it as one of the Zhetysu (Seven Rivers) towns. The town was situated at the junction of different geographical landscapes and was at the intersection of the caravan routes of the Great Silk Road. Otrar, being at the junction of the two great rivers, was the center of the large agricultural region and, being near the foothills of the Karatau Mountains, became one of the supporting fortresses of the nomads wandering in the steppes. From Otrar, along the Arys, roads spread out to Taraz, Balasagun, and further on to Xinjiang; along the Syr Darya an old road went up to Shash, Sogd, and then to Merv and Nishapur, and another road went down to the Aral Sea and the Ural. Another well known road ran through the Kyzylkum desert moving westward to Khorezm and on to the Volga region, the Black Sea and the Caucasus.\nThe oasis of Otrar is situated in the Kusulkum district of the South Kazakhstan Province. It is 120 km northwest of Shymkent and 50 km from Turkestan. In fact, the disasters and wars that passed over the town have done their part. Now, at the site of the once-prosperous town, there remain only ruins overgrown with grass. A person who first comes to the Otrar oasis is often surprised by the appearance of the numerous stark ruins of towns and settlements, castles and watchtowers. The main irrigation channels are now crossed with dried fields and their cracked beds have not held water for centuries.\nThe oasis of Otrar is not one single site, but rather it is a large oasis containing a series of towns and cities. Each hill formed in the place of ancient settlements has, at present its own name: Altyntobe, Dzhalpak-tobe, Kuyuk-Mardan-tobe and Pchakchi-tobe. In earlier times, they had different names that are now forgotten and only the names of the three towns known in manuscript sources may be identified at the present ruins.\n\nHistory\nThe city has a history dating back to the time of the Achaemenid Empire, when it was known as Parab. The older Persian Pārāb (in Ḥudūd al-ʿĀlam) or Fārāb (also Fāryāb and Pāryāb), is a common Persian toponym meaning \"lands irrigated by diversion of river water\". (Fāryāb) also is the name of a province in northern Afghanistan.  By the 13th century, Fārāb on the Jaxartes was known as Otrār.\n\nMongols and Timurids\nThe prosperity of Otrar was interrupted by the Mongol invasion of Central Asia.\nIn 1218, a Mongolian trade caravan of around 450 men arrived in Otrar, including an ambassador of Genghis Khan. The governor of Otrar, Inalchuq, who was an uncle of Sultan Muhammad II of the Khwarazmian Empire accused them of being Mongolian spies and arrested them, and with the assent of Sultan Muhammed, executed the entire caravan.\nGenghis Khan responded by sending a delegation of three diplomats to Sultan Muhammad, demanding Inalchuq be punished; but Muhammad responded by beheading the Muslim ambassador and shaving off the beards of his two Mongol companions, provoking Genghis Khan into a retaliatory invasion. He besieged Otrar for five months in 1219, eventually breaching its walls and executing Inalchuq along with massacring the inhabitants.\nMany of the towns in the oasis never recovered and were abandoned. However, Otrar city rose again and during the troubled years of civil wars, which followed Genghis Khan's death, the town again became an important political and economic center. By the middle of the 13th century, it had returned as a large trade center on the way from the West to the East. During the second half of the 14th century Southern Kazakhstan was brought into the sphere of Timur's power. In February 1405, when Timur was visiting Otrar to gather his troops, he caught a cold and died in one of the Otrar palaces.\n\nUzbeks, Kazakhs, and Dzungars\nThe death of Timur led to more struggles, which resulted in Abu'l-Khayr Khan conquering several tribes and placing himself at the head of a new Uzbek Khanate. Other descendants of Genghis Khan had claims over the area as well, and so for most of the 16th and 17th centuries there was non-stop feuding among these various parties for power over the Kazakh Steppe and the Syr Darya valley, especially between the Kazakh Khanate and Dzungar feudal lords. Even so, a degree of stability was maintained in Otrar up until the Dzungars attempted and failed to conquer southern Kazakhstan.\nThese followed a prolonged period of revolt, which resulted in the economic decline of the area and its towns. As the Eurasian arm of the Silk Road gradually lost its importance, so did the city. Through the 17th and 18th centuries, the irrigation system slowly fell out of use, and the lower part of the Temir-aryk dried out.\nBy the end of the 18th century, there were only 40 families remaining in Otrar, compared to perhaps 5,000–7,000 in the 14th to 17th centuries, and the irrigated area had declined to about 5 square kilometres.[1]\n\nArchaeological findings\nThe area of the settlement is about 2 square kilometres. The lowest layers of the settlement are dated from the 1st century AD and the earliest monuments are dated from the 12th to 15th centuries. Otrar was a typical fortress for Central Asia. The Ark (central fortress) and Shahristan (fortified city) formed a five-corner hill about 18 meters of height. The area of the hill is 200,000 square metres. Excavations proved that it was an advanced town with monumental buildings. The town was densely populated: the houses stood close to each and formed the group of quarters or blocks. Two bath houses, dated by 9th to the 12th centuries, were found on the rabat (suburbs) outside the city wall. The baths had central halls for bathing and massaging, rooms for undressing, restrooms and a prayer room. They had hot water supply systems. Dishes excavated near two furnaces help prove that Otrar was the center of ceramic production in Central Asia. The ceramics had elements of decoration. One of the greatest artifacts was the figure of water carrier – a camel with a woman's head and cradle on its back.\n\nReferences\nThis article draws heavily from a UNESCO report.[2]\n\n^ a Division of Cultural Heritage, UNESCO Almaty Cluster Office, Aachen University (Germany). \"Central Asian Regional Training Course: CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND EARTHEN STRUCTURES AND SITES\".

    "title": "Lewis Overthrust",
    "text": "The Lewis Overthrust is a geologic thrust fault structure of the Rocky Mountains found within the bordering national parks of Glacier in Montana, United States and Waterton Lakes in Alberta, Canada. The structure was created due to the collision of tectonic plates about 59-75 million years ago that drove a several mile thick wedge of Precambrian rock 50 mi (80 km) eastwards, causing it to overlie softer Cretaceous age rock that is 1300 to 1400 million years younger.\nThe décollement can be seen from Marias Pass as a thin tan line of rock roughly halfway up Summit Mountain and Little Dog Mountain.\n\nGeography\nThe Canadian Rocky Mountain foreland thrust and fold belt is a northeastward tapering deformational belt consisting of Mesoproterozoic, Paleozoic, and Mesozoic strata. The Lewis thrust sheet is one of the major structures of the foreland thrust and fold belt extending over 280 mi (450 km) from Mount Kidd near Calgary, AB in the Southeast Canadian Cordillera to Steamboat Mountain, located west of Great Falls, Northwest Montana in the United States. The Lewis overthrust provides scientific insight into geologic processes happening in other parts of the world, like the Andes and the Himalaya Mountains.\n\nGeology and tectonics\nTectonic initiation and the Canadian Cordillera\nThe onset of Cordilleran orogenesis began in the Middle Jurassic time, as a result of the breakup of Pangea and North American plate motion toward subduction zones at the western margin. Most of the Canadian Cordillera today consists of numerous tectonostratigraphic terranes that were accreted to the stable margin of North America from the Jurassic to Early Tertiary as a result of eastward and northward drifting island arcs that collided with the continental lithosphere of North America. These terranes were accreted due to upper-crustal rocks being detached from the denser lower-crustal and proto-Pacific upper mantle lithosphere that was subducted under the North American craton. The allochthonous upper crustal terranes were juxtaposed over top of each other and over the western margin of the North American craton along a system of interconnected, northeast and southwest verging major thrust faults.\n\nRise of the Rockies and formation of the Rocky Mountain Thrust and Fold Belt\nThe onset of deformation of the Rocky Mountain fold and thrust belt was due to collisional tectonic forces that occurred on the west edge of the North American craton. This thrust and fold belt was uplifted east of the Canadian Cordillera and formed between the Middle Jurassic and Early Eocene within an easterly tapering wedge of Mesoproterozoic to early Cenozoic sedimentary rocks that were deposited in the Western Canada sedimentary basin. A profound unconformity separates the sedimentary cover from the Archean to Paleoproterozoic crystalline crust of North America. This thrust and fold belt has a thin skinned geometry as indicated by the array of thrust faults that interleave and overlap along strike and cut across strata at low to moderate angle that flatten with depth, repeat the same Cambrian to Triassic stratigraphy from thrust sheet to thrust sheet, and merge into a common basal décollement, the Rocky Mountain basal décollement. The Rocky Mountain thrust and fold belt propagated from west to east, accommodating up to 120 mi (200 km) of horizontal shortening near the Canada and US border, and about 43 mi (70 km) in northern parts of BC and Montana. The eastern boundary of the fold and thrust belt is marked by the easternmost deformed strata known in outcrop and or in the subsurface. Because strata underlying the Alberta plains is gently dipping, it is difficult to pinpoint the edge of deformation on this side of the belt. On the west side, the Rocky Mountains are bounded by the Rocky Mountain Trench, where the trench is interpreted to overlie the western, down-dropped blocks of major normal faults that separate the southern Rocky Mountains from the Purcell mountains.\n\nHorizontal shortening of the thin-skinned sediments lying above the detachment fault due to tectonic convergence must accommodate this horizontal shortening and has done so by the formation of major thrust faults with large displacement, the largest of which is the Lewis Thrust. The thrust sheets involved in the Canadian Rocky Mountain foreland thrust and fold belt consist of different aged strata indicative of significant deformation over time. The dominant structure of the deformational belt is a series of thrust faults, which are mostly listric and north-easterly or easterly verging. These thrust faults follow long bedding parallel detachments separated by ramps. As a result, a series of overlying thrust sheets is produced that follow their associated fault detachments. In addition, there is a westward dipping basal detachment that extends into the Cordilleran metamorphic core at mid-crustal levels. Strata from differing depositional environments is thought to have been scraped off of the under-riding North American craton and accreted to the over-riding Intermontane terrane during the Late Jurassic to Paleocene convergence of tectonic plates. Studies and modern dating have found that eastward propagation of thrusting took place in four distinct pulses that are separated by relative tectonic quiescence. 40Ar/39Ar dates indicate that these pulses occurred in the Late Jurassic (163-146 Ma), middle Cretaceous (103-99 Ma), Late Cretaceous (76-68 Ma), and late Paleocene- early Eocene (57-51 Ma), separated by quiescent periods of >40 Ma, >20 Ma, and >10 Ma respectively.\nThe Rockies were uplifted during the Laramide Orogeny which occurred between 80 and 55 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous to the Early Paleocene as a result of subduction of the Kula and Farallon plates beneath the North American continent. Furthermore, the first radiometric ages obtained from direct dating of thrust-fault gouge from the front ranges of the southern Canadian Rockies identified two distinct deformation episodes named the \"Rundle pulse\" and the \"McConnell pulse\". These pulses were dated and are interpreted to have occurred at 72 Ma and 52 Ma respectively.\n\nLewis thrust system\nThe Lewis thrust Is a low-angle thrust fault in which Precambrian sediments have been thrust over younger Cretaceous sediments. The thrust sheet is constrained by lateral ramps on either side. In the south this occurs near Marias Pass, Montana, where the ramp geometry is parallel to the direction of sheet movement. In the north, the thrust sheet is forced up and over an oblique ramp near the Kootenay Pass region in British Columbia. The overall shape of the thrust sheet as it moved north-eastward has a general convex shape towards the foreland.\nThe Lewis sheet is carried by the Lewis thrust fault where the compression and thrusting (in the southern Canadian Rocky Mountains Foothills and Eastern Front ranges) was associated with oblique, right-hand convergence between the Intermontane terrane and the North American craton. This transpression in the Late Cretaceous led to the tectonic inversion of the Cordilleran miogeocline and the Belt-Purcell basin as the Lewis sheet began to buckle and fold, where strata was then overturned until a break or fault was formed. This involved thick successions of Paleozoic rocks that make up the Corilleran miogeocline and the underlying Neoproterozoic rocks to become detached from the crystalline basement; displaced up the passive-margin ramp along which they had accumulated; and juxtaposed over the flat surface of the North American craton to form the structural culmination that defines the Main Ranges of the Canadian Rockies. Similarly, the thick succession of Mesoproterozoic strata consisting of the Belt-Purcell supergroup followed the same sequence of events leading to the structural culmination seen in the southern end of the Purcell anticlinorium.\n\nThe Lewis thrust is cut by two major extensional fault systems, the Flathead fault and the Rocky Mountain trench fault system. Both of which are late Eocene to Miocene in age. However, the amount of shortening that has taken place on the thrust is not connected to Eocene extension due to the Rocky Mountain trench fault system and the Flathead fault having no influence positionally on the footwall and hanging wall cutoffs of the Lewis thrust. Instead, this transpression was replaced with transtension in the early Eocene involving east–west crustal extension and tectonic exhumation, which brought up mid-crustal metamorphic rocks to the surface to be exposed. Additionally, this transition from transpression to transtension resulted in rapid cooling of the metamorphic core complexes as they were exhumed and brought to the surface. Dextral transtension on intracontinental strike-slip faults in northeastern and southwestern British Columbia culminated with the mid Eocene extensional exhumation of midcrustal metamorphic core complexes. This leads to the basal décollement being exposed and the association with north–south faulting, dyke emplacement, and voluminous magmatism, which in turn, marked cessation of crustal shortening. Paleotemperatures and geothermal gradients indicate that the Lewis thrust sheet was 7.5–8.4 mi (12–13.5 km) thick when thrusting commenced.\n\nDuplexes\nThrust faults often associate three types of structures, imbricate fan structures, ramp-flat structures, and duplex structures, all of which are seen within the Lewis thrust and the Rocky Mountain thrust and fold belt. Duplex structures are common and have been located in numerous locations along the Lewis thrust. These structures are distinct due to their structurally overlapping, lenticular stacked thrust fault slices. A prime example is seen in an area that extends from the Kootenay Pass north of the border to Marias Pass found in Montana. This section shows the Lewis Thrust following a series of bedding-parallel detachment horizons with a fairly thin stratigraphic interval near the base of the Purcell Supergroup, which is also the base of the mid-Proterozoic belt. Two windows in this section showing exposures of Upper Cretaceous strata exposed beneath the Lewis Thrust occur adjacent to the Flathead Fault. Within these windows, the Lewis thrust is folded along with overlying and underlying strata in a series of northwest-trending anticlinal culminations that extend the length of the west side of the salient. Furthermore, two distinct structural levels can be seen in this section, an upper level comprising the majority of the mass of the Lewis thrust sheet which is characterized by broad open folds in relatively undeformed rocks, and a fairly thin lower level consisting of stacked imbricate, southwest-facing, sigmoidal thrust fault slices, bounded below by the Lewis thrust, and above by a separate bedding-parallel thrust called the Tombstone thrust. These culminations progressively stack up and accommodate significant lateral crustal shortening associated with the compression along the Lewis thrust fault. Another extremely similar section of this duplexing is seen at another outcrop in the Waterton Lakes area in Southwest Alberta. In addition to duplexes seen in windows, the Lewis thrust also shows isolated remnants of the eastern edge of the upper plate( klippes) located at Chief Mountain in Montana and Crowsnest Mountain in Alberta. Erosion over time has shaped the mountains into their characteristic shape, where they tower over the associated prairies.\n\nGeochronology\nThe fault motion of the Lewis thrust is dated based on the oldest age for motion being defined by the youngest sediments on the footwall, which are said to be about 65 million years old. Fission track analysis of Uranium-bearing minerals such as Zircons and Apatite which involves dating the radioactive uranium found in sediments along the Lewis thrust using isotopic ratios of Uranium provides constraints of the late pre-deformational paleogeothermal gradient and thickness of the Lewis sheet. This data, after being calibrated into geologic ages, led to the conclusion that maximum burial and heating in the Lewis thrust occurred during the Campanian over a time interval of less than 15 million years prior to the start of movement of the thrust sheet. The Apatite fission track data showed abrupt change in paleotemperatures from high to low temperatures and associated changes in uranium concentrations as burial and heating came to a halt and movement and exhumation began, which showed that displacement of Mesoproterozoic strata of the Belt–Purcell Supergroup along the Lewis thrust fault was in motion by approximately 75 Ma. This is supported by locations further south along the thrust fault in Montana where faults on the leading edge cut through a 76 Ma volcanic marker proving that the onset of fault movement must be younger than 76 Ma.\nThe Youngest movement along the fault or in other words, the end of movement for thrust movement is based on the stratigraphic and structural characteristics of early Eocene deposits and is limited by the age of normal faults that cut the thrust and the associated sediments found within these normal faults. Additionally, The cooling of the metamorphic core complexes that arose and were exhumed is said to mark the end of deformation of the thrust belt which was done by using radiometric Uranium in zircons to provide a cooling age that is consistent with tectonic transition from compression to extension.  U-Pb dating of zircons from various deformed and crosscutting mid-crustal granitic rocks in south-central British Columbia provided cooling ages of 59 Ma. Furthermore, the transition from thrusting and folding to crustal stretching led to rapid cooling of the Priest River metamorphic core complexes where cooling ages found in biotite gave ages of >55 Ma through K-Ar and 40Ar/39Ar dating methods. In addition, the same faults in Montana that cut a volcanic marker were also found to be cut by 59 Ma porphyry dikes. This limits the youngest age for movement to have occurred at 59 Ma. Together, dates revealed for oldest and youngest movement along the fault place the overall movement of the Lewis thrust fault to have occurred over a span of about 15 Ma in the Late Cretaceous to Early Paleocene periods between 75 and 59 Ma.\nPaleotemperatures have been derived from vitrinite reflectance by measure of the percentage of incident light reflected from the surface of vitrinite particles in a sedimentary rock from the Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous formation along the Lewis thrust. Results yielded the pre-deformational paleogeothermal gradient to a range of <30 to 11 °C/km compared to 18–22 °C/km during peak coalification and maximum temperatures. These results are indicative that the Lewis thrust sheet succession was overlain by at least 3 km of additional Late Cretaceous strata, along with the 8 km thick succession indicating that the Lewis thrust sheet had an approximate thickness of 12–13.5 km prior to thrust movement.\n\nGeologic movement\nGeophysical methods in the form of seismic analysis has also been used to determine movement along the thrust sheet. In one study, seismic data recorded along the 49°N parallel (the border between Canada and the US) was recorded from the Rocky Mountain trench fault in the foreland belt to the east flank of the Moyie anticline of the Purcell anticlinorium, which is thought to be the location where the Lewis fault tapers off. Seismic data produced showed total displacement of 115 km of the Lewis thrust sheet. This was done by locating the position of the footwall cutoff of the Lewis sheet which is interpreted in the seismic section as truncated reflectors at 11–15 km depth underlying the Purcell anticlinorium and overlying the basement reflectors. 75 km East along the profile is the exposure of the Lewis fault in the Waterton area, which directly links to the most displaced portion of the hanging wall. Measuring the distance between the footwall cutoff and the fault exposure at the Earth's surface, total movement of the Lewis thrust sheet was determined. Results showed that there was 75 km of direct movement of the thrust sheet along the Lewis fault, and an additional 40 km of transport by the formation of footwall-domain duplexes. Although this study did not take into consideration that it could be possible that the Lewis thrust sheet moved further east along the prairies and was eroded away, the data proved to be of high quality as it allowed excellent ties to be made to previous drill holes, mapped structures, measured stratigraphy, and existing geologic and seismic data. This study acted as a reinforcement to previous work and was very consistent with previous data collected. Additionally, this seismic data presented is significant in extensional terms as a direct link between reflectors on the West and East sides of the Rocky Mountain trench correlate to the same stratigraphic unit, where extension can be restored and an extensional distance of about 10 km was calculated by the difference of the pre extension and post extension.\nThere is controversy over how the overthrust movement occurred and the effect this movement had on the surrounding geology. More specifically, attempting to determine if the thrust movement was continuous or if movement was subject to a more stick-slip style of movement remains inconclusive. However, the anomalously high vitrinite reflectance values obtained from the Lewis thrust at Marias Pass, the McConnell thrust at Mt. Yamnuska, the Coleman fault at Wintering Creek and several others indicate temperatures of 350–650 °C were generated during thrusting. Furthermore, these high vitrinite reflectance values were restricted to extremely narrow sections adjacent to and within the fault zones. This is indicative that the high temperatures were fairly short-lived. Thus, the high temperatures are interpreted to be the result of frictional heating during stick slip faulting. Evidence for the local high temperatures within the fault zone indicate that local areas of frictional stress must have existed, with the possibility of this occurring due to ramps in the fault plane where drainage of high pore pressures may have occurred. Moreover, samples from the hanging wall collected in close proximity to the fault plane show no evidence for heating during progressive burial of sediments. This absence of evidence for heating during faulting is indicative of low frictional stress and therefore, low rates of slip. This shows solid agreement with the evolution of the Canadian Rocky mountain foreland thrust and fold belt, including the Lewis thrust sheet which has been interpreted to have developed and commenced movement in pulses.\n\nReferences\n\n\"Geology Fieldnotes: Glacier National Park, Montana\".

    "title": "Poigai Alvar",
    "text": "Poigai Alvar  was one of the twelve Alvar saints of South India, who are known for their affiliation to Vaishnava tradition of Hinduism. The verses of Alvars are compiled as Nalayira Divya Prabandham and the 108 temples revered are classified as Divya Desam. Poigai is one of the three principal Alvars, with the other two being Bhoothath Alvar and Peyalvar, collectively called Mutalamalvargal, who are regarded to be born out of divinity. Poigai composed hundred verses that are classified as Mutal Tiruvantati, and his composition is set in the antati style, in which the ending syllable is the starting one for the next verse.\nAccording to traditional account, the first three Alvars belong to Dvapara Yuga (before 4200 BCE). As per Hindu legend, Poigai was found in a small pond near the Yadhotakaari temple at Tiruvekkaa. In Tamil, small pond is called poigai, and since he was found in a pond, he got the name Poigai.\nAs per legend, the three Alvars were once confined in a small dark enclosure during a rain in Thirukovilur and they experienced a fourth individual among them. They found out that it was god Vishnu and Poigai Alvar wished to see his face continuously but could view only from the simmering light of the lightning. With a view to maintain the continuity of light, he instantly composed hundred songs wishing light to emerge. The other two continued composing hundred songs each on Vishnu. The works of these earliest saints contributed to the philosophical and theological ideas of Vaishnavism. Along with the three Shaiva Nayanmars, they influenced the ruling Pallava kings of the South Indian region, resulting in changing the religious geography from Buddhism and Jainism to the two sects of Hinduism.\n\nAlvars\nThe word Alvar means the 'immersed', referring to the poet-saints's deep devotion to their supreme deity, Vishnu. The Alvars are considered the twelve supreme devotees of Vishnu in Sri Vaishnavism, who were instrumental in popularising Vaishnavism during the 5th to 8th centuries CE. The religious works of these saints in Tamil, songs of love and devotion, are compiled as Naalayira Divya Prabandham, containing 4000 verses, with each of the 108 temples revered in their songs is classified as a Divya Desam. The saints had different origins, and belonged to different classes. According to tradition, the first three Alvars, Poigai Alvar, Bhoothath Alvar, and Pei Alvar, were born miraculously. Thirumalisai Alvar was the son of a sage, Thondaradi Alvar, Mathurakavi Alvar, Periya Alvar, and Andal were from Brahmin varna, Kulasekhara Alvar from the Kshatriya varna, Nammalvar from a cultivator family, Tirupana Alvar from the Tamil Panar community, and Tirumangai Alvar from the Kalvar community.\nDivya Suri Saritra by Garuda-Vahana Pandita (11th century CE), Guruparamparaprabavam by Pinbaragiya Perumal Jiyar, Periya tiru mudi adaivu by Anbillai Kandadiappan, Yatindra Pranava Prabavam by Pillai Lokacharya, commentaries on Divya Prabandam, Guru Parampara (lineage of Gurus) texts, temple records and inscriptions give a detailed account of the Alvars and their works. According to these texts, the saints were considered incarnations of some form of Vishnu. Poigai is considered an incarnation of Panchajanya (Krishna's conch), Bhoothath of Kaumodaki (Vishnu's mace), Pey of Nandaka (Vishnu's sword), Thirumalisai of Sudarshanam (Vishnu's discus), Namm of Vishvaksena (Vishnu's commander), Madhurakavi of Vainatheya (Vishnu's eagle, Garuda), Kulasekhara of Kaustubha (Vishnu's necklace), Periya of Garuda (Vishnu's eagle), Andal of Bhudevi (Vishnu's wife, Lakshmi, in her aspect as Bhudevi), Thondaradippodi of Vaijayanti/Vanamalai (Vishnu's garland), Thiruppaan of Srivatsa (An auspicious mark on Vishnu's chest) and Thirumangai of Sharanga (Rama's bow). The songs of Prabandam are regularly sung in several the Vishnu temples of South India daily and also during festivals.\nAccording to traditional account by Manavala Mamunigal, the first three Alvars, namely, Poigai, Bhoothath and Pey belong to Dvapara Yuga (before 4200 BCE). It is widely accepted by tradition and historians that the trio are the earliest among the twelve Alvars. Along with the three Saiva nayanmars, they influenced the ruling Pallava kings, creating a Bhakti movement that resulted in changing the religious geography from Buddhism and Jainism to these two sects of Hinduism in the region. The Alvars were also instrumental in promoting the Bhagavata cult and the two epics of India, namely, Ramayana and Mahabharata. The Alvars were instrumental in spreading Vaishnavism throughout the region. The verses of the various Alvars were compiled by Nathamuni (824-924 CE), a 10th-century Vaishnava theologian, who called it the \"Tamil Veda\".\n\nEarly life\nPoigai was found in a small pond near the Yadhotakaari temple at Tiruvekkaa.  In Tamil, a small pond is called a poigai, and since he was found in a pond, he got the name Poigai. At Kanchipuram there is a temple inside the Deva-sarovara lake. This temple enshrines an idol of Saroyogi in a recumbent posture with eyes closed in meditation. From childhood, Poigai was deeply devoted to Vishnu. He mastered all the Vaishnava speeches, and followed the Vaishnava tradition. He was variously known as Ayonigi, Saro-yogi, Kasara-yogi, Poigai-piraan, Saravora Munindra and Padma-muni.\n\nKanchi derives its name from Brahma, who is known as Ka; who worshipped God in this kshetram. In that famed city, in a lotus flower within a lotus pond, under the star Thiruvonam (Sravanam) which is the star of God Himself, Poigai was born. He gave the wonderful Mutal Tiruvantati pasuram, which is like a lamp that drives away the darkness of the mind and elevates the soul.\n\nComposition\nAs per Hindu legend, Vishnu appeared to the Mutal Alvars (first three Alvars) at Thirukkoilur. It was day time, but it darkened and started raining heavily. The wandering Poigai Alvar found out a small hide out, which has a space for one person to lie down. Bhoothath Alvar arrived there looking for a hiding place and Poigai Alvar accommodated him, with both sitting together. In the meanwhile, Pei Alvar also came to the same place as all the three preferred to stand because of lack of space. The darkness became dense and inside the small room, they were not able to see each other. In the meanwhile, they felt a fourth person also forced his way among them. The three Alvars realised from the light of the lightning that the fourth one had a charming face that was sublime and divine. The trio could immediately realize that it was Vishnu who was huddling among them. Poigai Alvar wished to see Vishnu's face continuously, but could view only from the simmering light of the lightning. With a view to maintain the continuity of light, he instantly composed hundred songs wishing the earth to be a big pot full of ghee like an ocean where the sun could be the burning wick.\n\nDeeming in the world as bowl, the full sea as ghee, the fierce-rayed sun as a luminous wick, I have twined a garland of speech for the feet of Him who wields the red flaming discus so that there may be freedom from the ocean of misery.\n\nThe song is also interpreted as the Alvar praying to god to remove the darkness and ask for his unlimited knowledge and power. Bhoothath Alvar also sang 100 songs imagining to light the lamp constantly through ardent love for him. Peyalvar sang another 100 songs, where he described the enchanting charm of the divine face and the association of Narayana equipped with chakra and sankha, and his divine consort, the goddess Lakshmi.\nPoigai composed hundred verses that are classified as the Mutal Tiruvantati. Poigai's composition was set in the antati style. The word anta means end, and adi means beginning. The antati style has ending word or the syllable of each verse as the beginning word of the succeeding verse and the last word of the hundredth verse becomes the beginning of the first verse, making the hundred verses a true garland of verses. The works of these earliest saints contributed to the philosophical and theological ideas of Vaishnavism. The verses of the trio speak of Narayana (another name for Vishnu) as the supreme deity and they refer frequently to Trivikrama and Krishna, the avatars of Vishnu.\n\nWorship\nThere is a shrine dedicated to Poigai in the Yathothkari Perumal Temple tank called Deva Sarovaram where his image is depicted in reclining posture. Poigai has revered Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple in one, Thirupaarkadal in one, Tirumala Venkateswara Temple in ten, Thiruvikrama Perumal Temple in two, Vaikuntha in two and Tiruvekkaa in four verses. Alvar Utsavam is a festival celebrated annually during the birth date of the saint based on Tamil calendar in the Yathothkariswami temple at Tiruvekka.\n\nMangalasasanam\nThere are 20 of his pasurams in the Naalayira Divya Prabhandham. He has sung in praise of six temples.\n\nNotes\nReferences\n\n\n== External links ==",

    "text": "Great Rocks Dale is a dry valley in the Derbyshire Peak District, known for its extensive quarrying.\n\nGeography and geology\nThe valley runs from Peak Dale down to Blackwell Mill at Chee Dale on the River Wye.\nThe scenery is of limestone, which extends to a depth of around 380 metres.  It contains the only dikes in the White Peak. Boreholes have enabled the extraction of significant amounts of water, used by local industry.\nBefore the quarrying, the southern part of the valley was described as \"narrow, flat-bottomed, rocky... [with] almost perpendicular cliffs of limestone on either side...\", whereas the northern part was broader and grassy.\n\nHistory\nThe dale fell within the bounds of the mediaeval Forest of High Peak.  The surrounding land was first farmed in about 1250, by people connected with the nearby hamlet of Tunstead.\nIn 1867, an extension of the Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway was opened, running through the valley between Peak Forest and Millers Dale. This section of line remains open, for freight traffic, now known as the Great Rocks Line after this area.\n\nThe valley is now dominated by Tunstead Quarry, a large limestone quarry, worked since 1929.  Given its economic importance, the boundary of the Peak District National Park was carefully drawn to exclude the dale.  By 1973, Tunstead was the largest quarry in Europe, and permission to extend it into the National Park was rejected on the grounds that there was sufficient stone to last until at least 2000.  Following a Public Inquiry and a High Court case, the Secretary of State ultimately overrode the National Park Authority's decision and granted permission for a 148.57-hectare (367.1-acre) extension within the Peak District National Park. It remains the largest producer of limestone in the Peak District, with about 5.5 million tonnes extracted each year.\nIn 1932, quarrying opened a fissure which contained remains of bison, Irish elk and deer, washed down from the surface in the distant past.  In 1957, the painter Peter Lanyon visited the valley to study the faces of the quarry, seeing them as revealing both the geological and human history of the area.\n\nSee also\nBuxton lime industry\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "Josephine Leavell Allensworth, also known as Josie Allensworth (1855–1938), was an American musician, music teacher, and activist. \nShe co-founded Allensworth, California with her husband, after a series of events, including the Great Depression and World War II, there was a wave of residents who moved out of the area. Allensworth was a small town on 40 to 50 families in 1985. About 240 acres of Allensworth land was used to create a California State Historic Park called Colonel Allensworth State Historic Park.\n\nPersonal life\nJosephine Leavell was born in Trenton, Kentucky, in April 1855. She married Allen Allensworth in 1877. He was an African-American Baptist minister in the United States Army. President Grover Cleveland appointed him as chaplain. He served in 24th Infantry Regiment, one of the Black Regiments. He was the second Black man in the United States Army to be a commanding officer.\nThey had two daughters, Eva (born January 1880) and Nella (born October 1881). The family lived in Fort Supply, Oklahoma, and Fort William Henry Harrison in Montana. Leavell played the organ when Allensworth hosted services. Allen was a private aide to William Howard Taft. The Allensworths lived in San Francisco in 1900. Allen Allensworth retired from the Army with the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1906.\n\nAllensworth\nAllen and Josephine founded Allensworth, California, a place for Blacks to live free of discrimination in a town that they governed. Land for the town was purchased because it was inexpensive old farm land that had artesian wells. It was also located near the Santa Fe Railroad line. Ranchers, farmers, skilled workers, teachers, and business people were lured to the town in south Tulare County, California.\nSeveral events led to the closing of the town. Allen, who was the leader of the town, died in an accident in 1914. Over time, the town experienced a shortage of water. The Great Depression and World War II drew people to places with greater opportunities. More people left when three of the town's wells were found to have arsenic in 1965. Wishing to maintain the historic town, supporters lobbied to make the area a park. Governor Ronald Reagan signed the legislation to make a park from some of the land in 1973. There is still the small town of Allensworth, in 1985, there were about 40 to 50 families living there. A grant provided the funding for a 10,000 gallon holding tank for water.\nAbout 240 acres from Allensworth was used to create the California State Historic Park, Colonel Allensworth State Historic Park, which became part of the state park system in 1973. It was updated in 1985 from funding attained from historic development section of the California Parks and Recreation Facilities Act of 1984.\n\nWomen's Improvement League\nWhile living in Allensworth, Leavell founded the Women's Improvement League. She also provided the land for the founding of the Mary Dickinson Memorial Library. The founding of the library developed out of a library being approved by the Allensworth Board of Trustees. The reading room they approved was too small for the community. Leavell therefore created the property to develop more land for a larger library. The library is named after her mother and was completed in July 1913. The building of the library cost $500. It could hold 1,000 books. The Allensworths donated their personal book collection to the library. She was also a school board member.\n\nLater years and death\nAllen Allensworth was hit by a motorcyclist in Monrovia, California. He died at the hospital on September 14, 1914.\nIn 1922, Leavell moved to Los Angeles to live with her daughter, Nella, who was married to Louis Blogett. As a resident in Los Angeles, Leavell fought for racial integration in swimming pools and other venues. Leavell lived in Los Angeles until her death in 1938.\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nBunch, Lonnie. \"Josephine Leavell Allensworth.\" Black Women in America: A Historical Encyclopedia.

    "text": "St Patrick's are a Gaelic Athletic Association club located in Chapelizod and Palmerstown, South Dublin.\n\nHistory\nThe club was founded in 1961 and took its name because that was the Patrician year. The club colours came about as one of the founders, Peter Kavanagh, had two sets of jerseys, one green and the other red. Originally the main colours were to be green and white (the colours of Saint Patrick and the shamrock) but because neighbouring clubs Round Towers and Lucan Sarsfields used green and white, it was decided to use red and white and keep the green as second colours.\nThe first match to ever take place was the U13’s against Round Towers of Clondalkin which John Daly (founder and current club President) refereed. The match took place in a field where the Assembly Hall and St Brigid's School currently stands today.\nThe first championship won was U16 1/2 football in 1966. St Patrick's have traditionally been stronger in football but in recent times have enjoyed more success on the hurling front. St Patrick's won the Dublin Junior Hurling Championship for the first time in 1998. The club gained Senior hurling status for the first time in 2004 when they lifted the Dublin Intermediate Hurling Championship. In 2008 they lifted the Dublin Senior B Hurling Championship, thus gaining promotion to the Dublin Senior Hurling Championship.\nIn the same season, the St Patrick's footballers lifted the Dublin AFL Division 3 title resulting in promotion to Dublin AFL Division 2. More success was to follow in 2009 for the footballers as they won the Dublin Intermediate Football Championship and gaining promotion to the Dublin Senior Football Championship.\nMost recent success has come in winning the 2013 Dublin AHL Division 2 and promotion to the Dublin Senior Hurling League.\n\nAchievements\nDublin Senior B Hurling Championship: Winners 2008\nDublin Intermediate Football Championship: Winners 2009\nDublin Minor B Football Championship Winners 2006\nDublin Intermediate Hurling Championship: Winners 2004\nDublin Junior Hurling Championship: Winners 1998\nDublin Junior B Hurling Championship: Winners 1995, 2021\nDublin Senior Hurling League Division 2 Winners 2013\n\nPlayers\nLiam Rushe\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nSt Patrick's GAA website",

It is primarily composed of ungulates and herbivores, such as Arabian antelopes. It also holds oryx, eland, gazelle, and lechwe, as well as the rare white lion and Nubian giraffe.  There are 68 species of mammals, 88 species of birds and 35 species of reptiles available in the 50 hectares of zoo houses.\n\nHistory and fauna\nIn 1968 Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the late Ruler of Abu Dhabi and President of the United Arab Emirates joined efforts and decided on founding a national zoo. This decision was born out of their genuine concern of the land's wildlife. In 1969 it was established by Shaikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan and in 1972 it opened to the public. Among the species they wanted to protect were ungulates such as the Arabian oryx.\nToday, the zoo hosts over 4,000 animals, some of them extinct in the wild, some endangered. It features a big cat house containing lions, mountain lions, jaguars, black panthers, leopards, and cheetahs. In addition, it has a reptile house, monkey compounds, an aquarium, and an aviary. From February 2010 until July 2010, the Al Ain Zoo hosted the \"Dinosaur Trail,\" a small section that includes around 15 to 20 mechanical dinosaurs with sensors, such as Tyrannosaurus rex. It included information about each dinosaur, living habits, natural habitat and basic features. \nIn April 2019 the zoo began its expansion program in order to build new compounds' areas and sites, such as the conservation and breeding centres, African Safari, World Desert Zoo, and the Sheikh Zayed Desert Learning Centre.\nIn March 2022, as the zoo intended to import wild African elephants from Namibia, the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums published its thoughts on the matter. They stated that according to their Code of Ethics it is essential from time to time to make such actions. This is needed in light of global efforts of conservation breeding programs, education programs, or basic biological studies. Having said that, they continued their statement that concluded that the zoo's intention to import African elephants does not meet WAZA's Code of Ethics. The outcome of that statement was the decision to terminate Al Ain Zoo membership in WAZA until further notice.\nFollowing that event and statement, on September 15, 2022, the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) also announced the termination of the membership of Al Ain Zoo in the United Arab Emirates. The zoo’s membership ended on December 31, 2022, following the decision of the EAZA Council that EAZA can no longer reasonably be expected to allow the institution to remain a member. The decision comes after careful examination of evidence related to importing wild-caught African elephants from Namibia, which the Council agreed constituted multiple breaches of EAZA Codes and Standards. \nOn August 14th it was reported that for the first time in years three Arabian sand cats were born in the zoo.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nAl Hefaiyah Conservation Centre\nDubai Dolphinarium\nDubai Safari Park\nDubai Zoo\nEmirates Park Zoo near Abu Dhabi City\nSir Bani Yas in the Western Region\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Al Ain Zoo at Wikimedia Commons\nOfficial website",

    "text": "Eric Genrich ( GHEN-rik; born October 8, 1979) is an American politician who has served as the mayor of Green Bay, Wisconsin, since 2019. Genrich previously represented Green Bay in the Wisconsin State Assembly from 2013 until 2019.\n\nEarly life and education\nBorn in Green Bay, Wisconsin, Genrich graduated from Notre Dame Academy in 1998. He went on to attend the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he majored in history and sociology, earning his bachelor's degree in 2002. He earned a Master of Library and Information Science from the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee in 2010.\n\nCareer\nAfter graduating from the University of Wisconsin, Genrich was employed for six years as a legislative aide to State Senator Dave Hansen. He was subsequently employed as a district representative for Congressman Steve Kagen. After Kagen left office in 2011, Genrich was employed as an IT librarian at the Brown County Library, where he worked until his election to the Assembly in 2012.\n\nWisconsin Legislature\nThe 2011 Wisconsin gerrymander (2011 Wisc. Act 43) significantly altered the political makeup of the Wisconsin's 90th Assembly district, removing suburban Howard and Suamico, and packing in more of Green Bay's population. In March 2012, 90th district incumbent State Representative Karl Van Roy announced he would not seek re-election in the new district, Genrich announced his candidacy for the seat a month later.\nGenrich would defeat Republican activist and businessman David VanderLeest in the 2012 general election, taking 60.2% of the vote. He was subsequently re-elected in 2014, defeating attorney Eric Wimberger, and was unopposed in 2016.\nGenrich, as a Democrat, served in the minority during his six years in the Wisconsin State Assembly. He was a member of the committees on education, on energy and utilities, on insurance, on regulatory licensing reform, and on science and technology.\n\nMayor of Green Bay\nIn March 2018, he announced his candidacy for mayor of Green Bay in the 2019 election, in a bid to replace Jim Schmitt, who was not seeking another term as mayor. Genrich and Brown County Supervisor Patrick Buckley advanced from a primary election, and Genrich defeated Buckley with 57.1% of the vote.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Mayor Genrich was one of several Wisconsin mayors and politicians who sought alternative voting accommodations to comply with COVID-19 lockdown procedures. Genrich and the city of Green Bay filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin about two weeks before the April 7 elections, stating that they did not have the capacity to carry out the election as directed, and asking for an injunction to delay the election until June. The suit was quickly dismissed by the court, which said it lacked jurisdiction to rule on the matter. A subsequent order from Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers to postpone the election also fell in the Wisconsin Supreme Court. The election went forward as scheduled on April 7, though with less than 10% of their normal election workers. Brown County Clerk Sandy Juno offered to allocate Wisconsin National Guard personnel to manage polling stations, but Green Bay (along with other neighboring municipalities) refused, citing a lack of training. As a result of the personnel shortages, Green Bay could operate only 2 of their 31 in-person polling locations and endured long lines of voters waiting to cast their ballots.\n\nPersonal life\nGenrich and his wife, Emily (née Kelley), live on Green Bay's east side with their two children, Amelia and Henry.\n\nElectoral history\nWisconsin Assembly (2012, 2014, 2016)\nGreen Bay Mayor (2019, 2023)\nReferences\nExternal links\nCampaign website\nProfile at Vote Smart\nEric Genrich at Ballotpedia\nAbout the Mayor at Green Bay, Wisconsin\nRepresentative Eric Genrich at Wisconsin Legislature\nState Representative Eric Genrich (Archived October 31, 2018)",

    "title": "Mecistocephalus glabridorsalis",
    "text": "Mecistocephalus glabridorsalis is a species of soil centipede in the Mecistocephalidae family. This centipede is found in Seychelles. This species features 49 pairs of legs and can reach 85 mm in length.\n\nDiscovery\nThis centipede was first described in 1900 by the Austrian myriapodologist Carl Attems. He based the original description of this centipede on two specimens, an adult male and a juvenile. These specimens were found on the island of Mahé in Seychelles.\n\nTaxonomy\nAttems originally described this centipede as a subspecies of Mecistocephalus punctifrons. In 1902, the Swiss zoologists Henri de Saussure and Leo Zehntner elevated M. glabridorsalis to the rank of species. Some other authors, however, continued to deem this centipede a subspecies or a junior synonym of M. punctifrons. Authorities now regard M. glabridorsalis as an accepted species.\nIn 1981, the French myriapodologist Jean-Marie Demange described M. vanmoli as a new species based on specimens found on the island of Mahé in Seychelles. In 2010, the Italian biologists Lucio Bonato and Alessandro Minelli deemed M. vanmoli to be a junior synonym of M. glabridorsalis. Consequently, some references regard M. vanmoli as a junior synonym, but other references list M. vanmoli as an accepted species.\n\nDescription\nThe species M. glabridorsalis features 49 leg-bearing segments and can reach 85 mm in length. The body is mostly yellow with some dark pigment on the dorsal surface of the trunk, but the head and anterior segments are reddish brown. The head is about 1.6 to 1.9 times longer than wide. The dorsal surface of the head features a transverse frontal line that is uniformly curved. Each antenna is about four or five times longer than the head is wide. The areolate area on the anterior part of the clypeus is about as long as the smooth areas on the posterior part of the clypeus (plagulae). This areolate area features about four pairs of setae arranged in a transverse row, but with the middle pair usually posterior to the others. The pleurites on the sides of the head (buccae) feature setae only on the posterior half. Each mandible can feature up to 16 or 17 pectinate lamellae (comb blades). The anterior corners of the coxosternite of the first maxillae are pointed and project forwards. The claw on each of the second maxillae narrows abruptly into a tip that is usually rounded.\nThe first article of the forcipule features a small proximal tubercle and a large but obtuse distal tooth that points out from a wide base rather than forwards. The second and third articles of the forcipule each feature a small tubercle, with the tubercle on the third article larger than the one on the second. The base of the ultimate article of the forcipule features a small tubercle. The sterna of the leg-bearing segments feature a longitudinal groove in the middle that divides into branches that form an acute or right angle with one another. The sternum of the last leg-bearing segment is shaped like a trapezoid that is wider than long and features a notch on each lateral margin.\nThis species exhibits many traits that characterize the genus Mecistocephalus. For example, like other species in this genus, M. glabridorsalis features a head with a transverse frontal line, a coxosternite of the first maxillae that is divided down the middle by a suture, and an undivided coxosternite of the second maxillae. Furthermore, like other species in this genus, M. glabridorsalis features a head that is evidently longer than wide, buccae with setae, second maxillae with claws, and a longitudinal groove on the trunk sternites.\nThis species shares a more extensive set of traits with another species in the same genus, M. punctifrons, with which M. glabridorsalis has often been confused. For example, each of these species features 49 leg pairs, a frontal line on the head that is uniformly curved, and a forked longitudinal groove on the trunk sternites. Furthermore, in both species, the anterior corners of the coxosternite of the first maxillae are pointed and project forwards.\nThe species M. glabridorsalis can be distinguished from M. punctifrons, however, based on other traits. For example, the forcipule in M. punctifrons features two developed teeth on the first article, with the proximal tooth only slightly smaller than the distal tooth, developed teeth on the second and third articles, and two small basal teeth on the ultimate article, whereas the forcipule in M. glabridorsalis features only a small proximal tubercle and a distal tooth on the first article and only one small tubercle on each of the other articles. Furthermore, the anterior half of the buccae features setae in M. punctifrons but not in M. glabridorsalis. Moreover, the sternite of the last leg-bearing segment features a posterior projection shaped like a pillow in M. punctifrons but features lateral notches instead in M. glabridorsalis.\n\nDistribution and ecology\nThe species M. glabridorsalis has been recorded not only in Seychelles but also on the island of New Guinea, on the island of Seram in the Maluku Islands in Indonesia, and in the Bismark Archipelago in Papua New Guinea. In Seychelles, this species has been found not only on the island of Mahé but also on the islands of La Digue, Praslin, and Silhouette. Authorities express doubts about reports of this species from localities outside Seychelles and suggest that these records require confirmation. This centipede has been found primarily in woodland soil at elevations between 20 meters and 1,500 meters.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "Rimini Proclamation",
    "text": "The Rimini Proclamation (Italian: Proclama di Rimini) was a proclamation by Joachim Murat, King of Naples, calling for the establishment of a united, self-governing Italy ruled by constitutional law. Its text is widely attributed to Pellegrino Rossi, later Papal Minister of Interior under Pope Pius IX. While it is primarily considered as a desperate attempt from Murat to retain the Neapolitan throne, the Rimini Proclamation was among the earliest calls for Italian unification. \nThe Rimini Proclamation is dated to 30 March 1815, when Murat's army was passing through Rimini in the Neapolitan War against the Austrian Empire, though it may have been published only after Murat's defeat at the Battle of Tolentino in May 1815. The citizens' address begins with the call:\n\nItalians! The hour has come to engage in your highest destinies.\n\nBackground\nThe Kingdom of Naples, which ruled the southern half of the Italian peninsula, was a client state of Napoleon Bonaparte's French Empire. In 1808, Napoleon named Joachim Murat as King of Naples; Murat had married Caroline Bonaparte, Napoleon's younger sister, in 1800. The northern half of the Italian peninsula was divided by the French Empire and, from 17 March 1805, the Kingdom of Italy, another French client state, with Napoleon as King of Italy.\n\nBy January 1814, Napoleon was losing the War of the Sixth Coalition, in which a coalition of European states fought against the French Empire and its client states. On 11 January 1814, the Kingdom of Naples and the Austrian Empire signed the Treaty of Naples, under which Murat defected to the coalition. As part of the treaty, Murat would keep the Neapolitan throne in return for sending 30,000 troops against the Kingdom of Italy. Murat's troops passed through the city of Rimini, at the southern tip of the Kingdom of Italy, on 1 February 1814.\nFollowing further military defeats, Napoleon abdicated on 6 April 1814. At the Congress of Vienna, Klemens von Metternich, Austria's Foreign Minister, was bound by other coalition allies that wanted to restore Ferdinand IV of the House of Bourbon to the Neapolitan throne, particularly Britain.\nWith his throne no longer secure, following Napoleon's return from exile, Murat switched sides in an unsuccessful attempt to return to Napoleon's favour. On 15 March 1815, the Kingdom of Naples declared war on the Austrian Empire, starting the Neapolitan War. With an estimated 45,000 troops, the Neapolitan army invaded the Papal States, Tuscany, and the Marche. Though the Austrian army in northern Italy numbered 94,000 troops, it was widely distributed. On 30 March 1815, Murat's troops arrived in Rimini, where they were hosted by the Battaglini counts. In a final attempt to gain allies, Murat published the Rimini Proclamation.\n\nContents\nThe Rimini Proclamation consists of two documents: one addressed to soldiers and one addressed to citizens. The proclamation is often identified as the latter address to citizens. Most scholars attribute the text of the addresses to Pellegrino Rossi, later Papal Minister of the Interior under Pope Pius IX.\nThe citizens' address begins with the call:\n\nItalians! The hour has come to engage in your highest destinies. Providence ultimately calls you to be an independent nation. From the Alps to the Strait of Scylla, you hear a single cry: \"The independence of Italy!\" And under what title do foreign peoples claim to take away this independence, the first right and first good of every people?\nThe proclamation references Italy's physical geography – \"the barriers of the Alps\" and \"inaccessible seas and mountains\" – as evidence of Italy's call to independence. It compares Italy's subjection to \"England, that model of constitutional rule, that free people, who goes to glory to fight\". It calls on the \"good and unhappy Italians of Milan, Bologna, Turin, Venice, Brescia, Modena, [and] Reggio\" to \"come together in firm union\" for \"a Constitution worthy of the century and of you\".\nIn its desire for independence and constitutionalism, the proclamation was written to inspire liberal elites in northern Italy.\n\nAftermath\n400 volunteers joined Murat's army on 30 March 1815. Murat's eastern column advanced northwards from Rimini towards the River Po, entering Bologna on 2 April, while the western column reached Florence on 8 April. On the same day, the eastern column engaged 3,000 Austrian soldiers at the Battle of Occhiobello. Following its defeat at Occhiobello, it was pushed southwards, leading to Murat's decisive defeat at the Battle of Tolentino on 2–3 May. Murat returned to Naples on 18 May, where Caroline had already surrendered to the British, and fled immediately to southern France.\nHearing of Napoleon's defeat at the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815, Murat fled to Corsica, from which he attempted an impossible invasion of Calabria. Napoleon remarked: \"Murat attempted to reconquer with 200 men that territory which he failed to hold when he had 80,000 at his disposal.\" Murat was captured, sentenced to death, and shot by firing squad in Pizzo Calabro on 13 October 1815.\nIn Il re lazzarone (1999), Risorgimento scholar Giuseppe Campolieti hypothesises that the Rimini Proclamation was only published on 12 May 1815, after Murat's defeat at Tolentino, and backdated to 30 March.\n\nLegacy\nThe Rimini Proclamation is primarily considered a desperate attempt from Murat to retain the Neapolitan throne. Nevertheless, and somewhat ironically for a French king, it was among the earliest calls for Italian unification and independence. The proclamation impressed poet Alessandro Manzoni, who wrote a song entitled Il proclama di Rimini , but he left it unfinished after Murat's campaign failed.\n\nSee also\n(in Italian) Text of the proclamation on Italian Wikisource\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "Élie-Franck Okobo (born 23 October 1997) is a French professional basketball player for AS Monaco of the French LNB Pro A and the EuroLeague. A 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m) tall combo guard, the Bordeaux native began his club career at age 16. Okobo subsequently competed for the youth team of Élan Béarnais Pau-Lacq-Orthez, reaching the LNB Espoirs title game in 2016. In the 2016–17 season, he assumed a greater role with the senior team, and in the following year, he became a regular starter.\nOkobo has represented France at international competition on multiple occasions. He was a key player for the under-20 team at the FIBA Europe Under-20 Championship, which he took part in twice, winning a bronze medal in 2017. Okobo has also suited up for the senior national team at FIBA World Cup qualification. He has been considered one of the top international prospects, and at one point was considered a potential first-round selection, for the 2018 NBA draft. However, he was taken as the 31st overall pick in the second round by the Phoenix Suns that year.\n\nEarly life and career\nOkobo was born in Bordeaux, France to a Congolese father and French mother. He has one sister and two brothers: his older brother plays handball and competes in track and field, while his younger brother also plays basketball. In addition, Okobo's father has basketball experience as well.\nAt age 16, Okobo joined JSA Bordeaux Basket of the Nationale Masculine 1 (NM1), the amateur level third-tier division of French basketball. He made his senior men's club debut on February 8, 2014, shooting 0-of-1 from the field in one minute of playing time against Basket Club Montbrison. He scored his only points of the season, on March 8 versus JA Vichy-Clermont Métropole, with 2 points. In four contests, he averaged 0.5 points and 0.3 steals per game, in 2.2 minutes per game.\nIn the 2014–15 season, Okobo began playing for Espoirs Pau-Lacq-Orthez in the LNB Espoirs youth league. In his debut on September 20, 2014, he chipped in 23 points and 4 steals as his team lost to Espoirs Châlons-Reims. On December 23, he scored a season-high 24 points, shooting 6-of-7 from the three-point line, in a 79–78 win over Espoirs Nancy. After 29 games, Okobo averaged 9.8 points, 3.0 rebounds, 1.9 assists, and 1.2 steals per game.\n\nProfessional career\nÉlan Béarnais (2015–2018)\nYouth success (2015–16)\nOn June 13, 2016, Okobo signed a three-year contract with Élan Béarnais Pau-Lacq-Orthez of the LNB Pro A, the highest professional division of France. Through the 2015–16 season, he primarily played with Espoirs Pau-Lacq-Orthez in the youth league, seeing limited minutes for the senior team in the Pro A. On October 6, 2016, Okobo opened his second LNB Espoirs campaign by recording 17 points, 5 rebounds, and 8 assists in a 102–56 victory against Espoirs Monaco. He made his Pro A debut for Pau-Orthez on October 24, 2015, grabbing one rebound in a minute versus Paris-Levallois. On March 25, 2016, Okobo erupted for 34 points and 10 rebounds, both season-bests, in a youth league win over Espoirs Le Havre. In the following week against AS Monaco Basket, he scored 5 points—his first and only of the Pro A season. By the end of the season, Espoirs Pau-Lacq-Orthez had the best record in its league, at 29–5, but lost in the championship game to Espoirs Paris-Levallois. In the youth league season, Okobo averaged 15.5 points, 4.4 rebounds, 3.2 assists, and 2.2 steals per game.\n\nIncreased role (2016–17)\nIn the 2016–17 season, Okobo played sparingly in LNB Espoirs, instead receiving significant minutes off the bench for Pau-Orthez in the Pro A. On September 24, 2016, he made his season debut in the Pro A, recording 5 points, 2 rebounds, and 2 assists against Cholet Basket. In his second appearance of the LNB Espoirs season, Okobo posted a double-double of 21 points and 12 rebounds on October 15 versus Espoirs Gravelines-Dunkerque. On October 25, he debuted in the FIBA Europe Cup, the fourth-tier inter-continental European competition, notching 6 points and 2 rebounds in a win over Tartu. Later in the week, Okobo had another double-double in the LNB Espoirs, adding 18 points and 13 assists, along with 6 rebounds, against Espoirs Orleans. On November 28, he scored 11 points in a 96–76 loss for his first career double-digit scoring effort in the Pro A.\nOkobo recorded a season-high 20 points, 6 rebounds, 10 assists, and 1 turnover in a 101–66 victory over JIP Pardubice in the second round of the FIBA Europe Cup on December 13. He had another notable performance on January 24, 2017, against Alba Fehérvár, scoring 10 points and hitting a game-winning three-pointer with under 10 seconds left to send his team to the FIBA Europe Cup Round of 16. He scored 8 points in the fourth quarter alone, with starting point guard D. J. Cooper being ejected in the final minutes of the game. On February 5, 2017, Okobo scored a season-best 15 points, with 5 rebounds and 4 assists, in a Pro A win over Élan Chalon. He closed the season averaging 4.6 points, 2.1 rebounds, and 1.5 assists per game in the Pro A, and 8.2 points, 3.3 rebounds, and 2.1 assists per game in the FIBA Europe Cup. Okobo was the runner-up for the LNB Pro A Best Young Player award, which was won by Frank Ntilikina of SIG Strasbourg.\n\nBreakout season (2017–18)\nIn his first game of the 2017–18 season, Okobo made his starting lineup debut in the Pro A on September 23, 2017, chipping in 14 points and 8 assists to help defeat Élan Chalon. On October 7, he led all scorers with 21 points and 3 steals against HTV Basket. Okobo had another notable performance on December 10, posting a team-high 23 points in a win over Levallois Metropolitans. He once again eclipsed the 20-point barrier on February 3, 2018, versus ASVEL Basket, scoring 24 points to lead Pau-Orthez to victory.\nOn February 10, Okobo scored a career-high 30 points, along with 8 assists and 4 rebounds, in a 105–93 win over Élan Chalon. The performance earned him Player of the Week honors from the website Eurobasket.com. He announced plans to enter the 2018 NBA draft on April 11, saying, \"I'm progressing every day and I see how I'm continuing to improve. I am very happy with the training I have received at Pau-Lacq-Orthez, and I know I will improve even more with NBA conditions and NBA training.\" At the time, ESPN considered him to be a possible first-round selection, and three weeks later, analyst David Aldridge projected him as a late first-round or early second-round prospect. With Pau-Orthez, Okobo reached the playoffs as the eight-seed. On May 23, during Game 1 of the series against first-seeded Monaco, Okobo scored a career-high 44 points in a 99–97 loss. That game would help Okobo's draft stock rise from a likely second round pick to a potential mid-first round selection. At the June 11 international draft day deadline, Okobo would be one of only 11 truly international prospects to remain in the 2018 NBA Draft. Okobo would later be taken as the 31st pick by the Phoenix Suns ten days later.\n\nPhoenix Suns (2018–2020)\nOn June 21, 2018, Okobo was drafted with the 31st pick in the 2018 NBA draft by the Phoenix Suns. It was around this time that the franchise's general manager, Ryan McDonough, mentioned that Okobo would be playing with the official, 15-man roster for the team this season. Three days after the draft, it was reported the Okobo would agree to a four-year deal worth $6 million, with his third and fourth years being team options. Okobo would then be announced as a player for the Suns' 2018 NBA Summer League squad. He would officially sign the aforementioned deal on July 6. In his NBA debut on October 17, Okobo recorded two points and an assist in a 121–100 win over the Mavericks. On October 28, Okobo recorded 18 points, 5 rebounds and 7 assists in a 117–110 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. Three days later, Okobo made his first start in the NBA, recording eight points, four rebounds, and five assists in 28 minutes of action in a 120–90 loss to the San Antonio Spurs. On November 13, 2018, Okobo was assigned to the Northern Arizona Suns, playing for the team the same night in a loss against the Santa Cruz Warriors, and continued to play with both Phoenix and Northern Arizona throughout 2018. His highest scoring game in his rookie season occurred on November 28, scoring 19 points in a 115–99 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. On February 2, 2019, Okobo recorded a season-high 11 assists in a 118–112 loss against the Atlanta Hawks. Okobo was later assigned to Northern Arizona once again on March 14, returning to Phoenix just a day later. He was waived by the Suns on November 25, 2020.\nOn December 16, 2020, Okobo was signed by the Brooklyn Nets. He was waived at the conclusion of training camp.\n\nLong Island Nets (2021)\nOn January 27, 2021, Okobo was included in the roster of the Long Island Nets. Over 14 games with Long Island Nets, he averaged 8.9 points, 5 assists and 3.4 rebounds per game.\n\nASVEL (2021–2022)\nOn July 10, 2021, Okobo signed a one-year deal with French powerhouse ASVEL of the LNB Pro A and the EuroLeague. On February 2, 2022, he was ruled out for six weeks after undergoing surgery on a shoulder cyst.\nOkobo helped ASVEL win its 21st LNB Pro A championship and was named the Finals MVP, after helping the team defeat Monaco 3–2 in the league Finals. He scored 20 points, 7 rebounds and 9 assists in the decisive Game 5 overtime win.\n\nAS Monaco (2022–present)\nOn July 15, 2022, he signed with AS Monaco of the LNB Pro A. On April 22, 2023, Okobo won the French Basketball Cup with Monaco, the first in the team's history. He was named the Cup Final MVP after he had 20 points, 6 rebounds and 7 assists in the final against his former team ASVEL.\nIn the 2024–25 EuroLeague, Okobo and Monaco advanced to the final of the Final Four, becoming the first French team in 32 years to reach the European final. In the final, however, Monaco lost to Fenerbahçe to finish as runners-up.\n\nNational team career\nOkobo was a member of the French under-20 national basketball team, making his first international appearance at the 2016 FIBA Europe Under-20 Championship in Finland. He had his best performance of the event on July 23, 2017, notching 23 points, 7 rebounds, and 4 steals in a 74–60 victory over Finland. He was the third-leading scorer at the tournament, averaging 18.9 points, 3.9 rebounds, 1.6 assists, and 1.9 steals per game, shooting .429 from the three-point line. He also played with France's Under-20 junior national team, at the 2017 FIBA Europe Under-20 Championship, where he won a bronze medal. He averaged 12.3 points, 3.3 rebounds, and 4.0 assists per game at the tournament.\nHe represented France at EuroBasket 2025, leading the French team with 5.0 assists per game to the round of 16.\n\nCareer statistics\nNBA\nRegular season\nEuroLeague\nFIBA Europe Cup\nDomestic leagues\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nCareer statistics from NBA.com · Basketball Reference\nElie Okobo at lnb.fr at the Wayback Machine (archived April 8, 2018) (in French)\nÉlie Okobo at FIBA.basketball\nÉlie Okobo at FIBA.com (archived)\nÉlie Okobo at EuroLeague\nÉlie Okobo at Eurobasket.com\nÉlie Okobo at DraftExpress.com\nÉlie Okobo at ESPN.com\nÉlie Okobo at RealGM\nÉlie Okobo at Proballers\nÉlie Okobo – Basketball-Reference.com NBA G League player profile\nÉlie Okobo – Basketball-Reference.com international player profile\nÉlie Okobo on Instagram",

    "title": "Ethnosymbolism",
    "text": "Ethnosymbolism is a school of thought in the study of nationalism that stresses the importance of symbols, myths, values and traditions in the formation and persistence of the modern nation state.\nDeveloped as a critique of modernist theories of nationalism, ethnosymbolism emphasizes historical roots of nations in drawing on ethnic symbols, myths, values and traditions inherited from earlier ages. Like the modernists, and in contrast to primordialists, ethnosymbolist scholars agree nationalism is a distinctly modern phenomena.\nThe term was first used as \"ethno-symbolist approach\" in an article by Daniele Conversi, Smith's former student at the London School of Economics. However, Conversi was slightly critical, arguing: \"if we focus exclusively on the power of the past and its symbols, we miss two other key features of nationalism: first, its relationship with political power, and particularly with the state; second, its crucial border-generating function\".\nJohn A. Armstrong, Anthony D. Smith and John Hutchinson are commonly regarded as key theorists of ethnosymbolism.\n\nImportant theorists\nJohn A. Armstrong\nArmstrong's contribution to ethnosymbolism is his “myth-symbol complexes” in Nations before Nationalism (1982), which firstly underlined the significance of la longue durée, according to Anthony D. Smith. Armstrong believes that ethnic consciousness can far back in ancient civilisations such as Egypt, and that nationalism is merely \"the final stage of a larger cycle of ethnic consciousness reaching back to the earliest forms of collective organization\". Therefore, similar to the longue durée of Annales School, formation of ethnic identity should be examined across a timespan of many centuries.\nDrawing on the work of Fredrik Barth, Armstrong argues that \"groups tend to define themselves not by reference to their own characteristics but by exclusion, that is, by comparison to 'strangers'\". In other words, the character of a group is never fixed, and in accordance with group member's individual perceptions the boundaries of identities vary. Armstrong contrasts this to modern nationalist thought, which \"has sought permanent \"essences\" of national character instead of recognizing the fundamental but shifting significance of boundaries for human identity\". Despite these pursuits, Armstrong maintains that, historically, \"persistent group identity did not ordinarily constitute the overriding legitimization of polity formation\".\nNonetheless, for Armstrong, \"myth, symbol, communication and cluster of associated attitudinal factors are usually more persistent than purely material factors\", indicating his emphasis on the persistence of symbolic boundary mechanisms. He specified and analysed several factors that ensure such persistence.\nThe first such factor, also the most general one, is ways of life and the experiences associated with them. There are two fundamentally different ways of life: the nomadic and the sedentary. The second factor is religion, exemplified by Christianity and Islam, both of which gave birth to different civilizations and myths/symbols. The third factor is city formation, whose effect upon ethnic identification requires examination of a host of factors ranging from the impact of town planning to the unifying of centrifugal effects of various legal codes, especially the Lübeck and Magdeburg law. The fourth factor is the role of imperial polities in maintaining myth-symbol complexes across dispersed geographical spaces. The final factor is language. Uniquely, Armstrong concludes that \"the significance of language for ethnic identity is highly contingent\" in the pre-modern era. Its significance relied on political and religious force and allegiances for centuries.\nIn his later works, Armstrong more explicitly agreed with modernists like Benedict Anderson and Eric Hobsbawm that national identity had been an invention, although he maintained an emphasis on \"the antiquity of some inventions and the repertory of pre-existing group characteristics that inventors were able to draw upon\".\n\nAnthony D. Smith\nA former student of the prominent modernist Ernest Gellner, Anthony D. Smith developed a distinct perspective from his teacher, best exemplified in the so-called \"LSE debate\" on nationalism (named by Gellner). Smith argues the \"modern state cannot be understood without taking pre-existing ethnic components into account, the lack of which is likely to create a serious impediment to 'nation-building\". Smith believed the definitions of \"nation\" and \"nationalism\" offered by both modernism and primordialism were limited. For him, the problem of modernism is mainly that modernists define nation as \"modern nation\" with characters of European nations of 18th and 19th centuries, making their definition Eurocentric and partial. Instead, Smith proposes an \"ideal-typical\" definition of the nation: \"A named human population sharing an historic territory, common myths and historical memories, a mass, public culture, a common economy and common legal rights and duties for all members\". Smith also introduces the important term ethnie, meaning \"ethnic group\", which is used to describe pre-modern ethnic communities. Ethnies contain six main attributes:\n\na collective proper name\na myth of common ancestry\nshared historical memories\none or more differentiating elements of common culture\nan association with a specific \"homeland\"\na sense of solidarity for significant sectors of the population\nAccording to Smith, there are four main mechanisms of ethnic self-renewal:\n\nreligious reform, as exemplified in the history of Jews\ncultural borrowing, exemplified with encounter between Jewish and Greek cultures\npopular participation, exemplified with the socio-religious popular movement of the Mazdakites in 5th-century Sassanid Persia undermining the foundations of the Sassanid state\nmyths of ethnic election, the lack of which might be related to the diminishment of ethnic survival of Assyria, Phoenicia and the Philistines\nIn order to understand why and how a nation emerges, Smith posits two types of ethnic community: the lateral (aristocratic) and the vertical (demotic). Lateral communities are usually made up of aristocrats and elites. For example, the Normans were united by shared myths of descent and the achievements of their dukes, but this identity was limited to the upper classes. On the other hand, vertical communities are more inclusive and connect different social classes through shared culture and history. For instance, the Israelite community united various social groups with common religious and historical traditions. In later works, Smith added a third type: immigrant nations that consist of the fragments of other ethnies, such as the United States and Australia.\nAccording to Smith there are three ways in which the past may influence the national present:\n\nThrough the recurrence of the nation-form. The concept of the nation, Smith tells us, refers to a type of cultural resource and of human association that is potentially available in all periods of human history.\nThrough established continuities. Continuity can be found in \"collective proper names, language codes and ethnic landscapes, all of which may linger on, even after the community to which they were attached has all but vanished\". These components may also provide the framework for the revival of the community in a new form. Smith refers to the Greeks as a good example of this revival through continuity of names, language and landscapes.\nThrough appropriation and reinterpretation - exemplified in the tendency of later generations to rediscover, authenticate, and appropriate aspects of what they consider to be ‘their’ ethnic past.\n\nJohn Hutchinson\nJohn Hutchinson was a PhD student of Smith's at the London School of Economics. Hutchinson's primary contribution to ethnosymbolism is the theory of cultural nationalism, developed in the Dynamics of Cultural Nationalism (1987).\nHutchinson separates nationalism into \"political nationalism\" and \"cultural nationalism\", which are different, even competing conceptions of the nation, and \"have sharply diverging political strategies\". Political nationalists are essentially cosmopolitan rationalists whose conception of nation \"looks forward ultimately to a common humanity transcending cultural differences\". Although the fact that the world has been divided into multiple political communities has forced them to work within existing borders, political nationalists' objectives are to \"secure a representative state for their community so that it might participate as an equal in the developing cosmopolitan rationalist civilization\".\nIn contrast, cultural nationalists believe humanity is \"infused with a creative force which endows all things with an individuality\" similar to nature. They regard the state as accidental, since for them a nation is essentially a distinctive civilisation, \"the product of its unique history, culture and geographical profile\". Nations are organic entities and living personalities. Hutchinson contests that cultural nationalism hardly draws attention from theories of modernism.\nNot only has he challenged modernism in his earlier works, he has also engaged postmodernism in his more recent works, especially in Nations as Zones of Conflict (2005).\n\nCriticism\nThomas Hylland Eriksen says it is misleading to claim there is an unbroken continuity from pre-modern cultures to national ones.\nSimilarly, Walker Connor and John Breuilly criticize ethnosymbolists for conflating ethnic groups and nations. Breuilly argues it is impossible to know from the evidence what meaning ethnic sentiments had for the majority of the people in the pre-modern era, going on to note how, unlike modern nations, many pre-modern identities lack an institutional basis through which national identity achieves form.\nBreuilly is also skeptical of anachronistic readings of cultural materials from the past, explaining how nationalist\nintellectuals and politicians seize upon myths and symbols in order to promote a particular national identity. Indeed, in many cases, he argues nationalists simply invent myths or ignore contrary evidence. Furthermore, in contrast to the ethnosymbolist emphasis on early symbols, myths, values and traditions, Breuilly states there are many nationalist movements that have succeeded without having a rich ethnohistory to feed upon.\nUmut Özkirimli and Spyros Sofos criticize the unproblematic relationship between nations and ethnies posited by Smith, suggesting that ethnosymbolist thinking is marked by \"retrospective ethnicization\". That is, scholars \"ethnicize\" a complex, contradictory and ambiguous past, packaging together disparate cultural and social traditions, often unrelated to each other, using the notion of ethnie. They argue that nations are defined by nationalists who also retrospectively construct these ethnies - \"collections/collations of cultural practices established over time or invented, and forged together often arbitrarily, according to the judgement or needs of nation-builders—politicians or romantic folklorists, musicologists, educationalists and so on—most often the product of retrospective legitimation of the very processes that have underpinned nationalist projects\".\nCraig Calhoun argues that tracing continuity in ethnic traditions does not explain which traditions last or which will become the basis for nations. He emphasizes how traditions are not simply inherited, but reproduced, adapted to new circumstances to keep them meaningful, which may change meanings considerably.\n\nFurther reading\nMaxwell, A.

    "title": "Mundelsheim",
    "text": "Mundelsheim (German pronunciation: [ˈmʊndl̩shaɪm]) is a municipality in the German state of Baden-Wuerttemberg. It is located in the Ludwigsburg district, about 30 km north of Stuttgart and 20 km south of Heilbronn, on the Neckar river. It belongs to the Stuttgart Metropolitan Region.\n\nHistory\nAround the time of Christ's birth around the Neckar valley was populated by the Celts. With the Roman invasion, the area was incorporated into the Roman Empire. From the reign of the Roman remains of a Mithraic temple testify on the grounds of the industrial area Ottmarsheimer Höhe. This temple belonged to an extensive Roman settlement, which has been studied since the 1990s there at securing excavations of Antiquities and Monuments Office of the state Baden-Württemberg. A Roman villa has been discovered during the construction of the federal motorway 81.\nIn 500 AD, began the rule of the Alemanni was an Alemannic nobleman named Mundolf, who gave the place its present name: \"Mundolfsheim\" what was in the language changed over the centuries to \"Mundelsheim\". In 1245 the place \"Mundelsheim\" was first mentioned in records. After the disintegration of the Duchy of Swabia the community came into the possession of the Margrave of Baden. This gave him the 13th Century the Lords of Urbach fief. In 1422 Emperor Sigismund Mundelsheim awarded municipal law. The Lords of Urbach participated in many robberies on traveling merchants. Therefore, the imperial cities of Heilbronn and Schwäbisch Hall moved in 1440 before with an army of 600 men on horseback against Mundelsheim and destroyed the community.\n1595 Mundelsheim was sold to the House of Württemberg. Until 1806 was Mundelsheim seat of an urban district that came up first in the rural district office Beilstein and then in the rural district office Marbach. When this was dissolved in 1938 in the course of municipal reform, the community fell to the rural district of Ludwigsburg, where it now belongs.\n\nReligion\nWhile the Reformation had prevailed in the neighboring municipalities of Württemberg since 1534, the Baden districts such as Mundelsheim and Besigheim did not follow suit until much later. After the Peace of Augsburg in 1555, Margrave Karl II of Baden-Durlach implemented a uniform creed in his domain and introduced the Protestant faith in 1556. Today the Protestant parish of Mundelsheim belongs to the parish of Marbach.\nThere is also the Catholic parish of St. Wolfgang in Mundelsheim and a parish of the New Apostolic Church.\n\nDemographics\nPopulation development:\n\nCoat of arms and flag\nThe municipal coat of arms shows a raised silver right hand in red under a lying black deer pole. The coat of arms was introduced after the transition to Württemberg and probably shows a hand raised to oath of subjects. The deer pole stands for belonging to Württemberg.\nThe municipal flag is white and red and was awarded on August 4, 1980.\n\nCulture and sights\nBuildings\nNikolauskirche\nNikolauskirche was a chapel until 1602 and was expanded as a church at that time. In 1836 the tower was demolished and built with sandstone in the neoclassical style. A preciousness inside is the Weimer organ from 1784.\n\nKilianskirche\nAs early as 1247, Saint Kilian's church was mentioned in a papal document and belonged to the Oberstenfeld women's choir monastery. Badly damaged by an army from the free imperial cities of Heilbronn and Hall in 1440 and rebuilt in today's larger form, it houses worth seeing late Gothic frescoes from the years 1460 to 1470.\n\nGrossbottwarer Tor\nAs a sign of the city gate granted in 1422, Mundelsheim was fortified by gates, walls and ditches. The only preserved gate is the Grossbottwarer Tor. It was part of the fortifications and at the same time the official residence of the \"gatekeeper\".\n\nHölderlin pharmacy\nThe house was built in 1747 by pastor Magister Johann Leonhard Hölderlin (uncle of the poet Friedrich Hölderlin). The two-storey plastered building has a hipped mansard roof in the Baroque style. A pharmacy has been operating here since 1832, which gave the building its name.\n\nMunicipal bakehouse\nThe older of the two remaining Municipal bakehouse was built in 1838 due to a ducal order for fire prevention. It is still used regularly as a bakehouse today.\n\nHistorical guided tour\nThe historical guided tour with 24 objects in the centre and other attractions in the outdoor area provides an insight into the history of the place. The tour begins on the market square in front of the community centre. There is an information board on which all the objects are listed. On the buildings and monuments are signs with brief explanations.\n\nMuseum in the tithe barn\nThe history society Geschichtsverein Mundelsheim has set up in the former tithe barn of the monastery Oberstenfeld a wine-growing exhibition. On display boards and display cases the visitors are explained the historical background. As additional stations, a cooper workshop and a wagon-maker workshop are set up.\n\nEconomy and Infrastructure\nThe economy of Mundelsheim, like that of the whole region, is characterized by wine and fruit growing. A very well-known wine location is the Mundelsheimer \"Käsberg\". Like the other locations \"Mühlbächer\" and \"Rozenberg\", it belongs to the large Schalkstein location in the Württemberg Lowlands (Württembergisch Unterland) in the wine-growing region of Württemberg.\n\nTraffic\nMundelsheim is connected to the rail traffic via bus connections to Besigheim and Freiberg. Besigheim has a train station on the Franconia Railway (Stuttgart – Würzburg).

    "title": "Cécile Corbel",
    "text": "Cécile Corbel (born 28 March 1980, in Pont-Croix, Finistère, France) is a French and Breton singer, harpist, and composer. She has released five albums of original music and worked for Studio Ghibli as a composer for its 2010 film Arrietty. Corbel sings in several languages including French, Italian, Breton, and English and has done songs in Spanish, German, Japanese, Irish, and Turkish.\n\nEarly life and education\nCécile Corbel was born in Pont-Croix on 28 March 1980. As a child, she traveled all throughout Brittany with her parents, who had a traveling marionette show. She first learned to play guitar, and discovered the Celtic harp as a teenager during a concert by Greek harpist Elisa Vellia, who later became her teacher. At age 18, after obtaining a baccalauréat scientifique, she moved to Paris to study. She then entered the École du Louvre and earned a MAS in archaeology. She first performed in pubs and the streets of Paris, and gave her first official concert at the pub, Ti Jos, in 2002.\n\nCareer\nProfessional debut\nIn 2005, she released an EP with six tracks, Harpe celtique et chants du monde. After she signed with the record label Keltia Musique, her first studio album was released in 2006. SongBook 1 contained Breton, Welsh, and Irish songs. After this release, she began to go on tour. In 2006, she went to Australia, where she performed at a French festival organized by the Alliance française of Adelaide. She opened Laurent Voulzy's concert at Olympia Hall in Paris, and also shared the stage with Altan, Lúnasa, Alan Stivell, Carlos Núñez Muñoz, Dan Ar Braz, Hélène Flaherty, Ousmane Touré, and Ariana Savall. She performed in many countries including Germany, Switzerland, Italy, England, Estonia, the Czech Republic, Poland, the Netherlands, the United States, Paraguay, and Burma. In 2008, SongBook vol. 2 was released, with the first 10 of the 12 songs composed by Corbel.\nIn 2009, she played the role of Anne of Brittany in the rock opera, Anne de Bretagne. Songwriter Alan Simon chose Cécile Corbel after having difficulty finding someone for the role. Also participating in the project were other musicians such as Tri Yann and Fairport Convention. The show was staged at the end of June 2009 at the Château des ducs de Bretagne in Nantes, and was preceded by an album in which over 200 musicians participated.\n\nWork with Studio Ghibli\nAfter promotion ended for SongBook vol. 2, Corbel still had some promo albums left, so she sent them to people she admired. She sent one to Studio Ghibli because she had been a fan of their films for years. At the time, Arrietty was in pre-production and producer Toshio Suzuki wanted a Celtic-inspired film score. Less than ten days later, she received an email from Studio Ghibli about her CD. The envelope, because it was handwritten, had caught the eye of Suzuki, and he had listened to the CD. He was captivated by Corbel's voice and the sound of the harp, and played the CD for the film's director and Yamaha Music. As a result, Corbel was assigned to write the title song of the film. She was later asked to write more songs. By 2009, she was asked to compose the whole score. This was the first time a non-Japanese composer had worked with the studio.\nThe score combines the musical styles of Celtic folk music, medieval Turkish songs, Baroque madrigals, and Irish marches. It was recorded in France with a small orchestra including acoustic guitar, bass, a string quartet, bagpipes, Irish flutes, bodhrán, percussion instruments, and accordion. The soundtrack album won \"Best Original Soundtrack Album\" at the 2011 Japan Gold Disc Awards. It also became a RIAJ-certified gold record in Japan, where more than 200,000 copies were sold.\n\n2011 to present\nIn June 2011, the third studio album, SongBook vol. 3 – Renaissance was released.\nIn 2012, Corbel along with her long-time collaborator, Simon Caby were invited to Malaysia to perform at the 11th edition of the French Art and Film Festival 2012 (FAFF 2012) organized by the Alliance Française Kuala Lumpur and the Embassy of France in Malaysia. She performed at HELP University, Kuala Lumpur on 8 June and at the Golden Sands Resort, Penang on 9 June as part of the 50th anniversary of the Alliance Française Penang.\n\nIn early 2013, Corbel took part in La Nuit de la Bretagne, performing along with Dan Ar Braz at the Zeniths of Nantes, Lille, and Caen. The fourth studio album, SongBook vol. 4 – Roses, was released on 24 June 2013. This album had influences from Mediterranean, medieval, and world music, including Japanese and Celtic music. It contains songs in French, English, Breton, and even Judaeo-Spanish (\"Hija Mia\"). Most of the twelve tracks are self-composed, and the album incorporates Breton and Irish traditional themes. It also includes a cover of \"The Riddle\", a song by English singer Nik Kershaw.\nIn 2013, Corbel wrote songs and co-composed (with Fabien Cali) the film score for the wildlife documentary, Land of the Bears. The soundtrack album was released 26 February 2014 by Polydor Records. Corbel sings five songs on the album. She also sings and plays harp on \"Les Nuits Urbaines\", the sixth track on Stanislas' album Ma Solitude, released on 28 April 2014.\nOn 26 June 2014, Corbel released a single, \"Entendez-Vous\", from her upcoming album. Her fifth studio album, La Fiancée, was released on 6 October 2014. All twelve songs on the album were written by Corbel, with music co-composed by Simon Caby. The album's musical style is a mixture of classical and pop music. She released her sixth studio album, Vagabonde, on 4 October 2016.\nHer seventh studio album, Enfant du vent, was released on 29 March 2019. Inspired by her son, the album centers around childhood but is aimed at all ages. The track list include two cover songs from Ghibli films—\"Tonari no Totoro\" from My Neighbor Totoro and \"Sayonara no Natsu\" (duet with Misaki Iwasa) from From Up on Poppy Hill.\nSongBook vol. 5 was released on 30 September 2021. Corbel's ninth studio album, La Fille du Verseau, was released on 7 July 2023. All songs on the album were composed by Laurent Tixier and performed by Corbel. Her tenth studio album, Graal, was released on 13 September 2024 and was inspired by Arthurian legend.\n\nPersonal life\nHer lifelong partner is songwriter Simon Caby, who is also her co-composer.\n\nCollaborations\nList of musicians that Corbel performs with at concerts:\n\nCécile Corbel – harp and voice\nCyril Maurin – guitars\nPascal Boucaud – bass and backing vocals\nJulien Grattard – cello\nChristophe Piot – percussion\n\nDiscography\nSongBook 1 (2006)\nSongBook vol. 2 (2008)\nSongBook vol. 3 – Renaissance (2011)\nSongBook vol. 4 – Roses (2013)\nLa Fiancée (2014)\nVagabonde (2016)\nEnfant du Vent (2019)\nSongBook vol. 5 – Notes (2021)\nLa Fille du Verseau (2023)\nGraal (2024)\n\nAccolades\nJapan Gold Disc Awards\nTokyo Anime Awards\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website (in French)",

    "title": "Ukrainian People's Republic",
    "text": "The Ukrainian People's Republic (UPR) was a short-lived state in Eastern Europe. Prior to its proclamation, the Central Council of Ukraine was elected in March 1917 as a result of the February Revolution, and in June, it declared Ukrainian autonomy within Russia. Its autonomy was later recognized by the Russian Provisional Government. Following the October Revolution, the Central Council of Ukraine denounced the Bolshevik seizure of power and proclaimed the Ukrainian People's Republic with a territory including the area of approximately eight Russian imperial governorates (Kiev, Volhynia, Kharkov, Kherson, Yekaterinoslav, Poltava, Chernigov and Podolia). It formally declared its independence from Russia on 22 January 1918.\nDuring its short existence, the republic went through several political transformations – from the socialist-leaning republic headed by the Central Council of Ukraine with its general secretariat, to the socialist republic led by the Directorate and by Symon Petliura. Between April and December 1918, the socialist authority of the Ukrainian People's Republic was suspended, having been overthrown by the pro-German Ukrainian State of Pavlo Skoropadskyi, who was elected as the Hetman of Ukraine by a congress of peasants. After the collapse of the Ukrainian State, the Ukrainian People's Republic declared its unification with the West Ukrainian People's Republic in January 1919. After the Polish–Ukrainian War, it signed an alliance with the Second Polish Republic. On 10 November 1920, the state lost the remainder of its territory to the Bolsheviks. The Peace of Riga on 18 March 1921 between Poland, Soviet Russia (acting also on behalf of Soviet Belarus), and Soviet Ukraine sealed the fate of the Ukrainian People's Republic.\nAfter the October Revolution, many governments formed in the territory of Ukraine, most notably the Ukrainian People's Republic of Soviets based in Kharkov, and its Soviet successors. This force, along with the Ukrainian People's Republic, the White movement, Poland, Green armies, and anarchists, fought constantly with each other, which resulted in many casualties among Ukrainians fighting in the Ukrainian War of Independence as part of the wider Russian Civil War of 1917–1923. Soviet Russia would extend its control over what would ultimately become the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, which became a founding member of the Soviet Union in 1922.\n\nHistory\nRevolutionary wave\nOn 10 June 1917, the Central Council of Ukraine declared its autonomy as part of the Russian Republic by its First Universal at the All-Ukrainian Military Congress. The highest governing body of the Ukrainian People's Republic became the General Secretariat headed by Volodymyr Vynnychenko. The Prime Minister of Russia Alexander Kerensky recognized the Secretariat, appointing it as the representative governing body of the Russian Provisional Government and limiting its powers to five governorates: Volyn, Kiev Governorate, Podolia, Chernigov, and Poltava. At first Vynnychenko protested and left his post as Secretariat leader, but eventually returned to reassemble the Secretariat after the Tsentralna Rada accepted the Kerensky Instruktsiya and issued the Second Universal.\nAfter the October Revolution the Kievan faction of the Bolshevik Party instigated the uprising in Kiev on 8 November 1917 in order to establish Soviet power in the city. Kiev Military District forces attempted to stop it, but after the Tsentralna Rada threw its support behind the Bolsheviks, the Russian forces were eliminated from Kiev. After expelling the government forces, the Rada announced a wider autonomy for the Ukrainian Republic, still maintaining ties to Russia, on 22 November 1917. The territory of the republic was proclaimed by the Third Universal 20 November 1917 (7 November by Old Style) of the Tsentralna Rada encompassing the governorates: Volyn, Kiev, Podolie, Chernigov, Poltava, Kharkov, Yekaterinoslav, Kherson, Taurida (not including Crimea). It also stated that the people of the governorates: Voronezh, Kholm, and Kursk were welcome to join the republic through a referendum. Further the Tsentralna Rada in its Universal stated that because there was no Government in the Russian Republic after the October Revolution it proclaimed itself the Supreme governing body of the territory of Ukraine until order in the Russian republic could be restored. The Central Council of Ukraine called all revolutionary activities such as the October Revolution a civil war and expressed its hopes for the resolution of the chaos.\nAfter a brief truce, the Bolsheviks realized that the Rada had no intention of supporting the Bolshevik Revolution. They re-organized into an All-Ukrainian Council of Soviets in December 1917 in an attempt to seize power. When that failed due to the Bolsheviks' relative lack of popularity in Kiev, they moved to Kharkov. The Bolsheviks of Ukraine declared the government of the Ukrainian People's Republic outlawed and proclaimed the Ukrainian People's Republic of Soviets with capital in Kiev, claiming that the government of the People's Secretaries of Ukraine was the only government in the country. The Bolshevik Red Army entered Ukraine from the Russian SFSR in support of the local Soviet government. As the relationships between members within the Tsentralna Rada soured, a series of regional Soviet republics on the territory of Ukraine proclaimed their independence and allegiance to the Petrograd sovnarkom (Odesa Soviet Republic (southern Ukraine), Donetsk-Krivoi Rog Soviet Republic (eastern Ukraine)). The Donetsk-Kryvoi Rog Republic was created by a direct decree of Lenin as part of the Russian SFSR with its capital in Kharkov. That decree was successfully implemented by Fyodor Sergeyev who became the chairman of the local government as well as joining the Soviet government of Ukraine, simultaneously. Unlike Fyodor Sergeyev's Republic, the Odesa Republic was not recognized by any other Bolshevik governments and on its own initiative had entered a military conflict with Romania for control over the Moldavian Democratic Republic, whose territory it was contesting.\n\nTimeline\nThe following information is based on the exposition of the Museum of Soviet occupation in Kiev (Memorial in Kiev).\n\nSpring 1917\n8–12 March – February Revolution in the Russian Empire, victory of the democratic forces\n17 March – establishment of the Ukrainian Central Council\n4 April – recreation of Prosvita, establishment of the Ukrainian Cooperative Committee, and the Temporary Military Council, liberation of the people of Galicia, particularly Andrey Sheptytsky\n9 April – Mykhailo Hrushevsky returns from exile to head the Ukrainian Central Council\n10 April – the Ukrainian Central Council supported the convocation of the Ukrainian National Congress\n11 April – establishment of the Ukrainian Military Society of Hetman Polubotok headed by Mykola Mikhnovsky, organization of the 1st Ukrainian Volunteer Regiment of Bohdan Khmelnytsky\n13 April – a big demonstration took place in Kiev with over 100,000 people, establishment of the Ukrainian National Council in Petrograd\n2–4 May – the Ukrainian National Congress took place in Kiev, involving about 900 delegates, the Congress confirmed the composition of the Ukrainian Central Council of 150 members headed by Mykhailo Hrushevsky\n17 May – the commander of the Southwestern Front General Brusilov permitted the organization of the Bohdan Khmelnytsky Regiment which drafted 3,574 volunteers\n18 – 1 May Ukrainian Military Congress took place in Kiev attended by over 700 delegates.

The All-Ukrainian Agrarian Congress elects Pavlo Skoropadsky the Hetman of Ukraine\n\nIndependence\nDue to the aggression from Soviet Russia, on 22 January 1918, the Tsentralna Rada issued its Fourth Universal (dated 22 January 1918), breaking ties with Bolshevik Russia and proclaiming a sovereign Ukrainian state. Less than a month later, on 9 February 1918, the Red Army seized Kiev.\nBesieged by the Bolsheviks and having lost much territory, the Rada was forced to seek foreign aid, and signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk on 9 February 1918 to obtain military help from the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires. Germany helped the Ukrainian Army force the Bolsheviks out of Ukraine. On 20 February 1918 the council of the Kuban People's Republic accepted the resolution for a federal union of Kuban with Ukraine as Bolshevik forces pushed towards Yekaterinodar. It was agreed to forward the resolution for ratification to the Ukrainian government.\nAfter the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Ukraine became a virtual protectorate of the German Empire which at that time seemed more favorable than being overrun by the Soviet forces that were spreading havoc in the country. Germany was anxious about losing the war and was trying to speed up the process of food extraction from Ukraine, so it decided to install its own administration in the person of Generalfeldmarschall von Eichhorn who replaced the Colonel General Alexander von Linsingen. On 6 April the commander of the Army group Kijew issued an order in which he explained his intentions to execute the conditions of the treaty. That, of course, conflicted with the laws of the Ukrainian government, which annulled his order. By April 1918 the German-Austrian Operation Faustschlag offensive had completely removed the Bolsheviks from Ukraine. The German/Austro-Hungarian victories in Ukraine were due to the apathy of the locals and the inferior fighting skills of Bolsheviks troops compared to their Austro-Hungarian and German counterparts.\nThe Germans arrested and disbanded the Tsentralna Rada on 29 April 1918 to stop the social reforms that were taking place and restarted the process of food supply transfer to Germany and Austria-Hungary. The German authorities also arrested the Ukrainian Prime Minister, Vsevolod Holubovych, on terrorist charges, and thus disbanded the Council of People's Ministers. Prior to this, the Rada had approved the Constitution of the Ukrainian People's Republic. Concurrently with all these events and a few days prior to the change of powers in the country on 24 April 1918 the government of Belarus confirmed the Belarusian Chamber of Commerce in Kiev headed by Mitrofan Dovnar-Zapolsky on the initiative of the Belarusian secretary of finance Pyotr Krechevsky.\n\nHetmanate\nAfter the coup, the Rada was replaced by the conservative government of Hetman Pavlo Skoropadsky, the Hetmanate, and the Ukrainian People's Republic by a \"Ukrainian State\" (Ukrainska derzhava). Skoropadsky, a former officer of the Russian Empire, established a regime favoring large landowners and concentrating power at the top. The government had little support from Ukrainian activists, but unlike the socialist Rada, it was able to establish an effective administrative organization, established diplomatic ties with many countries, and concluded a peace treaty with Soviet Russia. In a few months, the Hetmanate also printed millions of Ukrainian language textbooks, established many Ukrainian schools, two universities, and the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences.\nThe Hetmanate government also supported the confiscation of previously nationalized peasant lands by wealthy estate owners, often with the help of German troops. This led to unrest, the rise of a peasant partisan (guerrilla) movement, and a series of large-scale popular armed revolts. Negotiations were held to garner support from previous Rada members Petliura and Vynnychenko, but these activists worked to overthrow Skoropadsky. On 30 July, a Russian Left Socialist-Revolutionary, Boris Mikhailovich Donskoy, with help from the local USRP succeeded in assassinating von Eichhorn, blowing him up in downtown Kiev at a broadlight.\nDue to the impending loss of World War I by Germany and Austria-Hungary, Skoropadsky's sponsors, the Hetman formed a new cabinet of Russian Monarchists and committed to federation with a possible future non-Bolshevik Russia. In response, the Ukrainian socialists announced a new revolutionary government, the Directorate, on 14 November 1918.\n\nTimeline\nSpring 1918\n29 April – All-Ukrainian Agrarian Congress elects Pavlo Skoropadsky as the Hetman of Ukraine\n30 April – Mykola Vasylenko was appointed the Chairman of Council of Ministers and tasked with the formation of government\n7 May – the Council of Ministers confirmed its intentions to add Crimea to the Ukrainian State\n15 May – Signing of a treaty between governments of Ukraine from one side and Germany and Austria-Hungary from another to provide a loan in amount of 400 million karbovanets for acquiring the Ukrainian food\n18 May – the Council of Ministers adopted the law about a creation of the State Guard\n23 May – started peace negotiations between representatives of Ukraine and Russia\n28 May – to Kiev arrived the plenipotentiary delegation of the Regional Council of Kuban headed by Mykola Ryabovol with proposition of unification of Kuban with Ukraine\n30 May – the Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Doroshenko petitioned with a special letter to the Ambassador of Germany in Ukraine, baron Alfons Mumm von Schwarzenstein, to include Crimea to Ukraine\n\nSummer 1918\n12 June – the Congress of Landowners and Agrarians of Tavria Governorate that took place in Simferopol supported the proposition to include Tavria to Ukraine\n20 June – the All-Ukrainian Church Council took place in Kiev\n1 July – adopted the decision about a creation of the Ukrainian university in Kamianets-Podilsky\n2 July – adoption of the law about citizenship of the Ukrainian State\n8 July – creation of the State Senate of the Ukrainian State as the supreme judicial institution\n9 July – creation of the commission in development of project of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences\n10 July – Kiev Orthodox clergy lifted the anathema on Hetman Mazepa\n24 July – Ukraine and Germany ratified the Brest Peace Treaty, adoption of laws about the general military obligation, criminal responsibility for exceeding the maximum established prices and speculation, appointments to government service\n27 July – due to the anti-Ukrainian policies of the Crimean government of Sulkevich the Ukrainian State established an economical blockade of the peninsula\n1 August – adoption of laws about supreme government and political position of military servicemen\n2 August – adoption of the law about the creation of fund of the National Library of Ukrainian State\n6 August – the All-Ukrainian Church Council called for the autocephaly of the Ukrainian Church\n10 August – confirmed the statute of the Ukrainian State Bank and its base and reserve capitals\n17 August – adopted the law about a restriction on import of the Russian monetary units\n22 August – in Vienna Turkey and Ukraine exchanged documents that ratified the Brest Peace Treaty\n10 September – signing of an economic agreement between Ukraine, Germany, Austria-Hungary for the 1918–1919 fiscal years\n18 September – temporary stop of custom war with Crimea on the petition of the Sulkevich government\n\nAutumn 1918\n5 October – in Kiev started negotiations between Ukraine and Crimea about the conditions of Crimea inclusion to Ukraine\n6 October – Kiev State Ukrainian University is opened\n16 October – Hetman of Ukraine issued declaration on the revival of cossackdom\n17 October – adopted a declaration about organization of volunteer militia on upholding the order of law\n21 October – Hetman of Ukraine met with the extraordinary mission of the Kuban regional government headed by Colonel V.

Their insurgent army encircled Kiev on 21 November. After a three-week-long stalemate Skoropadsky abdicated in favor of the Council of Ministers who surrendered to the Revolutionary forces. On 19 December 1918, the Directorate took control of Kiev.\nThe Bolsheviks invaded Ukraine from Kursk in late December 1918 where the new Ukrainian Soviet government was reestablished earlier in November of the same year. On 16 January 1919 Ukraine officially declared a war on Russia while the Russian Soviet government continued to deny all claims of invasion. On 22 January 1919, the Directorate was officially united with the West Ukrainian People's Republic, although the latter entity de facto maintained its own army and government. On 5 February, the Bolsheviks captured Kiev.\nThroughout 1919, Ukraine experienced chaos as the armies of the Ukrainian Republic, the Bolsheviks, the Whites, the foreign powers of the Entente, and Poland, as well as anarchist forces such as that of Nestor Makhno tried to prevail. The subsequent Kiev offensive, staged by the Polish army and allied Ukrainian forces, was unable to change the situation. On 10 November 1920, the Directorate lost the remainder of its territory to the Bolsheviks in Volhynia as it crossed into Poland to accept internment. In March 1921, the Peace of Riga sealed a shared control of the territory by Poland, the Russian SFSR, and the Ukrainian SSR.\nAs the result, the lands of Galicia (Halychyna) as well as a large part of the Volhynian territory were incorporated into Poland, while the areas to the east and south became part of Soviet Ukraine.\nAfter its military and political defeat, the Directorate continued to maintain control over some of its military forces. Preempting a planned invasion by its rival Archduke Wilhelm of Austria, in October 1921 the Ukrainian National Republic's government-in-exile launched a series of guerrilla raids into central Ukraine that reached as far east as Kiev Oblast. On 4 November, the Directorate's guerrillas captured Korosten and seized much military supplies. But on 17 November 1921, this force was surrounded by Bolshevik cavalry and destroyed.\n\nTimeline\nWinter 1918–19\n14 December – the Directorate of Ukraine received the state powers in Ukraine after the Hetman of Ukraine emigrated to Germany\n16 December – the Directorate renewed the law about National-Individual Autonomy\n19 December – the grand entry of Directorate to the capital of Ukraine.

Some of them were in opposition to the Petlyura's government (such as the Oskilko's Affair), some were against the establishment of the Soviet regime, some took place to eliminate the Entente forces. According to Cheka documentation, in Ukraine took place 268 uprisings from 1917 through 1932, where in over 100 raions the mutinied peasants were killing chekists, communists, and prodotryads that were requisitioning food by force which more resembled expropriation.\n\nMakhnovshchina (Nestor Makhno)\nOtaman Grigoriev\nOtaman Oskilko Affair (Volodymyr Oskilko)\nOtaman Zelenyi Uprising\nKholodnyi Yar (Cold Ravine)\nOtaman Kamenyuka\nFree Cossacks (Semen Hryzlo)\nZazymia Uprising (Troyeshchyna) – Otaman Romashka and Otaman Anhel against Kiev and Chernihiv Cheka and Bashkir Cavalry Brigade\nAnti-Red Army ambush near Uman in 1920\n\nExile\nThe government of Ukrainian People's Republic operated in Warsaw, Paris, Weimar, Kissingen, Munich, and Philadelphia.\nAfter the beginning of the World War II Taras Bulba-Borovets, with the support of the President of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile Andrii Livytskyi, crossed the German-Soviet border and started organizing UPA military units subordinate to the UPR Government.\nThe 10th Emergency Session of the Ukrainian National Council recognized the state of Ukraine as the successor of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile and agreed to transfer the powers and attributes of state power to the newly elected President of Ukraine in 1991.\n\nInternational recognition\nThe Ukrainian People's Republic was recognized de jure in February 1918 by the Central Powers of World War I (Austria-Hungary, Germany, the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria) and by Bolshevik Russia, the Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania), Georgia, Azerbaijan, Romania, Czechoslovakia, the Holy See, the Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus, Armenia, and Kuban (the latter of which sought unification with it). De facto recognition was granted by Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, and Persia. Partial de facto recognition was received from the Belarusian Democratic Republic (see Belarus–Ukraine relations).\nLater in 1918 Russia chose to withdraw its recognition of independent Ukraine, representing the protocols of the Versailles Treaty as justification for its action. In 1920 Symon Petliura and Józef Piłsudski signed the Warsaw Treaty in which both countries established their borders along the Zbruch River. The states that previously recognized the Ukrainian People's Republic ceased any relationships with its Government-in-exile after they recognized the Soviet Government in Kiev.\n\nImportant diplomatic missions and results\nTreaty of Brest-Litovsk, 9 February 1918 (Central Powers: ratification of Germany and Turkey)\nPreliminary peace treaty with the Soviet Russia, 12 June 1918 (renouncement of Brest-Litovsk treaty on 13 November 1918)\nPeace treaty with Don Republic, 8 August 1918\nUnification Act, 20 January 1919 (unification of two semi-recognized entities), Hutsul Republic (Eastern Zakarpattia) announced their will to join as well\nLoss of Kiev to Soviets on 2 February 1919 and political crisis within the national government of Ukraine\nResignation of Serhiy Ostapenko and his government due to failure on series of negotiations with representatives of Entente\nParticipation at the Paris Peace Conference, 1919\nThe Eastern Galician mandate of the Jules Cambon Commission was approved by the Entente leaders to hand it over the Poland, 21 November 1919\nTreaty of Warsaw (1920) (Poland)\n\nDemographics\nAccording to the latest census that was taken 1897, the republic was accounted for over 20 million population in seven former Russian guberniyas, plus three uyezds of the Taurida Governorate that were located on the mainland.\n\nNational composition (thousands)\nUkrainians – 14,931.5 (73%)\nRussians – 2,146.1 (11%)\nJewish – 1,871.8 (9%)\nGermans – 451.3 (2%)\nPoles – 375.9 (2%)\nBelarusians – 208.5 (1%)\nRomanians – 185.7 (1%)\nOther – 1%\n\nAdministrative division\nOn 4 March 1918 the Ukrainian government accepted the law about the administrative-territorial division of Ukraine. The law stated that Ukraine is divided into 32 zemlia (land) which are administered by their respective zemstvo. This law was not fully implemented as on 29 April 1918 there was the anti-socialist coup in Kiev, after which Hetman Pavlo Skoropadsky reverted the reform back to the guberniya-type administration.\n\nArmed forces\nThe headquarters of the republic's armed forces was called the General Bulawa and was considered to be located in Kiev. Of course, due to constant intervention from the Petrograd sovnarkom and the German Empire the physical location of it was changing (Kamyanets-Podilsky, Bila Tserkva, others).\n\nMain military formations (UPR)\nSich Riflemen\nUkrainian Sich Riflemen were a similar unit, however, that unit wasn't part of Ukrainian military\nFree Cossacks\nThe following three Zaporizhian infantry regiments and the 3 Haidamaka Regiment of the biggest Ukrainian military formation, the Zaporizhian Corps, later were reorganized into the 1 Zaporizhian Division.\n\nZaporizhian Corps\nUkrainian Steppe Division (Anti-Bolshevik revolutionary-military unit)\nUkrainian Marines\n1 Riflemen-Cavalry Division (Gray-Coats)\nBlue-Coats\nSloboda Ukraine Haidamaka Kosh\n3 Iron Riflemen Division\nUkrainian People's Republic Air Fleet\nNavy of the Ukrainian People's Republic\n\nMain military formations (WUPR)\nUkrainian Galician Army, was a military formation of the West Ukrainian People's Republic\n\nMoney and banking\nIn December 1918 a temporary law about the issue of state banknotes by the UPR was adopted. According to this law: \"Bank-notes must be issued in karbovanets\" (Ukrainian: Карбованець). Each karbovanets contains 17.424 parts of pure gold and is divided into two hrivnas (Ukrainian: Гривня) or 200 shahs (Ukrainian: Шаг).\nThere were numerous banks in the republic among the most popular ones were the Ukrainabank and the Soyuzbank that were created by Khrystofor Baranovsky, the leader of a cooperative movement.\n\nMaps\nThe area claimed by the Ukrainian People's Republic in 1919 (red and pink), compared with Ukraine after it regained independence in 1991 (red and green for the territories not claimed in 1919).\n\nSee also\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\nFurther reading\nExternal links\n Media related to Ukrainian People's Republic at Wikimedia Commons\nPeople's war 1917–1932 by Kiev city organization \"Memorial\"\nUNIVERSAL of the Ukrainian Central Rada addressed to the Ukrainian people living in and outside of Ukraine..

    "text": "Mohammad Reza Naqdi (also spelled \"Naghdi\"; Persian: محمدرضا نقدی) is an Iranian military officer who is a senior officer in the IRGC.\n\nBackground\nAccording to the biography published by the semi-official Fars News Agency, Naqdi was born in March 1961 in a middle-class religious family in Shapour neighbourhood of Tehran. Aging 16, he enrolled in University of Guilan in 1977 and co-founded its Anjoman-e Eslami. He helped founding Jihad of Construction in June 1979, before joining the Revolutionary Guards Intelligence Unit.\nThe Majalla claims that Naqdi is an Iraqi national of Iranian origin and the son of a Shiite cleric named Ali Akbar Thamahniy Shams, who was expelled from Iraq in 1980 among convoys of Moaveds and was placed in the city of Naqadeh with his family. He was allegedly affiliated with the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.\n\nCareer\nEarlier in his career Naqdi served as the Iranian Police Force's Counter-Intelligence Chief and is also reported to have been involved in \"crackdowns\" during the 1997-2005 administration of Khatami including the 1999 student protests. Amnesty International reported that in March 1999 Iranian authorities announced that General Naqdi, chief of police intelligence at the time, to be tried in May by a military court along with 10 of his subordinates. \"The charges against them are believed to include 'unlawful arrest' and 'using torture to elicit confessions'.\" He was found not guilty.\nNaqdi was appointed by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei as commander of the Basij in October 2009, replacing Hossein Taeb. He has been described as possessing \"conservative credentials\" and his appointment was said (by Mohsen Sazegara) to have \"shattered the hopes and plans of those who thought they could ease\" the unrest and protest following the reelection of President Ahmadinejad.\n\n2009 protests\nOn 14 February 2011 Naqdi was quoted by the semi-official Fars news agency as saying he believed the February protests in Iran had been started by \"western spies\" and that \"western intelligence agencies are searching for a mentally challenged person who can set himself on fire in Tehran to trigger developments like those in Egypt and Tunisia.\" Naqdi was also quoted as saying the basij were \"ready to sacrifice their lives\" to defend the Islamic regime, and likened the opposition to the \"party of Satan.\"\nTwo weeks later on 23 February 2011, the US Treasury Department imposed sanctions on General Naqdi, \"for being responsible for or complicit in serious human rights abuses in Iran\", adding him to the Office of Foreign Assets Control blacklist. The action subjects him \"to visa sanctions\" and \"seeks to block any assets\" he may have under U.S. jurisdiction, and \"bans U.S. citizens from financial transactions with them\".\n\nViews\nIsrael\nIn 2011 Naqdi called on Israeli citizens to leave the region voluntarily. He said, \"We recommend them to pack their furniture and return to their countries,\" adding that if they remained, \"a time will arrive when they will not even have time to pack their suitcases.\"\nDuring a 2015 speech Naqdi threatened Israel and declared that an Israeli attack on Hizbullah forces which led to killing of an Iranian revolutionary guard official in Syria will be responded to by liberating of Palestine.\n\nCOVID-19\nAfter the Supreme leader of Iran ayatollah Ali Khamenei banned the import of British and US vaccines against COVID-19 in January 2021, General Naqdi commented that the ayatollah \"does not recommend the injection of any foreign vaccine\", because the genetic material (mRNA) it contains instructs cells to produce proteins.\n\nReferences\n\n\n== External links ==",

    "title": "Assembly of Delvino",
    "text": "The Pan-Epirotic Assembly of Delvino (Greek: Πανηπειρωτική Διάσκεψη Δέλβινου) was a meeting of the representatives of the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus, in June–July 1914, that ratified the Protocol of Corfu. The latter agreement granted an autonomous status for Northern Epirus, as well as a number of rights for the local Greek populations, inside the borders of the newly established Principality of Albania.\nThe assembly took place in the town of Delvinë (southern Albania) with the participation of deputies from all provinces of Northern Epirus. It lasted from June 23 to July 26, 1914, and led to the ratification of the terms of the Protocol of Corfu, despite objections raised by various sides asking for wider autonomy. The Greek government under Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, also supported the approval of the Protocol, as the only means to secure peace and stability for the region, while on the other hand the representatives of the coastal region of Himara, insisted that only incorporation to Greece would be a viable solution for Northern Epirus.\n\nBackground\nBy the end of the Balkan Wars (1912-1913), Greek armed forces managed to defeat the Ottoman army and control most of the historical region of Epirus. Thus, they reached a line from Himara on the Ionian coast east to Prespa Lake. Pending the final decision of the following peace treaty, the region remained under Greek military control. On 17 December 1913, the Protocol of Florence ceded the northern part of Epirus to the newly established Principality of Albania. This turn of events catalysed an uprising among the local Greek population, who declared the independence of Northern Epirus. The Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus was thus proclaimed in Argyrokastro (Gjirokastër) on 28 February 1914, while a provisional government was formed under Georgios Christakis-Zografos.\nMeanwhile, serious disturbances broke out in a number of places between the Northern Epirote forces and Albanian gendarmerie units and irregulars. An International Commission of Control formed by the Great Powers to secure stability and peace in the region was unable to achieve an agreement between the two sides.\n\nProtocol of Corfu\nBy May 17, 1914, at a meeting held nearby in Corfu, Greece, representatives from both sides signed an agreement that would be known as Protocol of Corfu. According to this the districts of Korytsa and Argyrokastro, which form Northern Epirus, were recognized as an autonomous self-governing region under the sovereignty of the newly established Prince William of Albania. Moreover, the agreement granted the local Greeks wider religious, educational, cultural and political autonomy, inside the borders of the Albanian state. Subsequently, on June 1 the Great Powers approved the terms of the Protocol, while on June 23 they were officially approved by the Albanian Government.\n\nFirst meeting\nThe Northern Epirote representatives in the following Pan-Epirotic Assembly of Delvino had to take the final decision on whether to accept the Protocol. The provisional government had to assemble the representatives from all parts of Northern Epirus in order to ratify the terms of the Protocol. Thus, Delvino, which was one of the first towns in Northern Epirus to declare autonomy against annexation to Albania, was proclaimed the seat of the following assembly. The representatives, listed by province, were as follows:\n\nHimara: Spyros Spyromilios, Dimitrios Lekkas, Nikolaos Milios\nAgioi Saranta: Ioannis Kouremenos\nDelvino: Evangelos Giatis, Evangelos Trichas, Panagiotis Lezos\nArgyrokastro: Kyriakos Kyritsis, Georgios Tselios, Charalambos Katsis\nPremeti: Zacharias Alexiou, Charalambos Donatos, Georgios Syngelos\nTepeleni: Petros Charitos, Vasileios Dilios\nPogoni: Georgios Ginopoulos, Papaspyros, Dimitriadis\nLeskoviki: Vasileios Sotiriadis, Ilias Oikonomou Rousis\nErseka: Petros Prontinis, Dimitrios Papanastasiou\nKorytsa (Korcë): Iosif Adamidis, Konstantinos Skenderis, metropolitan bishop of Korytsa, Germanos, Konstantinos Polenas\nAdditional five delegates, representing the wider region.\n\nThe provisional government was represented by its president, Georgios-Christakis Zografos, as well as by Dimitrios Doulis, Alexandros Karapanos, Georgios Boussios, and the local metropolitan bishops Vasileios and Spyridon. Discussions started at June 23. Zografos, stated in his inaugural speech:\n\nI should add that the danger for the fortunes of our nation has not dissipated entirely. There is therefore a great need for circumspection and vigilance to the decisions which are to be taken by this assembly on whether to ratify or not the Corfu agreement\nAdditionally, Zografos proposed that the working sessions be put off until June 26, so the representatives would have the sufficient time to study the text of the Protocol.\n\nPolitical and military developments\nMeanwhile, political turmoil broke out in Albania, where the official government was unable to control the situation. The guerrilla forces of Essad Pasha Toptani managed to capture Elbasan in central Albania, while various irregular bands in this sector pillaged the countryside and moved against Korcë, which was part of the Northern Epirus region, but still under the control of the Albanian gendarmerie.\nZografos, worried by these developments, and contrary to the warnings of the Greek Prime Minister, Eleftherios Venizelos, ordered the Northern Epirote forces to enter the city immediately, which happened in July. Finally, Essad Pasha requested negotiations with the Northern Epirotes since he was already involved with the conflict against Prince Wied. At the same time, in the sector of Këlcyrë (Kleisoura) the autonomist forces successfully engaged Albanian units.\n\nDisagreements over the Protocol and ratification\nThe military successes of the Northern Epirote forces triggered much enthusiasm among some of their leaders. The latter claimed that the northern border of Northern Epirus should be drawn further north, including additional areas which, according to them, where once also part of historical Epirus. Additionally, some Epitore representatives claimed that they should negotiate for wider autonomy, while the Greek populations of Vlorë and Berat, which lay north of the claimed autonomist boundary, should also enjoy the same religious and educational rights.\nThe Greek government, without being involved until then in the situation, was aware of the negotiations and the possibility of a final agreement. Greek Prime Minister Venizelos urged Zografos to approve the protocol’s terms as soon as possible without asking for even wider autonomy. Venizelos warned Zografos of the risks that would entail in case of non-ratification:\n\nI am surprised to see that you are hesitating over the ratification of the Corfu agreement by the Epirot assembly. We consider this an absolutely necessary act, so that a basis can exist safeguarding that which has already been gained. Otherwise the Greek government cannot content itself with the announcement of the Powers that they have ratified the Corfu agreement, nor can it ask, based on this announcement, anything if the Epirots do not accept this treaty...\nThe Assembly met in session again at June 26, and discussions were long and intense. The strongest objections were raised by the representatives of Himara, and especially by its representative, Spyros Spyromilios. The latter considered that the Northern Epirotes had nothing to gain from this Protocol, despite the hard won struggle. Especially, he claimed that the Protocol’s provisions about Himara, were left to the goodwill of the International Commission of Control. Spyromilios also reminded the delegates that when the Northern Epirote struggle started, in February 1914, all participants had unanimously decided for \"complete autonomy or total destruction\".\nIn general, all the representatives agreed that the Protocol did not fulfil the aspirations of the Northern Epirote struggle. Finally, the delegates ratified the terms of Protocol of Corfu. On the other hand, the representatives of Himara decided to withdraw, protesting in favor of union (Enosis) with Greece.\n\nAftermath\nThe Protocol of Corfu, although having been accepted by both sides and sanctioned by the Great Powers, was unable to be implemented. After the outbreak of World War I on July 28, 1914, the situation in Albania became unstable and political chaos ensued. When the country became split into a number of regional governments, Prince William departed the country in September 1914. On 27 October, after approval of the Great Powers, the Greek army re-entered Northern Epirus and the Provisional Government of Northern Epirus formally ceased to exist, declaring that it had accomplished its objectives. The region was de facto annexed to Greece until the second half of 1916, when Italian troops evicted the Greek army from the area. After the end of World War I it was finally ceded to the Principality of Albania.\n\nReferences\nSources\nBoeckh, Katrin (1996).

    "text": "Brock McGinn (born February 2, 1994) is a Canadian professional ice hockey left winger who is currently an unrestricted free agent. He most recently played for the Anaheim Ducks of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was drafted 47th overall by the Carolina Hurricanes in the 2012 NHL entry draft. He previously played for the Hurricanes and the Pittsburgh Penguins.\n\nPlaying career\nAfter graduating from minor hockey with the Guelph Jr. Storm of the Ontario Minor Hockey Association (OMHA), McGinn was selected by the Guelph Storm of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) in the third round, 46th overall in the OHL Priority Selection Draft. He played with the Storm from 2010–11 through 2013–14. At the beginning of the 2011–12 season, McGinn was named an alternate captain. In his final season with the Storm, McGinn established a career high numbers in his junior career in which he tallied 43 goals and 85 points. The Storm won the 2014 J. Ross Robertson Cup as the OHL champions over the North Bay Battalion, with McGinn scoring the Storm's opening goal in the final. The Storm then proceeded to play in the 2014 Memorial Cup tournament, where McGinn scored five points in five games. However, the Storm lost in the final to the Edmonton Oil Kings.\nMcGinn was selected by the Carolina Hurricanes of the National Hockey League (NHL) in the second round, 47th overall during the 2012 NHL entry draft. On April 3, 2013, the Hurricanes signed McGinn to a three-year, entry-level contract.  With the Storm eliminated from the OHL playoffs, McGinn joined the Hurricanes' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Charlotte Checkers, for the remainder of the 2012–13 AHL season.\nIn his first full professional season in 2014–15, McGinn recorded 15 goals and 27 points in 73 games for the Checkers. During the 2014–15 season, McGinn was suspended by the AHL for one game for charging on March 3, 2015. After scoring two goals in two games to start the 2015–16 season with the Checkers, McGinn received his first NHL recall and made his debut on October 16, 2015 against the Detroit Red Wings. In his first shift, McGinn scored his first NHL goal to open the scoring after only 55 seconds. It was the fastest debut goal since Alexander Mogilny scored after 20 seconds in 1989. He also contributed with an assist to help the Hurricanes defeat the Red Wings 5–3.  He finished the season with four points in 21 games.\nMcGinn became a regular for the Hurricanes during the 2016–17 season, skating in 57 games, scoring 16 points. He signed a two-year contract extension with the Hurricanes on June 28, 2017. McGinn had his best season during the 2017–18 season where he scored 16 goals and 30 points in 80 games. McGinn finished the 2018–19 season having played in all 82 games, scoring 10 goals and 26 points. In Game 7 of the 2019 Eastern Conference First Round against the Washington Capitals, McGinn made a save with just over two minutes remaining in regulation, and scored the series-winning goal with 8:55 left in double overtime on an assist by Justin Williams. This was the first Hurricanes playoff win since 2009. On July 20, 2019, the Hurricanes re-signed McGinn to a two-year, $4.2 million contract extension.\nUpon reaching unrestricted free agency after the 2020–21 season, McGinn joined the Pittsburgh Penguins on July 28, 2021 by signing a four-year, $11 million contract. He scored his first goal as a Penguin on October 16, 2021 in a 5–2 win over the Chicago Blackhawks. On March 11, 2022, McGinn suffered an upper body injury in a game versus the Carolina Hurricanes. He returned to the lineup on April 13 after missing fifteen games. In his second season with the Penguins, McGinn struggled on the third line, going 26 games without a point. This was despite scoring two game-winning goals in back-to-back games in November. On February 28, 2023, Pittsburgh placed McGinn on waivers.\nMcGinn cleared waivers and on March 3 the Penguins traded him and a third-round draft pick in the 2024 NHL entry draft to the Anaheim Ducks in exchange for defenceman Dmitry Kulikov. McGinn made his Ducks debut on March 7 in a 5–2 loss to the Seattle Kraken. He scored his first goal as a Duck in his second game, a 3–2 overtime loss to the Vancouver Canucks on March 8. On April 6, 2023 McGinn suffered an upper body injury in a 3–1 loss to the Edmonton Oilers that caused him to miss the rest of the season. McGinn suffered a lower body injury during the Ducks' 2023 training camp that led \nto him being placed on injured reserve at the beginning of the 2023–24 season. He was activated and made his season debut on November 16, 2023 in an 8–2 loss to the Colorado Avalanche.\n\nPersonal life\nMcGinn has two brothers who also play professional hockey, with Brock being the youngest. Jamie (born 1988) was a 2006 second-round pick by the San Jose Sharks who most recently played for the Florida Panthers. Tye (born 1990) was a 2010 fourth-round pick by the Philadelphia Flyers and who most recently played for the Chicago Wolves of the AHL.\nAlong with his father, Bob McGinn, and his two brothers, he is one of the owners of the Roanoke Rail Yard Dawgs of the Southern Professional Hockey League.\n\nCareer statistics\nReferences\nExternal links\nBiographical information and career statistics from NHL.com, or Eliteprospects.com, or Eurohockey.com, or Hockey-Reference.com, or The Internet Hockey Database, or TSN.ca",

    "title": "Scream (1996 film)",
    "text": "Scream is a 1996 American slasher film directed by Wes Craven and written by Kevin Williamson. It stars David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, Matthew Lillard, Rose McGowan, Skeet Ulrich, and Drew Barrymore. Set in the fictional town of Woodsboro, California, the plot follows high school student Sidney Prescott (Campbell) and her friends, who, on the anniversary of her mother's murder, become the targets of a costumed serial killer.\nWilliamson, who was struggling to get his projects off the ground, was inspired by reports of a series of murders by the Gainesville Ripper as he wrote a screenplay that satirized the clichés of the slasher genre popularized in films such as Halloween (1978), Friday the 13th (1980), and Craven's own A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984). Developed under the title Scary Movie, Williamson's script became the subject of an intense bidding war from multiple studios before Miramax Films purchased the rights for its Dimension Films label. Craven, despite turning down the opportunity multiple times, agreed to direct the film after he had read the script as he was determined to re-establish himself after several career setbacks. The involvement of Barrymore and Cox helped secure more support from the studio. Principal photography took place from April to June 1996 in California on a budget of $15 million. Craven trimmed down the violence in the film after being involved in a tense conflict with the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) over the desired R rating.\nReleased on December 20, Scream was not expected to perform well due to concerns over releasing a slasher film in a time normally reserved for holiday entertainment. However, it went on to gross approximately $173 million worldwide through the strength of word of mouth, becoming an unexpected success and one of the highest-grossing films of the year. Contemporary reviews were positive, with praise going to the performances of its cast and its unique meta humor, but criticism was directed at its excessive violence and lack of suspense in favor of that humor. Scream revitalized both Craven's and Barrymore's careers and helped bolster the careers of its young cast.\nIn the years since its release, Scream's reception has continued to be positive. It has been credited with rekindling interest in the horror genre during the 1990s following a decline in the genre's popularity and has been credited for shifting the genre towards younger audiences and casting established actors. The film's opening sequence, in which Barrymore's character is killed by Ghostface, is considered one of the most shocking and subversive in cinematic history. The success of the film launched a multimedia franchise, which comprises the sequels Scream 2 (1997), Scream 3 (2000), Scream 4 (2011), Scream (2022), Scream VI (2023), and Scream 7 (2026), as well as an anthology television series.\n\nPlot\nIn the small town of Woodsboro, California, high school student Casey Becker is home alone when she receives a phone call from an unknown person. They discuss horror films until the caller turns sadistic, threatening her life and revealing that her boyfriend, Steve Orth, is tied up on her patio. The caller demands she answer questions about horror films to save his life, but Casey gives an incorrect answer about Friday the 13th, resulting in Steve's death. Casey attempts to escape, but is stabbed to death by someone wearing a \"Ghostface\" costume, and her disemboweled corpse is found hanging from a tree by her parents.\nThe next morning, the news media descend on the town as a police investigation ensues. Casey's classmate, Sidney Prescott, struggles with the impending first anniversary of the rape and murder of her mother Maureen by Cotton Weary. The trauma has made her unable to consummate her relationship with her boyfriend, Billy Loomis. As her father Neil is traveling for work, Sidney waits at home alone for her best friend, Tatum Riley. She receives a call taunting her about Maureen's death and is attacked by Ghostface, who disappears just before Billy climbs through her window. Sidney immediately grows suspicious when he drops a cell phone, and Billy is arrested by Deputy Sheriff Dewey, Tatum's brother. Outside the police station, Sidney gets into a physical altercation with investigative journalist Gale Weathers. Gale had written a book claiming that Maureen had multiple extramarital affairs, including one with Cotton, who Gale believes was falsely accused of Maureen's homicide. Sidney stays at Tatum's home but receives another taunting call from the killer. The calls are traced to Neil's phone, but the police are unable to locate him.\nFollowing his release, Billy encounters Sidney at school and further upsets her by comparing his absent mother to Maureen's death. After suspending classes in the wake of the murders, Principal Himbry is killed in his office. To celebrate the school's closure, Stu Macher, Tatum's boyfriend, hosts a party at his secluded home. Dewey and Gale keep watch on the party in case the killer strikes again. Tatum is isolated in the garage by Ghostface, who crushes her neck in the garage door. As fellow high schooler Randy Meeks details the rules of surviving a horror film, news arrives of Himbry's murder. Most partygoers leave to see his body, nearly running over Dewey and Gale while inadvertently leading them to Neil's hidden car. Billy arrives at the house to reconcile with Sidney, and they finally have sex. Afterward, they are attacked by Ghostface, and Billy is stabbed. Sidney evades Ghostface, who kills Gale's cameraman Kenny and stabs Dewey when he returns. Gale, attempting to flee in her van, crashes and is knocked unconscious. Sidney seeks refuge inside the house, locking Stu and Randy outside as they accuse each other of being the killer.\nA seemingly wounded Billy emerges and allows Randy inside before shooting him in the shoulder, revealing himself as the killer and Stu as his accomplice. Billy confesses they killed Maureen because the discovery of her affair with his father led to his mother's abandonment. The pair abducted Neil to frame him for their crimes and proceed to stab each other to depict themselves as the last survivors. However, they are distracted by Gale's return, allowing Sidney to incapacitate Billy and kill Stu by dropping a television set on his head. Billy nearly stabs Sidney but is shot by Gale. After Randy remarks that horror film killers revive for a final scare, Billy lunges for them, but Sidney shoots him in the head, killing him. As dawn breaks, Neil is rescued, Dewey is taken away by ambulance, and Gale provides an impromptu news report about the night's events.\n\nCast\nDavid Arquette as Dewey Riley: The goofy and hapless, but caring deputy sheriff\nNeve Campbell as Sidney Prescott: A strong and resilient high-schooler traumatized by the murder of her mother\nCourteney Cox as  Gale Weathers: A snarky and ruthless investigative journalist\nMatthew Lillard as Stu Macher: The eccentric and clumsy boyfriend of Tatum, and Billy's best friend\nRose McGowan as Tatum Riley: Sidney's spunky best friend and Dewey's younger sister\nSkeet Ulrich as Billy Loomis: Sidney's boyfriend, who has a passion for horror films\nJamie Kennedy as Randy Meeks: A horror film fanatic\nW. Earl Brown as Kenny: Gale's cameraman\nJoseph Whipp as Burke: The town sheriff\nLiev Schreiber as Cotton Weary: The man convicted of killing Sidney's mother\nDrew Barrymore as Casey Becker: A high-schooler\nScream also features Roger L. Jackson as the voice of Ghostface, and Kevin Patrick Walls as Steve Orth, Casey's boyfriend. Lawrence Hecht and Lynn McRee portray Sidney's parents, Neil and Maureen. C.W. Morgan appears as Hank Loomis, Frances Lee McCain portrays Mrs. Riley, and David Booth and Carla Hatley appear as Casey's father and mother. Leonora Scelfo portrays a \"bitchy\" cheerleader in the school bathroom. Scream features several cameo appearances, including Henry Winkler as principal Arthur Himbry, Linda Blair as Obnoxious Reporter, casting director Lisa Beach as a reporter, and director Wes Craven as Fred the janitor, an homage to iconic horror character Freddy Krueger.\n\nProduction\nWriting\nIn 1994, Kevin Williamson was a novice and financially struggling screenwriter, having recently sold his first script, Killing Mrs. Tingle (1999). While house-sitting, Williamson watched a Turning Point documentary about serial killer Danny Rolling which he said left him unsettled. Williamson later noticed an open window, armed himself with a knife, and called his friend for support. The pair began discussing horror characters that had resonated with them such as Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees. The following morning, Williamson was woken by a nightmare and used the experience as inspiration for the opening home invasion of Scream. He was also influenced by a one-act play he wrote in college about an unknown caller taunting a young girl.\nWilliamson spent the next three days writing a script for a slasher film he called Scary Movie while listening to the score to Halloween for further inspiration. He also drafted two five-page outlines for possible sequels. He developed much of the script around a single line of dialogue, \"movies don't create psychos, movies make psychos more creative\". This was his response to contemporary concerns about the influence of cinematic violence on audience, and he \"thought it was a great line\". Williamson's script drew upon many of his favorite horror films, such as Halloween (1978), Friday the 13th, Prom Night (both 1980), and A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984). At the time, the successful slasher films of the 1970s and 1980s had fallen out of favor, in part because of increasingly poorly received sequels to long-running horror franchises.\nHis characters were intentionally designed to be knowledgeable about these horror films and their typical elements, with the intention of creating a unique killer who was not only aware of horror film clichés but also exploited them for his own advantage. Williamson expressed his approach, \"I thought if you could expose the rules and play with them, then the audience doesn't know what they're going to get. Suddenly they're on edge. I started playing with the tropes, and the 'rules' were part of that.\" The opening scene depicting Casey Becker's death emulates that of Janet Leigh's character in Psycho (1960) by killing off a possible main character early on. Williamson believed it would hook studio executives and leave audiences unsure how the plot would progress. Williamson set the script in his hometown of Bayboro, North Carolina, believing its quiet atmosphere would provide a strong contrast with a serial killer's actions.\nWilliamson pursued Scary Movie because it was the type of horror film he enjoyed as a child but believed were no longer being made. Even so, he did not believe studios would develop and intended to use it to garner attention and secure other work. Williamson's agent had him scale back the gore, removing descriptions such as \"the insides are slowly rolling down her leg\", because it would make it difficult to sell the script. Williamson refused to cut any dialogue, however, believing it set it apart from similar films.\n\nDevelopment\nBy 1995, there was competition to secure the rights to Scary Movie, with early interest expressed by Morgan Creek Entertainment, Paramount Pictures, Universal Pictures, and filmmaker Oliver Stone. The script came to the attention of producer Cathy Konrad of Woods Entertainment, which had a development deal with production studio Miramax Films. She brought it to Richard Potter, the director of development for Miramax Films' genre-film-focused subsidiary Dimension Films. Potter expected a \"stupid spoof\" but was drawn in by the opening scene and recommended Miramax Films chairman, Bob Weinstein, pursue the rights. He agreed, considering it an opportunity to produce films instead of distributing those of others. Although others offered larger figures, Williamson's lawyer advised him take Weinstein's offer ($400,000–$500,000) because Dimension Films was willing to make the film immediately.\nWilliamson revised the script based on studio input, removing some gorier content (such as exposed internal organs and severed limbs) and adding the murder of principal Himbry because Weinstein said there was too long a period following the opening without any deaths. This solved a separate difficulty Williamson was having explaining why all but the core group of characters leave Stu's party in the finale, as they go to see Himbry's corpse. The Scary Movie title was also changed to Scream late in production because Weinstein was concerned Scary Movie would lead audiences to believe it was a comedy instead of a horror.\nThe search for a director was protracted, with Danny Boyle, Tom McLoughlin, Sam Raimi, George A. Romero, Bryan Singer, Quentin Tarantino, Robert Rodriguez, and Anthony Waller being considered. No agreements were secured because those approached for the role interpreted the script as a comedy instead of a horror satire. Wes Craven was discounted by the studio due to his lack of experience directing satires. Craven liked the script but he wanted to work on less gory and more mainstream content (including a film adaptation of the 1959 horror novel The Haunting of Hill House) because of the negative public perception of him based on his previous films.\nCraven's assistant Julie Plec and producer Marianne Maddalena continued to push Scream to Craven. His interest was renewed after The Haunting of Hill House adaptation was cancelled and he experienced the personal disappointment of his failed horror comedy, Vampire in Brooklyn (1995). After reading the script, Plec said Craven suggested the studio \"'make him an offer he can't refuse.' And so Dimension did. And he took it.\" The deal also offered Craven his choice of other projects to direct after Scream.\nWilliamson met Craven to discuss the script, believing he would request substantial rewrites, but Craven's notes related mainly to typos and some minor additions including restoring some of the gorier content and refining the ending which was not yet fully realized. Williamson said \"The story stayed pretty much intact, but we added some scares, and shortened it. Wes reworked some of the action sequences, and we would argue and go back and forth, but there's a point where I had to realize that Wes is more experienced than I am.\" Describing the script Craven said, \"what it forces you to do is sort of look at the reality of things we typically look at as amusing, like the Friday the 13th type of deaths where people have arrows through their heads and kids scream and laugh. But that suddenly starts happening in their actual lives.\"\n\nCasting\nAtypical for the genre at the time, Scream featured a cast of established stars, such as Drew Barrymore and Courteney Cox, as well as relatively unknown actors. Executive producer Cary Woods used his friendship with Barrymore's agent to cast her in the lead role of Sidney Prescott, but she later requested the smaller role of Casey Becker. Maddalena suggested that Barrymore had wanted to leave the project entirely, but took the smaller role to avoid disappointing Bob Weinstein and his brother Harvey. The filmmakers agreed to the change, believing it would be impactful to kill off their most well-known actor during Scream's opening and convince audiences that no character was safe. Vinessa Shaw and Reese Witherspoon were also considered for Sidney Prescott. Witherspoon was discounted because she looked too young compared to the other cast, and Williamson's choice, Molly Ringwald, believed she was too old for the part. The final choices came down to Alicia Witt, Brittany Murphy, and Neve Campbell. According to Williamson, Campbell swiftly emerged as the favored choice among the principal crew and, to improve her chances, they filmed her screen-test first, forcing the other contenders to try and surpass her performance. Beach and Maddalena said Campbell brought athleticism from her dancing background with a combination of strength and vulnerability. Describing what attracted her to the role, Campbell said Sidney was \"a fantastic character for any kind of movie\" who transitions from \"tormented, traumatized, insecure young woman to overwhelmingly empowered and strong\".\nWoods suggested Courteney Cox for the cold and calculating Gale Weathers, believing it would be interesting to play against her typical personable characters in series such as Family Ties (1982–1989) and Friends (1994–2004). Craven did not believe Cox could play the part and so she wrote a letter assuring him that \"being 'a bitch' wouldn't be a stretch at all\". Brooke Shields and Janeane Garofalo were considered but a more established actress was preferred. David Arquette auditioned for unspecified younger characters, but he was attracted to the role of Dewey and acting against Cox. The character was written as a \"dumb jock\" but Arquette interpreted it as a \"position of authority getting no respect ... He wants to be John Wayne ... He wants to be this tough guy, but he's just got a heart of gold.\" Rose McGowan's agent jeopardized her chance to play Tatum by insisting on a payment of $250,000 instead of the offered $50,000, which was lower than the $100,000 received by some other principal actors. As a result, McGowan had to reaudition for the role twice. McGowan influenced Tatum's design, dying her hair blonde to avoid having two dark-haired main female characters, removing an Indigo Girls poster from Tatum's bedroom (because she would not listen to the relatively older band), and rejecting costuming suggestions in favor of her self-bought outfits. Thora Birch and Natasha Lyonne also auditioned for the role; Lyonne was the preferred choice but, as she was under 18, could not consent to joining without parental permission.\nBelieving he was rising in popularity, Vince Vaughn was the studio's preferred choice for Billy Loomis, but he was too ill to audition. Skeet Ulrich did not attend auditions because of scheduling conflicts but his girlfriend did and mentioned Ulrich brought her; Beach went out to meet him personally. Ulrich liked playing a serial killer after more innocent and naive previous roles. To develop his character, Ulrich researched serial murders, psychological profiles, and outfitted one of his hotel rooms to the Billy persona to help him get into character, outfitting it with punk rock posters and blacklights. He said, \"I was into punk music in my teens and really just trying to recapture that angst ... I would sit in there and read about serial killers and watch Faces of Death (1978) ... anything to get into that gory mindset.\" Ulrich and Campbell starred together in The Craft (1996), which they believed fostered a natural relationship between their characters. Matthew Lillard auditioned for Billy, but the casting directors did not consider him the right actor to \"make out with [Campbell]\" and had him audition as Stu for Craven, who immediately offered him the part.\nSeth Green, Jason Lee, and Breckin Meyer were all preferred for Randy, the \"lanky, gangly, opinionated fifth wheel, who really has a love and passion for movies\", but Craven and Williamson appreciated the innocence and comedy that Jamie Kennedy brought to his portrayal. Kennedy credited Craven for supporting his casting. W. Earl Brown and Craven were friends and he was not required to audition but did have to gain about 20 lb (9.1 kg); he originally wanted to portray Dewey. Roger L. Jackson was hired based on his voice work for Mars Attacks! (1996). He recounted overhearing his competitors discussing the Ghostface as the \"new Freddy Krueger\", but Jackson interpreted it as a more subtle role which required charisma and sexiness to keep his target on the phone even though they want to hang up. Barrymore wanted someone to act against in her scene instead of the character's lines being read to her, and while the filmmakers intended to dub over Jackson's voice with Tom Kane, Craven liked his performance. Henry Winkler shared an agent with Craven and made his cameo appearance as a favor. Lynn McCree, Sidney's mother, was a Sonoma local; she spent two hours taking pictures with Campbell for the role but had no knowledge of the character's backstory. Liev Schreiber took the part of Cotton Weary for $20,000 during an unrelated meeting with Bob Weinstein. Extras were drawn from locals including the owners of a restaurant frequented by the cast and crew.\n\nPre-production\nIt was determined early on that Scream required too many different interior and exterior locations to be filmed on sets. Production designer Bruce Miller explained that it was important to portray the characters as vulnerable in their homes which made it essential that they could film inside and outside the properties. Scouts researched locations in the United States and Canada but struggled to locate a house for the opening scene which featured plentiful windows and visibility. Craven initially researched Wilmington, North Carolina but it failed to meet his expectations: \"I wanted to have very American looking houses ... and a lot of the houses there were very dark brown, or brick, and that didn't look attractive to me.\" Locations near Vancouver were discounted for similar reasons, as was Napa County, California.\nSanta Rosa in Sonoma County, California offered most features the filmmakers required, but the Weinsteins rejected the additional $1 to 2 million required to film there until the filmmakers convinced them that Craven's name would attract enough audiences to compensate for the added cost. The opening scene used a house in Glen Ellen. Miller said, \"We didn't want homes that looked like castles, or that you could really protect yourself in ... so if somebody was going to be stalking them, they could get to them very quickly.\" Other Santa Rosa locations used in Scream include Sidney's house at 1820 Calistoga Road, interiors of Tatum's house at 824 McDonald Avenue, and the Bradley Video store, where Randy works. The Healdsburg, California town square appears as the location of the Woodsboro Town Square, the fountain, and the exterior of the town police station.\nStu's home was an unoccupied property in Tomales which offered a dark and isolated atmosphere for the finale. Cinematographer Mark Irwin unsuccessfully argued against using the property because it was on top of a hill, introducing logistical challenges for accessing trailers and equipment. Miller built a facade of barns in front of the house so trailers could be sited closer while remaining concealed. The art department extensively modified the house, adding Gothic elements such as beams and stained-glass windows to give it a haunted feel, painting the walls red (although they realized later this made the blood stand out less), and adding a white picket fence. The farmhouse-style home offered a \"convoluted\" layout for a convincing setting where the murders could occur without the other characters realizing. The production crew also added a volleyball net to make it appear as if a teenager lived there.\nSanta Rosa High School was selected to portray Woodsboro High School due to its gothic and castle-like imposing visuals. Ten days of filming were to take place there in early June at a cost of $30,000 to 50,000, but permission was revoked in March 1996 by the Santa Rosa school district. The change was ostensibly because of the disruption filming would cause during school hours and scheduled exams, but several school board members objected to the violent content in the script, and hundreds of locals attended a council meeting to debate against and for the production; the board ultimately voted against allowing filming.\nThe Sonoma Community Center served as a replacement filming location, but scenes had to be rewritten to accommodate the new location and additional costs to transform the former elementary school into one appropriate for young adults, including larger desks and installing lockers. Craven estimated the disruption and location changes caused by the Santa Rosa district's decision cost the production $350,000, including the $27,000 the center was paid for three days of filming. The disruption to filming by the school was not forgotten, with the film's credits stating \"No thanks whatsoever to the Santa Rosa city school district governing board.\"\nWilliamson's script had not described the killer's appearance beyond wearing a \"ghostly white mask\". Special effects company KNB EFX Group was commissioned to design a mask, but the filmmakers disliked their \"gargoyle-ish\", witch, and goblin-like masks designs. While location scouting a house, Maddalena came across what would become the Ghostface mask. This mask, featuring a white shroud, was designed by Brigitte Sleiertin as \"the Peanut-Eyed Ghost\" for the novelty company Fun World in 1991, based on a design by makeup artist Loren Gitthens. However, Craven and the studio wanted to own the design used in the film and tasked KNB EFX with creating a similar but legally distinct design, stretching the nose and chin. Unhappy with the results, Craven eventually decided to pursue the original Fun World design. The killer's outfit was completed with a black shroud to avoid their clothing or movements hinting at their identity.\n\nFilming\nPrincipal photography began on April 15, 1996, on a $14 million budget. The first week was spent filming the Casey Becker scenes. To elicit the necessary emotions, Barrymore recalled a sad story developed with Craven and made herself hyperventilate. To enhance her performance, Jackson was situated outside the house so that he could see Barrymore while making the calls but she could not see him. Jackson was used similarly for other Ghostface call scenes, and never met the cast in person. He said \"the scariest monsters are the monsters you don't see, but the monsters you make in your mind. So just having the voice to react to made it larger in their minds\".\nFor safety, stunt performers portrayed the killer in costume, although Craven portrays the killer in parts of the opening. The first few days of filming used a custom mask designed for Scream, but Craven did not like it and reshot various scenes with the Fun World design before it was licensed. Because the hung Casey was to appear gutted from chest to waist, effects artist Howard Berger decided against applying prosthetics to Barrymore in favor of a mannequin that could be hollowed out, showing her spine holding her upper and lower parts together. The effect was enhanced with various rubber and vinyl guts. For Steve Orth's death, KNB created an open back chair allowing the actor to kneel behind a hollowed out anatomical mannequin torso cut open at the abdomen and filled with latex, rubber, and gelatin intestines.\nAfter viewing the dailies raw footage, Bob criticized the quality of Craven's work as \"workmanlike at best\", believing it lacked tension and had an inconsistent tone. He was critical of the Fun World Mask—believing it was \"flat\" and not scary—and ordered that the opening scene be re-filmed with alternative masks to see which worked best. Barrymore was also criticized for lacking sex appeal because of the pageboy hairstyle she had chosen. Williamson recounted Craven receiving a call from the brothers and seeing \"his back slump. He just started sliding down the chair.\" The studio considered firing Craven, and sent him dailies from other films, such as Nightwatch (1997), to demonstrate what they wanted for Scream.\nKonrad defended Craven to the brothers, and in response Bob Weinstein sent Dimension executives Cary Granat and Andrew Rona to the set to directly intervene. Craven, Konrad, Maddalena, and line producer Stuart M. Besser met with Granat, who wanted the opening reshot with each of the Weinstein's alternative mask suggestions. Instead, they offered to edit together the existing footage to prove the scene and mask worked and if it did not, then the project would be cancelled.\nEditor Patrick Lussier worked with Craven to piece together most of the opening, adding temporary music and sound effects. The Weinsteins barred Craven and the producers from attending screening of the footage. Afterward, Bob Weinstein told the filmmakers, \"What do I know about dailies? Keep going\", and provided additional financing. The producers suggested Weinstein had an \"ulterior motive\" to force the filmmakers to complete the footage – the upcoming Milan Film Festival, as edited footage was not typically allowed to be screened until eight weeks after filming concluded.\nThe next main scene filmed was of the central cast sitting around a fountain. Ulrich admitted he did not realize Scream was intended to be a horror with comedic elements and was confused by Lillard's and Kennedy's \"humorous moments\", believing they were \"ruining the movie ... Like, 'This isn't funny. This isn't supposed to be funny.' And man, was I wrong.\" Craven encouraged improvisation throughout filming, much of it coming from Arquette and Lillard, with Williamson acknowledging that Lillard's ad-libs improved the script.\n\nThe finale\nThe film's 42-minute end sequence set at Stu's party was filmed at night over three weeks. Issues filming at the location, including difficulties with providing proper lighting because of the uneven landscape, exacerbated tensions between Craven and Irwin regarding the quality of Irwin's footage. Scream was filmed with an anamorphic lens, which distorts and stretches the image to achieve a specific aspect ratio. However, neither Craven nor Irwin had much experience with this type of lens. The crew, including Lussier, had raised concerns about lens flares and out-of-focus images, partially blaming the focus puller hired by Irwin. Lussier explained, \"You can often tell your focus is supposed to be on somebody's eye usually,  ... and the focus puller just hasn't moved with the actor\". As a result, there were limited options during the editing process due to the inconsistent focus. Irwin said he was informed that all filmed footage was unusable and that 35 days of scenes needed to be reshot. After an argument with Maddalena, Irwin was immediately fired and replaced by Peter Deming for the final three weeks of filming. Irwin believed he was made a scapegoat for the film's behind-schedule status, risking Craven forfeiting his salary, but Konrad denied this.\nKennedy's horror rules scene was initially performed in a single take, but he requested additional takes, feeling he could enhance the performance (Craven ultimately chose the third take). During Tatum's death scene, McGowan had trouble staying in the pet door as the garage door rose. To address this, the crew nailed her shirt to the frame to hold her in place. Craven found it challenging managing the scene's tone, aiming to avoid trivializing Tatum's death while paying homage to other horror films. McGowan improvised the screams for her mother to give the character more humanity. When Gale drives a van with Kenny's corpse on top, Brown was on top of the van, but the unprepared stunt driver accelerated at full speed. When he hit the brakes, Brown fell off the side of the van and the stunt coordinator grabbed Brown's pants and ankle, saving him from harm.\nFive nights were spent on the kitchen confrontation between Billy, Stu, and Sidney. By the time they had filmed Gale returning with a gun, Ulrich said he and Lillard were \"roaming around like caged animals\" to keep the intensity of their performances high, to the point Craven asked them to relax because they were scaring Cox. Lillard described maintaining that level of adrenaline as exhausting. Campbell, Kennedy, Lillard, and Ulrich endured multiple nights covered in fake blood, and the costumes could not be washed to maintain continuity (they were dampened each night to make the blood appear fresh). When Ulrich stabs a sofa, the filmmakers were unaware it was stuffed with feathers which stuck to the fake blood; Maddalena considered Craven \"nuts\" for keeping the feathers in the scene. Lillard improvised lines such as \"My mom and dad are going to be so mad at me\" and \"You fucking hit me with the phone, you dick\", the latter taking place when Ulrich threw a phone near him as intended but the sticky blood caused it to veer off and inadvertently hit Lillard. Ulrich suggested Billy cracking his neck before shooting Gale, and the sound was added in post-production. Campbell's stuntwoman accidentally stabbed Ulrich with an umbrella tip, missing the protective vest he was wearing and hitting the site of an open heart surgery Ulrich had as a child.\nFilming concluded on June 14, 1996. The cast spoke fondly of the \"summer camp\" atmosphere during filming and the camaraderie they formed. The main cast and select crew members, including Craven, often gathered together in the early mornings after filming for meals, activities, and socializing. Arquette's hotel room was transformed into a makeshift club where they would congregate. However, due to complaints from other residents, they eventually relocated their early morning gatherings to a nearby barn.\n\nPost-production\nThe Scary Movie title remained late into production, appearing on the cast and crew gifts for completing filming. Harvey Weinstein suggested Scream based on the Michael and Janet Jackson song \"Scream\". Many of the cast and crew were initially unhappy with the change. Sony Pictures filed a lawsuit against Dimension and Miramax, claiming Scream infringed on their copyright of Screamers (1995). The case was settled out of court with Dimension being able to use Scream going forward. Although Arquette's and Kennedy's characters were killed in the script, alternate scenes were filmed showing them survive in case they proved popular with test screening audiences. The successful screenings also resulted in Miramax asking Craven to direct two Scream sequels.\nScream was rated NC-17 by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), restricting its audience to those over 17 years of age, which was considered \"box-office suicide\" by industry experts. The MPAA told Craven that Scream would never receive a more commercial R-rating, allowing younger people to see the film when accompanied by an adult. Craven said, \"I'm a director who can do something very well but am not allowed to put it on screen. And they ultimately get you, as they did on this one, on intensity. They say, 'it's not a specific shot, it's not blood, it's just too intense'\". The filmmakers eventually convinced the MPAA that Scream was a spoof, believing they were too focused on the horror aspects.\nIt took up to nine cuts to address the MPAA's complaints, including removing any movement of Steve Orth's internal organs, trimming Kenny's throat being slit (because the actor's pained expression was too \"disturbing\"), moving Billy and Stu stabbing each other off screen, and reducing scenes of Casey's hanging body and Tatum's crushed head. The slow motion stabbing of Casey was considered excessive but was allowed with only a few frames removed because there was no alternate footage to use. The final cut runs for 111 minutes.\n\nMusic\nDespite having no background in film scoring or an interest in the horror genre, Marco Beltrami was recommended to Plec and Craven, who found his music samples original compared with Beltrami's contemporaries. Craven gave Beltrami a weekend to compose \"The Cue from Hell\", the score for the film's opening sequence, which secured his hiring. Beltrami wrote the piece from Casey's perspective and used an \"operatic\" style, employing a range of instruments, including piano and brass. Beltrami described himself as \"bumbling\" through the scoring process, acknowledging his limited knowledge of horror music styles. He incorporated elements of the western genre, particularly for Dewey's theme, and took cues from composers including Elliot Goldenthal, Ennio Morricone, Eric Serra, Christopher Young, and Hans Zimmer.\nDue to budget constraints, Beltrami had to work with a small orchestra of fewer than 50 performers. To compensate for the lack of string harmonics, he instructed the string players to whistle, and asked Craven, Lussier, Maddalena, and Woods to join and boost their numbers. Beltrami identified most with Sidney's character and considered her theme – \"Sidney's Lament\" – to be one of the score's crucial pieces. He chose not to assign a distinctive motif to Ghostface, to avoid hinting at the killer's identity. Licensed music for Scream was provided by TVT Records and includes covers of \"(Don't Fear) The Reaper\" by Gus Black and \"Birds Fly (Whisper to a Scream)\" by Soho, \"School's Out\" by Alice Cooper, \"First Cool Hive\" by Moby, and \"Drop Dead Gorgeous\" by Republica. Excepts from the Halloween score are also present.\n\nRelease\nContext\nOver forty films were scheduled for release in late 1996, including Beavis and Butt-Head Do America, Jerry Maguire, Mars Attacks!, Ransom, Space Jam, and Star Trek: First Contact. Bob Weinstein opted to release Scream in December as counterprogramming, offering teenagers an alternative to more traditional holiday fare. The decision was unpopular with the cast and crew, with Williamson expecting the film to fail. Weinstein explained, \"people said we were crazy to put out Scream over Christmas ... It was a thriller; it didn't have big stars; it couldn't compete. Well, after Beavis and Butt-Head, where is that audience going to go?\"\nThe marketing for Scream positioned Barrymore as the lead character to intentionally shock the audience with her death. During a promotional interview, Ulrich inadvertently revealed he portrayed one of the killers and called his agent to get the story blocked.\n\nBox office\nThe premiere of Scream took place on December 18, 1996, at the AVCO theater in Westwood, Los Angeles. It was released in the United States and Canada on December 20. During its opening weekend, the film grossed $6.4 million across 1,413 theaters—an average of $4,497 per theater—making it the fourth-highest-grossing film of the weekend, behind 101 Dalmatians ($7 million), Jerry Maguire ($13.1 million), and the debut of Beavis and Butt-Head Do America ($20.1 million). The performance was considered a failure by industry professionals, resulting in Variety labeling Scream \"dead on arrival\". Maddalena recounted herself and Craven observing a raucous audience for Beavis and Butt-Head Do America while Scream had \"maybe seven people in there. No one was laughing or screaming. We went away so dejected.\" However, Scream received positive audience word-of-mouth and exit-polling responses, leading the studio to increase the marketing and distribution budget. This contributed to Scream's performance improving in the following weeks. Although it fell to fifth place in its second weekend, it increased its weekend gross to $9.1 million, and again in its third weekend, rising to third place with $10 million. Scream remained in the top-ten-highest-grossing films for nine weeks in total, becoming a surprise success and grossing a total of $103 million. This figure made it the number 13 highest-grossing film of 1996, and highest-grossing slasher film of its time, until Halloween (2018). It was Miramax's second film to gross $100 million in the United States and Canada after Pulp Fiction (1994). The film was most successful with teenagers and young people in their 20s.\nOutside of the U.S. and Canada, Scream is estimated to have grossed a further $70 million, including $14 million in the United Kingdom, making it the number 21 highest-grossing film. This gives Scream a cumulative worldwide total of $173 million, making it the number 14 highest-grossing film of the year. After four weeks of release, it became the highest-grossing horror film in France, with a gross of $6.2 million (37.9 million French Francs). In Japan, the release date was postponed from May 1997 to August after the murder of a 14-year-old boy, whose killer was apparently obsessed with horror movies.\nIndustry analysis showed that most of the films released toward the end of the year were box office failures, including both big-budget fare and a surge of films targeted toward women. Only a few were seen as successes, including 101 Dalmatians, Beavis and Butt-Head Do America, Jerry Maguire, Ransom, Scream, and Star Trek: First Contact. The success of Scream resulted in additional financial compensation for the principal crew and cast, triggered by the box office surpassing $40 million and subsequent increments of $10 million up to $100 million. Kennedy noted that his first residual check was double his salary.\n\nReception\nCritical response\nScream received generally positive reviews. Critics, such as Roger Ebert, James Berardinelli, and Owen Gleiberman, praised Scream's meta commentary about its horror predecessors and its self-referential humor while also writing that the self parody diluted any suspense, and criticizing the excessive violence. Some critics said that the film's intelligence and wit beneath the gore would be appreciated by \"sophisticated viewers\", but Ebert was unsure if the degree of violence was \"defused by the ironic way the film uses it and comments on it\".\nJanet Maslin wrote that while Scream offered original ideas for the genre, it quickly exhausted them. John Hartl offered a similar sentiment, believing Scream was so focused on referencing other films that it did not know when to \"settle down to tell a coherent story\". Bill Stamets considered these references insightful, particularly the killers' motives, saying \"Killers without motives are far more scary.\"\nCritics such as Berardinelli, Thomas, and Leonard Klady wrote positively of the ensemble cast and their instrumentality in the film's success. Peter Stack and Dave Kehr praised Campbell for her standout performance that successfully carried the central focus on her character, portraying a tough, capable heroine who avoids the \"damsel in distress\" archetype. While some reviewers appreciated Cox for delivering a strong performance in an against-type role, others criticized her for being unconvincing as a tough and career-obsessed reporter. Thomas and John Hartl wrote that Arquette delivered a \"goofily charming\" performance. Lisa Alspector described Ulrich as the only cast member capable of balancing genuine characterization with self-parody.\nThe film's opening sequence received praise for building tension and suspense. Gleiberman and Richard Harrington appreciated the absence of gratuitous nudity in the scene, which was atypical for the genre. Kevin Thomas credited Irwin's \"resourcefulness\" and Lussier's \"razor-sharp\" editing as key to Scream's success.\n\nAccolades\nAt the 23rd Saturn Awards in 1997, Scream won awards for Best Actress (Campbell), Best Writing (Williamson), and Best Horror Film. The film was named Best Movie at the MTV Movie Awards, and Campbell was nominated for Best Female Performance. Scream was named Best Film by the International Horror Guild. Craven also received the Grand Prize at the Gérardmer Film Festival.\n\nPost-release\nHome media\nThe soundtrack of Scream was released in December 1996 by TVT Records as Scream: Music From The Dimension Motion Picture; it sold poorly. Scream was released on VHS and Laserdisc in June 1997, and was especially successful in the video rental market, becoming the second most rented film of 1997 in the United States. In 2000, Scream was released as part of \"The Ultimate Scream Collection\", alongside its then-two sequels, Scream 2 (1997) and Scream 3 (2000). The release introduced special features including cast screen tests, outtakes, and a documentary about the making of the three films featuring interviews with Craven, Williamson, Campbell, Cox, and Arquette. A director's cut release of Scream restored uncut sequences removed for the theatrical release.\nThe film was released on Blu-ray in 2011, including previously released special features. For the film's 25th anniversary in 2021, Scream was remastered and released on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray in a steelbook case. Alongside the previously released special features, the remastered version included \"A Bloody Legacy: Scream 25 Years Later\", a documentary featuring new interviews with the cast and crew. In 2022, Varèse Sarabande released the score in a limited-edition six-disc box CD set and digitally, alongside Beltrami's work on other installments, as well as unreleased music, demos, and alternate versions. A four-LP record set was released separately in a jacket that turns into a Ghostface mask.\n\nOther media\nA 2011 documentary, Still Screaming: The Ultimate Scary Movie Retrospective, documents the production of the original trilogy of Scream films, and includes interviews with cast and crew from throughout the series. A book, It All Began With A Scream by Padraic Maroney, was also released that year, offering a similar look at the production of Scream and its three immediate sequels.\nThe popularity of the Ghostface character generated a variety of merchandise, and the killer's outfit remained a popular Halloween costume as of 2023.\n\nThematic analysis\nThemes\nScream is influenced by, and pays many homages to, the history of the horror genre, including a school janitor referencing Freddy Krueger, a cameo appearance by Linda Blair, famed for her appearance in The Exorcist (1973), and the killers admonishing the police for not watching Prom Night for advice. In a meta reference, Randy recounts the rules of the genre: to survive a horror film, characters cannot sin by drinking, taking drugs, or having sex, and they cannot say \"'I'll be right back.' Because you won't be back\". This self reference is extended when Randy (Jamie Kennedy), watches Halloween and yells at the lead character Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) to look behind her, oblivious to the killer approaching himself from behind. Further, Kenny futilely yells at Randy to look behind him while observing via a remote camera. When Sidney confronts Billy and Stu, she says \"You've seen one too many movies\", to which Billy replies \"Movies don't create psychos, movies make psychos more creative.\" Writer Kate Gardener believed this dialogue rejects the blame on horror films for inspiring real-world violence. Lussier said the MPAA had objected to this dialogue because \"you can't speak that kind of truth\".\nWriters Adam White and Michelle Delgado wrote that Scream is an exploration of the \"exploitative\" nature of the news media using traumatic events as entertainment. The debut of Scream coincided with growing discourse in the United States on the impact of on-screen violence and its potential consequences for society. During this time, the Clinton administration introduced the V-chip, a device designed to enable parents to block mature television content. However, news programs remained exempt from the ratings system, which Delgado said continued to \"exploit\" violent incidents to captivate audiences. Gale portrays a relentless television reporter who used Maureen's murder to further her own career and seeks to do the same with the Woodsboro murders. Although Gale advocates for the innocence of Cotton Weary in Maureen's death, she does so both because she believes he is innocent and to secure a lucrative book deal. While Gale's actions revolve around profiting from the suffering of others, she is depicted not as a villain but a careerist and an antagonist to Sidney who evolves into a heroic figure, aiding in the deaths of Billy and Stu. Gardener wrote that making a living from murder is not morally equal to committing murder, but that it represents the commodification of crime and female trauma. Scream acknowledges the audience's voyeuristic interest in murder and horror, underscoring the monetary value placed on sensationalized crimes.\nWhite described Williamson's script as emblematic of its time, featuring a \"picture-perfect\" mother raped and murdered in American suburbia and the stalking of her daughter one year later. He compared it to contemporary sensationalized cases such as the Murder trial of O. J. Simpson, Lorena Bobbit's assault of her husband, the Long Island Lolita case, and the Gainesville Ripper. The Ripper's defence included his assertion of being influenced by films such as The Exorcist III (1990). Despite public concerns about the influence of violent media, instances of violent crime were decreasing when Scream was released and there remained no direct link between violent media content and real-life crimes. Even so, public fascination with these media portrayals created a form of celebrity for the victims or perpetrators, with dramatic events being turned into documentaries and films. In Scream, Sidney jokes that a film will be made about the traumatic events of her life and, in the sequels, the film-within-a-film Stab horror series is created, based partly on the events of each preceding Scream entry.\n\nAnalysis\nAuthor Padraic Maroney wrote that Scream was pro-feminism, depicting several final girls who fight the killer instead of submitting. The success of Scream demonstrated to studios that although typically seen as fare for young males, horror films had an untapped female market. Writer Aime Simon said Sidney, like Craven's Nancy Thompson, is allowed to develop as a character by surviving successive films. The Scream films often explore female trauma through characters such as Sidney and Gale, including the dangers posed by angry males who feel rejected. Gardener said that although this may not have been Craven's intention, the film's narrative effectively conveys this theme. She continued that the male killers in Scream enact violence and intimidation primarily on women, including Casey who romantically rejects Stu before the events of the film, and Sidney's mother Maureen, as Billy blames her for the end of his parents' marriage. Maureen is not responsible for his mother leaving, but Billy blames her, takes his anger out on her directly, and then abuses Sidney's emotional vulnerability caused by her death. In this way, the portrayal of Billy and Stu as angry entitled men seeking revenge is more relatable and realistic than supernatural horror villains.\nScream has been analyzed for homosexual or queer undertones, influenced by Williamson's own experiences as a gay man. He has expressed how his personal struggles informed Sidney's character because he identified parallels between her survival tactics and those of young gay individuals. In a 2021 interview, he said \"as a gay kid, I related to the final girl and to her struggle because it's what one has to do to survive as a young gay kid, too. Subconsciously, I think the Scream movies are coded in gay survival.\" Several publications have highlighted the positive response from gay fans of the franchise to these underlying themes.\nSome writers, such as Maroney, Brant Lewis, and Joe Lipsett, have discussed the theory that Billy and Stu are in a homosexual relationship or that Stu held unrequited feelings for Billy. Professor David Greven wrote that Billy and Stu are representative of the changing notions of masculinity and the underlying currents of queer desire in 90s films. The interactions between them throughout the movie contain themes of homoeroticism, such as when Stu playfully touches Randy's earlobe or leans on Billy during the climax before they stab each other with phallic weapons. Greven believed that although it is easy to assign homosexuality to Stu because of his lack of motive to kill and apparent willingness to please his friend, Billy also features homoerotic characteristics such as the gay trope of fixating on his maternal relationship, similar to Norman Bates in Psycho, and Billy's visual styling resembling actor James Dean, considered a queer icon. Williamson loosely based the characters on Leopold and Loeb, queer individuals who committed murder to prove their intellectual superiority. In a 2022 interview he said he was \"very hesitant to present the gay side of me in [Scream]\" and that any queerness in Billy's and Stu's characters was \"a little coded and maybe accidental\".\n\nLegacy\nCultural influence\nIn the decades following its release, Scream has remained an enduringly popular horror film and launched a successful film franchise. It is credited with revitalizing the horror genre, which had significantly declined in popularity by the early 1990s. Far Out and MTV described Scream as a \"ground-breaking\" slasher film that \"successfully crossed over into the mainstream\" because of its deft blend of traditional horror with self-aware commentary and satire. Vox wrote that Scream \"mainstreamed metatextual storytelling and made that analytical understanding of the genre mainstream in a lot of ways\".\nStudios rushed to capitalize on Scream's success with teen-centric horror films and television series leading into the 2000s, such as I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997), Urban Legend, The Faculty (both 1998), Final Destination, and Cherry Falls (both 2000), as well as sequels to popular, but diminished, franchises such as Halloween H20: 20 Years Later and Bride of Chucky (both 1998). Scream also serves as the subject of the parody film Scary Movie (2000), which in turn launched its own franchise of horror spoofs. Director Jordan Peele has credited Scream as a direct inspiration for his own influential horror film, Get Out (2017), in manipulating the audience's expectations of the contemporary horror genre.\nScream helped launch or bolster the careers of its principal stars, including Campbell, Ulrich, Lillard, McGowan, Kennedy, and Arquette. Williamson became an in-demand screenwriter, contributing to horror films such as I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997) and television series Dawson's Creek (1998–2003). Scream helped revitalize Craven's career after several career setbacks and a string of poor performances. Lussier credited his work on Scream's opening with his transition to director, beginning with Dracula 2000 (2000). Barrymore's involvement helped raised the profile of the horror genre, making it a more attractive prospect for prominent actors instead of relative unknowns. In a 2021 interview, Kennedy said he was still approached by fans about his horror rules monologue. Lillard described Scream as a \"seminal\" moment of his career. He and Campbell began a two-year relationship during filming, while Cox and Arquette married and eventually divorced.\nScream has often been referenced in popular culture in and outside the horror genre. The Ghostface killer is considered to be among the most iconic cinematic horror villains. The Billy and Stu version of Ghostface (voiced by Jackson) appears as a playable character in the fighting game Mortal Kombat 1 (2023). As of 2021, Lillard's improvised dialogue, \"My mom and dad are gonna be so mad at me\", was still quoted to him by fans.\nIn the years since its release, Scream was cited as an influence in several violent crimes and murders, with perpetrators sometimes dressing as Ghostface, as in the 2006 murder of Cassie Jo Stoddart. Following the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, an increasing media and public scrutiny on the influence of violent films, games, and other media on society the United States Senate Commerce committee reviewed the marketing of films to youths, specifically the horror genre. Scream's opening was shown as an example of negative media which may be viewed by children. The use of Caller ID to identify incoming callers also increased by 300% following Scream's release.\n\nRetrospective assessments\nScream is regarded as a classic of the horror genre, and among the greatest horror and slasher films ever made. Several publications have also listed it among the best films of the 1990s. Williamson believed Scream's success was due, in part, to fitting the contemporary zeitgeist when \"everyone wanted to have scary and fun in their life ... If the movie had been released at any other time, I'm not sure that would've been the case\". Campbell believed it connected with audiences because of a deft combination of humor, horror, and intelligence. As of 2023, Scream remains the highest-grossing film in the Scream film series, and is generally considered to be the best film in the series. The franchise is also among the highest-grossing horror franchises, alongside Halloween, Saw, and The Conjuring Universe.\nIn 2008, Empire ranked the film number 482 on its list of \"The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time\", and Entertainment Weekly listed Scream as one of the Best High School movies and among the best films of the preceding 13 years. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 77% from the aggregated reviews of 122 critics, with an average score of 7.1/10. The consensus reads: \"Horror icon Wes Craven's subversive deconstruction of the genre is sly, witty, and surprisingly effective as a slasher film itself, even if it's a little too cheeky for some\". The film has a score of 66 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 25 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". The British Film Institute (BFI) called the opening scene \"one of the all-time great pre-credit scenes—an unforgettable masterclass of building tension, heart-stopping terror, and shocking images\". The scene appeared at number 13 on Bravo's 2004 list of the 100 Scariest Movie Moments.\n\nSequels\nDue to the success of Scream, development of a sequel began while the original was still in theaters. Scream 2 (1997) achieved similar financial and critical success as Scream. Williamson was unavailable to write Scream 3 (2000), the trilogy's concluding chapter, and was replaced with Ehren Kruger. The film fared less well than its predecessors, commercially and critically, and is regarded as the franchise's most divisive entry. Williamson returned to the series with the reboot film Scream 4 (2011). While Scream 4 has been positively reassessed since its release, its modest box office and critical reception on its release, as well as Craven's death, placed the franchise on hold.\nA television adaptation, Scream (2015–2019), ran for three seasons. The Weinsteins refused to license the Fun World costume for the show or allow references to the films, which was controversial with fans and contributed to the series' low ratings, poor reception, and eventual cancellation.\nThe film series was relaunched with Scream (2022), and its success led to immediate development of a sixth installment, Scream VI (2023). Both films are directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, and written by James Vanderbilt and Guy Busick. These films focus on a younger cast, including Melissa Barrera and Jenna Ortega, with Campbell, Cox, and Arquette appearing in supporting legacy roles. Scream VI was the first film in the series not to feature Campbell, who declined to return following a dispute over pay, or Arquette. Scream 7 began filming in January 2025, with Campbell reprising her role and Kevin Williamson directing.\n\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\nWorks cited\nFrench, Lawrence (January 1996). \"Wes Craven's Scream\".

    "text": "Grow Up, Tony Phillips is a 2013 comedy film by American director Emily Hagins and her fourth feature film. It was first released on October 31, 2013, at the South by Southwest film festival and stars Tony Vespe as Tony Phillips, a young teenager's love for Halloween. Unlike her prior feature-length films, Grow Up, Tony Phillips does not feature any supernatural elements seen in past films such as Pathogen or My Sucky Teen Romance.\n\nSynopsis\nTony (Tony Vespe) is conflicted. He loves Halloween, but this year all of his high school friends have decided that Halloween is too juvenile for him. What is Tony to do when nobody his age really understands what Halloween means to him?\n\nCast\nTony Vespe as Tony Phillips\nCaleb Barwick as Mikey\nDevin Bonnée as Craig\nA. J.

While writing the script, Hagins wanted to focus on the transition between adult and child that occurs with Halloween, which she felt was often overlooked in many films. The script was a departure the genre from her previous films, as the dark tones depressed her and Hagins wanted to \"a movie that had no genre at all\". In 2012 A. J. Bowen was confirmed to be performing in the film. Filming began in mid-November 2012 in Austin, Texas. Hagins experienced some difficulty with shooting, as some businesses already had Christmas decorations up but decided to work them into the script as a plot point.\n\nReception\nCritical reception for Grow Up, Tony Phillips was mostly positive. Common criticisms revolved around the film's storytelling, as some reviewers such as Film School Rejects felt that there were \"some serious story elements that are left dangling in all but the most superficial ways\", which interfered with a film that they otherwise enjoyed. Hagins received praise for the film's acting and for what the Daily Texan saw as \"genuine truths about how high school can dissolve the most intense friendships\". Vox and Twitch Film both gave mostly positive reviews, with Twitch Film praising the movie's cinematography and film score.\n\nSee also\nList of films set around Halloween\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nGrow Up, Tony Phillips at IMDb",

    "title": "We answer to a higher authority",
    "text": "We answer to a higher authority is a slogan used by Hebrew National, now a subsidiary of ConAgra Foods, for its brand of kosher-certified hot dogs and processed meats, which portrays the products as being of a higher quality than other, similar products. A 1997 article in The New York Times called the campaign \"among the longest running and best known ever\".\nIn a 2009 article The National Hot Dog and Sausage Council cited statistics indicating that three-quarters of the six million Americans who prefer kosher hot dogs are not themselves Jewish. In 2010, The New York Times wrote that Hebrew National's hot dogs \"aren't kosher enough for most Jews who keep kosher\".\n\nAdvertising campaigns\nThe slogan dates back to 1965, and has been used since then as a means to market the product to Jews and non-Jews as a superior product. Some of the campaign's earliest television advertisements, created by Scali, McCabe, Sloves in 1972, featured Uncle Sam preparing to consume a hot dog that includes the additives and fillers permitted under federal regulations, while an ethereal narrator states that Hebrew National cannot, panning up to the heavens and stating because \"we answer to a higher authority\", and appeared sporadically for nearly two decades.\nA 1992 revision featured a supposed competitor named \"Frank Wiener\" who must answer to the higher authority himself for producing inferior products that didn't match the quality of those manufactured by Hebrew National.\nA 1997 campaign developed by New York City firm Grey Advertising featured Robert Klein as an all-knowing hot dog vendor with an ethereally shiny cart, purveying both hot dogs and words of deep wisdom. The campaign played on the nostalgia for the company's earlier television advertisements with a touch of humor. In various spots in the campaign, a single man is guided to his future wife, the finder of a bag full of money is told to return the loot and is rewarded with winning the lottery and a customer who asks if the vendor accepts credit cards is told by the character that \"I take credit for everything\". The $5 million campaign, double the previous year's budget, would feature ads broadcast in its traditional markets, as well as in cities such as Baltimore, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Arizona and San Francisco, where the products were popular but had not been directly targeted in previous campaigns.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "Virsa Singh Valtoha is a former SIkh militant and Indian politician belonging to Shiromani Akali Dal party. He is a former member of the Punjab Legislative Assembly who represented Khem Karan.\n\nFamily and early life\nHis father's name is Sohan Singh. Virsa Singh Valtoha's son's name is Mr. Gauravdeep Singh, who is advocate at Punjab And Haryana High Court. He is also the president of SOI (Student Organization Of India) from Majha Zone (Punjab).\n Valtoha received training in being a granthi, but chose to pursue higher education instead. In 1981 Valtoha was unable to pass first year English examination for his bachelor of arts. Valtoha joined the Communist Party of India (Marxist) youth-wing out of frustration, but in 1982 he left and joined the All India Sikh Student Federation instead.\n\nMilitancy\nAfter joining the AISSF Valtoha came in contact with Kewal Singh, cousin of AISSF president Amrik Singh, who took him to the Golden Temple. According to Valtoha he began to routinely visit the Temple and grew closer to Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. He would engage in volunteer work for the AISSF.\nIn November 1982 Harminder Singh Sandhu, AISSF general secretary, asked Valtoha to join a company of youths in throwing bombs at the house of Punjab education minister Harcharan Singh Ajnala. Valtoha would do as asked along with Anokh Singh.\nDuring the Asian Games in 1982 Valtoha and others were given the task to throw leaflets and bombs, but were unsuccessful.\nAfter this incident Valtoha \"proved his worth\" and he became a regular participant of Bhindranwale's hit squads. In March 1983 Sandhu told Valtoha that a case had been registered against him in relation to an explosion in Delhi. This convinced Valtoha to abandon his studies and to live with Bhindranwale's men in Guru Ram Das Serai. He became an AISSF office secretary as well.\nOn February 16, 1983, Valtoha and Anokh Singh were sent by Sandhu and Ranjinder Singh Mehta to kill police inspector Bua Dass. Anokh Singh supplied the weapons. Valtoha and Anokh stalked Bua Dass and shot at him as he went on a walk with his brother. Bua Dass would be killed, but Valtoha would not shoot. On hearing Valotha did not fire Bhindwale who \"...was otherwise in a very happy mood, felt a little annoyed with me (Valtoha).\"\nOn March 5 Sandhu and Satinderjit Singh instructed Valtoha to throw bombs and pamphlets during a non-aligned meet in Delhi. On March 7 Valtoha and others threw pamphlets in multiple places including Gurdwara Bangla Sahib and the letter boxes of the USA and Saudi Arabia embassies. Another group of militants threw bombs at Palika Bazar and Inter-State Bus Terminal injuring 7.\nIn January 1984 Bhindranwale, in a sign of Valtoha having joined the inner-circle of AISSF, would give Valtoha a .38 revolver. In February Gurinder Singh Bhola, Mathura Singh, Surjeet Singh, and Valtoha attempted to rob Syndicate Bank in Amritsar, but would be unsuccesful.\nOn March 19, 1984, the AISSF was banned and Harbans Singh Manchanda, president of Delhi Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee, supported the decision. Amarjeet Singh Chawla, Bhola, and Valtoha were instructed to kill Manchanda in revenge. Valtoha and fellow militants stole a car in Delhi and tailed Manchanda's vehicle on the 28th. As Manchanda had stopped at a red light in his car. Bhola and Valtoha walked to opposite sides and fired at Manchanda. Bhola fired 14 bullets while Valtoha fired 6 killing Manchanda and injuring two other occupants. Bhindranwale was greatly pleased with this and forgave Valtoha of his past discretions.\nIn May 1984 Valtoha, Bhola, Chawla, Labh Singh, and Dalbir Singh Fauji conspired to kill former Punjab chief minister Darbara Singh to fulfill Bhindranwale's personal wish. The plan would not materialize due to Bhola's arrest. In the same month Amrik Singh, Bhindranwale, and Sandhu plotted to hijack a plane in Srinagar, but would not occur. \nValtoha would be arrested during Operation Bluestar.\n\nPolitical career\nValtoha first became involved in the All India Sikh Student Federation during the time of Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. During this period he was allegedly behind multiple killings and bomb blasts. Valtoha was elected to the Punjab Legislative Assembly from the Valtoha constituency in 2007. During the 2012 Punjab election, Valtoha constituency underwent boundary delimitation. Valtoha then successfully contested the Punjab Assembly seat from Khem Karan. Valtoha served as an MLA from 2007-2017 and a chief parliamentary secretary from 2012-2017. He was a member of the Akali Dal top-decision making body.\n\nControversies\nFor using casteist remark\nValtoha has been accused of insulting dalits (a historically discriminated community of lower caste people placed at the end of the caste pyramid, who constitute 36% of the states population in India), by a member of an opposition party in the legislature. Due to a casteist slur by Virsa Singh Valtoha, former Ravidassia M.L.A. Tarlochan Singh Soondh hurled a shoe towards Valtoha in the Punjab State Legislative Assembly\nGiani Harpreet Singh also accused Virsa Singh Valtoha of issuing threats to his family, abducting his daughter, and raising caste remarks against him for being a Dalit Sikh.\n\nElectricity theft by Valtoha family\nIn March 2020, Virsa Singh Valtoha was fined ₹1.9 lakh for electricity theft at his residence in Amarkot, near Tarn Taran, Punjab. The Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) conducted a raid and discovered that Valtoha's property was illegally drawing power. The sanctioned load was 4.85 kW, but the actual consumption was 11 kW, with unauthorized connections bypassing the meter. Additionally, the team found wires connected directly from a transformer, indicating deliberate power theft.\n\nClaiming B. R. Ambedkar Fanned Casteism\nDuring a TV discussion in 2016, Valtoha accused Dr. B. R. Ambedkar of promoting casteism by advocating reservations. This remark drew sharp backlash from the AAP, which demanded legal action and later saw public protests in Tarn Taran, including effigy burning.\n\nThreats to Officials - Video Goes Viral\nIn 2017, a video circulated showing Valtoha allegedly threatening Tarn Taran’s Deputy Commissioner (DC) and police officers. He warned them against harassing Akali workers, stating he had taken note of names and would act accordingly. The Congress condemned the act as intimidation of officials.\n\nElectoral performance\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "La Colosa mine",
    "text": "La Colosa is a porphyry gold mine in Colombia. The mine is located in Cajamarca, Tolima on the eastern flanks of the Central Ranges of the Colombian Andes. La Colosa has estimated inferred resources of 24,000,000 ounces (680 t) of gold, grading at 0.9 to 1.0 milligram per kilogram (1.4×10−5 to 1.6×10−5 oz/lb) of Au. In 2015, the mine produced 1,810.35 grams (63.858 oz) of gold. In 2016, 88.4% of the mining value in Colombia came from coal and gold combined, with nickel following at 9.3%.\n\nDescription\nLa Colosa, covering an area of 600 square kilometres (230 sq mi), is the second major greenfield discovery in Colombia, after Gramalote and believed to have a potential of producing between 800,000 and 1,200,000 ounces (23 and 34 t) of gold per year for 20 years. La Colosa gold project, started in 2006, is based on low-grade porphyry copper deposits containing a small amount of gold. Gold grains in the deposit are found both liberated and locked in sulphides and silicates. The gold mineralization in the deposit is attributed to porphyry intrusions into the Paleozoic schists of the Cajamarca Complex on the eastern flank of the Central Ranges of the Colombian Andes, around 8 Ma. Gold mineralization is believed to have occurred over three early phases of intrusion, which are accompanied by a series of potassic and sodic-calcic alteration events and a late phase of dacite porphyry intrusions.\n\nProject Suspension\nDespite the multiple investments made by the Multinational AngloGold Ashanti in favor of the community, including building sports fields among other infrastructures that local governments never developed; the community promoted a popular consultation in order to balance the general opinion of the community, regarding whether or not to give their consent for the development of the project. This, to the extent that beyond the economic advantages mentioned by the Multinational, there were deep disagreements highlighted by various environmentalists, led by citizen Renzo García, the carnival marcha creator, who stated that in their opinion, the generation of environmental liabilities, the contamination and the destruction of the territory would not have any equivalent in the presumed advantages used by the company. In this regard, AngloGold pointed out that the project was an opportunity to strengthen the productive industries of the region. However, beyond both positions, the community finally rejected the project by voting in a popular consultation, a tool available to date in the Colombian legal system. To date it is estimated that the project could be reactivated, to which environmentalists such as Renzo García maintain opposition.\n\nSee also\nList of mining areas in Colombia\nQuinchía mine\nCerro Matoso mine\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nArango Mendoza, Julián Andrés (2014), Proyecto de minería de oro La Colosa, Identificación ambiental de la zona de explotación y sus Impactos (PDF), Universidad La Javeriana, pp. 1–209, retrieved 2017-04-07\n\nMaps\nMosquera T., Dario; Nuñez T., Alberto; Vesga, C.

    "text": "David J. Dennis is a civil rights activist whose involvement began in the early 1960s. Dennis grew up in the segregated area of Omega, Louisiana.  He worked as a co-director of the Council of Federated Organizations (COFO), as director of Mississippi's Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), and as one of the organizers of the Mississippi Freedom Summer of 1964. Dennis worked closely with both Bob Moses and Medgar Evers as well as with members of SNCC, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. His first involvement in the Civil Rights Movement was at a Woolworth sit-in organized by CORE and he went on to become a Freedom Rider in 1961. Since 1989, Dennis has put his activism toward the Algebra Project, a nonprofit organization run by Bob Moses that aims to improve mathematics education for minority children. Dennis also speaks publicly about his experiences in the movement through an organization called Dave Dennis Connections.\n\nEarly life\nDave Dennis was born in 1940 on a plantation of a sharecropper in Omega, Louisiana. All he knew was a life of segregation, he says in one interview with Ebony magazine, \"I grew up in this life where you had to stay in your place.\" Dennis grew up extremely poor, in the Shreveport area where people did not have even the most basic utilities and he did not know what it was like to have these basic utilities until he was nine years old. Even after Dennis' family moved to the inner city of Louisiana, black citizens, including his family, were \"only able to get basic utilities by entering white territory.\" He was the first of his family to graduate from high school. He graduated from Southern High School which was connected to Southern University where the beginnings of student protests were forming. Dennis during this time in his life wasn't interested in being a part of any protests or demonstrations, he says, \"I didn’t have this interest in civil rights that you might think most people are born with\". He did not want any part of the civil rights activism, \"Things were happening [in the country] and I was trying to run from them”.\n\nCareer\nDave Dennis attended Dillard University in New Orleans and continued to ignore the civil rights protests until he met Doris Castle, who supported the movement, and became involved with the movement through her. \"She was handing out meeting flyers and speaking to a group of students on campus one afternoon. I thought she was cute, walked over to talk to her after her presentation and, sooner than I realized, agreed to attend a CORE demonstration,\" Dennis said. This was Dennis' first demonstration, as part of a sit-in at a Woolworth store in New Orleans. \n\nDennis was one of the Freedom Riders to continue the original Freedom Ride from Alabama to Jackson, Mississippi in 1961. The freedom ride was the turning point in his activism. Dennis dropped out of school and started this new path of his life, although he eventually received his Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees from Dillard University and a Juris Doctor from the University of Michigan Law School. Dennis established CORE presence in Mississippi. He helped his local community by setting up a Home Industry Cooperative in Ruleville, which consisted of eighteen local women who made rugs, quilts, and aprons to sell to northern civil rights supporters. Dennis also spent time in Hattiesburg where he met a local woman, Mattie Bivins, whom he married.\nDennis was frustrated with CORE's lack of support in Mississippi, however, CORE wasn't pleased with Dennis’ strategie. The organization was not pleased because Dennis did not care which organization got the credit for the successes of the movement, yet CORE still valued Dave Dennis. Dennis wanted to establish a voter registration drive in Madison County, Mississippi, as Dennis believed it was an optimal location for a CORE project because Black people made up a majority of the county's population. Dennis proposed to CORE that Canton was in close proximity to Tougaloo College, which made it possible to involve college students in the voter registration drive. CORE agreed, but after two years of violence from the police and threats from the Ku Klux Klan, they were unable to organize the Black communities in Madison County.\nIn 1964, Dennis and Moses’ plan for the Freedom Summer came to life. Dennis brought in white Northerners to bring national attention to the movement, as he knew that white injuries or deaths would bring more media attention. However, during that summer, a tragedy occurred as three of the Freedom Summer volunteers were killed by the Ku Klux Klan. Dennis was impacted greatly by these deaths because he had worked with the volunteers that were killed, and he was originally supposed to be with them, but was not with them because he had bronchitis. Dennis felt at fault for their deaths, stating \"I feel very responsible for Chaney and them...you never get over that. I guess I will live with it until the day I die.\" Dennis gave an impassioned eulogy at James Chaney's funeral, part of which was recreated in the film Mississippi Burning.\nThe deaths of Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwerner, and Chaney left Dennis cynical and skeptical of the methods and the cost of the Southern Freedom movement.\n\nAfter the Civil Rights movement\nAfter Dennis disconnected himself from Mississippi, he went to the University of Michigan Law School, received a Juris Doctor degree, and eventually opened a legal practice in Lafayette, Louisiana. In 1989, At a reunion for the anniversary of the Freedom Summer, Dennis reconnected with Bob Moses, and learned of his project to teach algebra to sixth graders in inner-city schools, which interested Dennis. Moses and Dennis wanted to expand the program into the Black public schools of the Mississippi Delta. They expanded the Algebra Project into Mississippi as well as Louisiana, Kentucky, and Arkansas. As of 2014, Dennis maintained the position of director and CEO of the Southern Initiative of the Algebra Project \nDennis's son, David Dennis Jr., conducted in-depth interviews with his father, supplemented with extensive collateral research, which he edited into a first-person memoir of Dennis's years in The Movement. Interspersed with letters from Dennis, Jr. to his father, the book reflects on that experience, including the phenomenon of \"survivors' guilt,\" as well as the impact on their father-son relationship. Published in 2022, the book is titled The Movement Made Us. Dennis Jr. is the winner of the 2021 American Mosaic Journalism Prize.\n\nOther activism\nCo-organizer of a challenge to the Mississippi Democratic Party at the 1964 Democratic National Convention and also to the Louisiana Democratic Party at 1972 Democratic National Convention.\nCo-Organizer of numerous sit-ins and demonstrations in New Orleans, Shreveport, and Baton Rouge in Louisiana and in Hattiesburg, Clarksdale, Canton, and Jackson in Mississippi.\nEstablished the first African American cooperative in the south, the Ruleville Mississippi Quilting Cooperative, which was formed of 18 women from that town.\n\nOrganizations\nCo-director of Council of Federated Organizations (COFO)\nMississippi director of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE)\nOne of the coordinators of the Mississippi Freedom Summer\n\nExternal links\nSNCC Digital Gateway: Dave Dennis, Documentary website created by the SNCC Legacy Project and Duke University, telling the story of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee & grassroots organizing from the inside-out\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "The Bluesky Formation is a stratigraphic unit of Lower Cretaceous age in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin. It takes the name from the hamlet of Bluesky, and was first described in Shell's Bluesky No. 1 well by Badgley in 1952.\n\nLithology and Depositional Environment\nThe formation is composed of mudstones, conglomerates and sandstones which can be quartzose or contain chert grains.  Many of the Bluesky sandstones do not display bedding features although some low and moderate-angle large scale cross-bedding has been observed in some sections. The sediments were deposited in both marginally marine nearshore and fully marine offshore settings following a transgression of the ancient Moosebar Sea. Bluesky sediments are separated from Gething strata by a scoured or loaded contact and occasionally by a burrowed Glossifungites surface. The Bluesky Formation can be very porous and produces hydrocarbons in many areas across Western Canada. Heavy oil is produced from the Bluesky formation in the Peace River area.\n\nDistribution\nThe Bluesky Formation reaches a thickness of 46 meters (151 ft) in the Pouce Coupe area, and thins out toward north and west. Thin sands can be found in the Peace River area.\n\nRelationship with other units\nAlthough some early workers included the Bluesky Formation in the Bullhead Group, it is usually classified as the basal unit of the Fort St. John Group. It is conformably overlain by the Wilrich Member of the Spirit River Formation and conformably underlain by the Gething Formation. Northeast of the town of Peace River it was deposited unconformably on Mississippian limestone. It is equivalent with the Glauconitic Sandstone of the Mannville Group in central and southern Alberta, as well as with the Wabiskaw Member of the Clearwater Formation in the eastern part of northern Alberta.\n\nBitumen Deposits\nThe Bluesky deposit of bitumen comes from the \"clean estuarine reservoir sands of the Cretaceous-age Bluesky Formation\" in the Peace River. Secondary production area is the Gething Formation. The combined Bluesky-Gething deposit is the primary target area for oil sands development in the Peace River area. There is a reservoir at about 600 m (2,000 ft)–700 m (2,300 ft) below the surface. Heavy oil in the Peace River, produced from bitumen deposit is extracted using wells not by mining.\n\nThe oil sands of the Bluesky-Gething were deposited during the Cretaceous Period within a transgressive system, with the lower fluvial to nonmarine Gething Formation at the base and the estuarine Bluesky Formation at the top. Deposition of the Bluesky-Gething reservoir and nonreservoir units was controlled by topography of the pre-Cretaceous unconformity. The Red Earth Highlands separate the Bluesky-Gething into northeast and southwest accumulations and includes part of the Seal Lake area. In the Peace River oil sands areas, the Bluesky-Gething is overlain by the marine shales of the Wilrich Member.\n\n\n== References ==",

It is found tropical moist lowland forest up to 1,000 meters above sea level. It is declining due to habitat loss.\n\nDescription and taxonomy\nIt is 23 centimetres (9.1 in) long. The black bill is slender and curved and the tail is fairly long and slightly forked. The plumage is mostly glossy blue-black apart from a white bar on the underwing and white marks on the thigh feathers and on the underside of the tail. Young birds are duller than the adults but otherwise similar unlike young Square-tailed drongo-cuckoo which are spotted white. The call is a repeated series of 8 or 9 ascending notes.\nIt belongs to the genus Surniculus along with the Square-tailed drongo-cuckoo (S. lugubris). The two were previously classified as a single species but are now often separated based on differences in calls and juvenile plumage.\n\nSubspecies\nTwo subspecies are recognized:\n\nS. v. velutinus   – Found on  Mindanao, Samar, Leyte, Bohol and the Mindanao\nS. v. chalybaeus – Found on Luzon, Panay and Negros.\nS. v. suluensis    – Found on Sulu Archipelago\n\nEcology and behavior\nIt inhabits the canopy and middle storey of lowland forest where it feeds on insects. . It is usually shy and solitary.\nNothing is known about its breeding habits, nest and fledgeling.\n\nHabitat and conservation status\nIts natural habitats at tropical moist lowland primary forest, secondary forest and bamboo woodland up to 1,000 meters above sea level.\nThe IUCN has classified the species as being of Least Concern where it is said to be locally common. However, the population is believed to be declining due to deforestation from land conversion, Illegal logging and slash-and-burn farming.\nOccurs in a many protected areas in Bataan National Park, Bulusan Volcano Natural Park, Angat Watershed Forest Reserve, Northern Sierra Madre Natural Park on Luzon, Pasonanca Natural Park, Mount Kitanglad, Mount Apo on Mindanao and Rajah Sikatuna Protected Landscape in Bohol and Samar Island Natural Park in Samar.

    "title": "Sepulana",
    "text": "Sepulana (also sePulane) is the language of the Mapulana people, a low-veld ethnic group primarily located in the Bushbuckridge area, which spans the northeastern Mpumalanga and southeastern Limpopo provinces of South Africa. The language is spoken by an estimated 800,000 people. \nSepulana is classified within the Bantu language family, specifically as part of the Sotho-Tswana group, and is considered an Eastern Sotho language, alongside Pai and Kutswe. Historically, Sepulana has been incorrectly regarded as a dialect of Northern Sotho (Sesotho sa Leboa) or Sepedi, a perception stemming from its geographical proximity to the Bapedi people, despite clear linguistic distinctions. This historical miscategorisation has implications for its current status. Sepulana exists predominantly in an unwritten form and is not formally taught in schools. Despite its non-official status, significant community-led efforts are underway for its documentation, revitalisation, and official recognition.\n\nLinguistic classification\nSepulana's linguistic classification places it firmly within the broader Bantu language family. It belongs to the Sotho-Tswana group, which corresponds to the S.30 label in Guthrie's 1967–71 classification of Bantu languages. This group encompasses closely related languages such as Setswana, Northern Sotho, Southern Sotho, and Lozi.\nWithin the Sotho-Tswana group, linguists classify Sepulana as part of the Eastern Sotho varieties, alongside Pai and Kutswe. These Eastern Sotho varieties are often considered more divergent from the core Northern Sotho dialects. Maho (2002) notably left the \"East Sotho\" varieties of Kutswe, Pai, and Pulana unclassified within Sotho-Tswana, further emphasizing their distinctiveness from other Sotho-Tswana languages.\nA significant aspect of Sepulana's linguistic identity is its distinction from Northern Sotho and Sepedi. While it shares some similarities with Sepedi (Northern Sotho), Sepulana is explicitly stated not to be a dialect of Sepedi (Sesotho Sa Leboa). Northern Sotho functions as an umbrella term for a collection of related dialects, with Sepedi being the specific dialect spoken by the Pedi people. The written form of Northern Sotho was largely based on the Sepedi dialect, developed by missionaries in 1860. This historical standardisation process led to \"Sepedi\" being used as a broader term for the entire language family, even though it is technically just one dialect. \nThe historical classification of Sepulana as a mere dialect, particularly during the apartheid era, was a political decision rather than a purely linguistic one, contributing to ongoing debates about its status. This historical imposition has fueled the Mapulana people's ongoing efforts to gain recognition for their language as a sovereign official tongue. The Pan South African Language Board (PanSALB) conducted a survey in 2017 to address the controversy surrounding the names Sepedi and Sesotho sa Leboa, finding that a majority of respondents preferred Sesotho sa Leboa, indicating a broader dissatisfaction with the imposed Sepedi label. This situation underscores the complex interplay between linguistic classification, historical power dynamics, and cultural identity in South Africa.\n\nGeographic distribution and demographics\nSepulana is primarily spoken in the Bushbuckridge area, a low-veld region situated near the border of Mpumalanga and Limpopo provinces in South Africa. This area is also known as Mapulaneng, a name that holds deep cultural significance as it directly translates from the Sepulana language to mean \"Place of the Mapulana people\". This direct linguistic link between the place name \"Mapulaneng\" and the \"Mapulana people\" and their language \"Sepulana\" signifies a profound, inherent connection between the community, their ancestral land, and their linguistic identity. The town of Bushbuckridge itself originated around a trading store established in 1884 and was named for the abundant bushbuck herds and a prominent ridge in the 1880s.   \nThe Mapulana people are a distinct ethnic group, and their language, Sepulana, is a central component of their cultural identity. The estimated number of native Sepulana speakers is approximately 800,000. The Bushbuckridge Local Municipality serves as the administrative center for this region, which is home to a significant population of Mapulana speakers. The substantial number of speakers, coupled with the language's non-official status, highlights a notable discrepancy in formal recognition for this linguistic community.\n\nCurrent status and influences\nSepulana currently exists predominantly in an unwritten form and is not taught in schools. This unwritten status is a consequence of its historical marginalisation, particularly during the apartheid era when it was classified as a mere dialect rather than a distinct language.\nDue to its geographical location and the socio-economic interactions of its speakers, Sepulana has been influenced by several other languages. These influences include neighboring indigenous languages such as Swati and Xitsonga (Tsonga). The oral history of the Mapulana people also recounts historical conflicts with Swazis and Shangaans, indicating long-standing interactions that would naturally lead to linguistic exchange. More dominant South African languages, including English and Afrikaans, have also exerted influence. Furthermore, other Sotho-Tswana languages like Sepedi, Setswana, and Southern Sotho (Sesotho) have made inroads into Sepulana. Children in the region often acquire English, Afrikaans, and Sepedi at school, while migrant workers returning home introduce words and phrases from Setswana, Sesotho, and Afrikaans.    \nDespite these influences and the pervasive presence of other languages, Sepulana has retained its unique vocabulary and linguistic features, distinguishing it from other Sotho languages. However, the absence of a standardized written form and formal education, coupled with the pervasive influence of other languages and the active discouragement of Sepulana in educational settings, collectively pose a significant threat to the language's vitality. Studies indicate that the use of Sepulana by first-language speakers can negatively impact their learning of Sepedi, the standardised language taught in schools. Subject advisors have actively discouraged the use of Sepulana in classrooms, asserting that only Sepedi, as the official language, should be used, and often dismissing Sepulana as \"not a language but a dialect\". This perspective has been criticized for its bias and for disregarding the principle that all language varieties can be promoted and developed. Within the Mapulana community, some sub-dialects, such as HiPaye (spoken by the Mambayi subgroup), are facing extinction, with very few speakers remaining. This decline reflects the broader challenges to language transmission and survival.\n\nOrthography and phonology\nCurrently, Sepulana exists primarily in an unwritten form, meaning there is no widely adopted or standardized writing system for the language. The existing written form for Northern Sotho, with which Sepulana is sometimes erroneously associated, was standardized using the Latin alphabet. This orthography was developed by missionaries in 1860, largely based on the Sepedi dialect, and employs specific conventions for sounds, such as 'š' for the [ʃ] sound and circumflex accents to distinguish certain vowel sounds.\nIn response to the need for a more linguistically efficient writing system for highly agglutinative Southern African languages, including Eastern Sotho languages like Sepulana that currently lack standardized Latin orthographies, a new ideographic writing system called Ditema tsa Dinoko has been developed. The emergence of Ditema tsa Dinoko, an ideographic writing system specifically designed for Eastern Sotho languages such as Sepulana, represents a proactive, community-aligned initiative to address the historical absence of a written form for these languages. This system aims to remedy the \"slowness in reading\" often associated with the numerous multigraphs used in Latin scripts for these languages. Ditema tsa Dinoko is characterized as a syllabary, where individual graphemes representing consonants, vowels, and featural elements are combined into syllabic blocks known as amabheqe. The positioning of consonant graphemes within this system often corresponds to their place of articulation (e.g., labials at the apex, alveolars across the middle). It also incorporates specific markers for articulatory mode, such as Uphimbo (a voicing line), Lerothodi (a glottal action dot), and Ingungwana (a nasalization marker).  \nLike other Bantu languages, Sepulana is expected to exhibit agglutinative morphology, meaning it uses numerous affixes and derivational/inflectional rules to construct complete words. Bantu languages typically feature complex noun class and concord systems. Northern Sotho, for instance, is a non-articled language. Academic studies on the core vocabulary and morphological structures, such as compound words, in Sepedi provide insights into the grammatical characteristics shared across related Sotho-Tswana languages.\n\nDocumentation and revitalization efforts\nSignificant community-led initiatives and partnerships are actively engaged in documenting, preserving, and promoting the Sepulana language, aiming to counteract its historical marginalization.\nA pivotal organization in these efforts is the Mapulaneng Writers' Association (MWA). The MWA serves as an advocacy and lobby group dedicated to Mapulana culture, history, and language. In a notable step towards establishing a written literary tradition for Sepulana, the MWA introduced and launched six newly published novels written in the language in 2019. Members of the MWA, including prominent language activist Gakwi Mashego, have also contributed to the language's written presence by publishing newspaper articles in Sepulana. Mashego is a vocal advocate for the recognition of all indigenous languages in South Africa.    \nAnother key initiative is the Sepulana Bible Translation Project, a collaborative endeavor involving Wycliffe SA, the Church of the Nazarene, and the Mapulaneng Writers' Association. This project's primary goal is the oral Bible translation and transcription of the New Testament into Sepulana. Phase 1 of the project successfully completed the oral Bible translation of 40 narratives from both the Old and New Testaments, as well as an oral and written translation of the Gospel of Mark. The team is currently in Phase 2, focusing on the translation of the Gospel of Matthew. The project receives support from various sources, including funding from organizations like Johannesburg Waste Management Company. Community members, such as Itireleng Florence Chiloane, a retired teacher and curriculum implementer, play an active role as reviewers, demonstrating the strong local commitment to the project.\nThe Mapulana community has been actively lobbying for Sepulana to be recognized as an official language of Mpumalanga province. A significant achievement in these efforts occurred in 2018 when a government entity agreed to use Sepulana in official signage, providing formal visibility for the language. This struggle for recognition is part of a broader movement across South Africa, where various indigenous nations, including the Balobedu and AmaHlubi, are seeking official recognition for their languages.\nCommunity engagement is a vital component of these revitalization efforts. Song-writing workshops have been organised with the Mapulana community to create worship songs based on the translated scriptures, thereby integrating the language with cultural and religious practices. These initiatives align with broader language preservation strategies that emphasize community-based programs, cultural events, and the integration of traditional knowledge with language learning. The multi-faceted approach to Sepulana revitalisation, encompassing literary publications, religious translations, and political lobbying, demonstrates a comprehensive and strategic community-led effort to secure the language's future and counteract historical marginalisation. The ultimate aim is to empower indigenous communities to lead their own revitalisation efforts, potentially leveraging technological advancements such as app development to teach younger generations.\n\nCultural context of the Mapulana people\nThe Sepulana language is inextricably linked to the rich cultural heritage and history of the Mapulana people. The Mapulana (or Pulana) are a low-veld ethnic group whose name is believed to be derived from their founding leader, Lepulana, who later adopted the name Chiloane. Their historical origins can be traced back to the Kgalagadi, from where they settled in Thaba Chueu, in what is now eastern Lesotho, and Shakwaneng (Carolina) during the 1500s.\nResearch indicates that the Mapulana people comprise three main ancestral groups: the Mapulana of Mohlomi, who are of Bakwena origin; the Mapulana of Matshwe I, of Pulane, who are of Amazizi (Nguni) origin and previously resided along the Tugela River before joining other Mapulana at Thaba Chueu; and the Mapulana of Chiloane, who are of Barolong (Setswana) origin and separated from the main Barolong tribe during the reign of Tau. This diverse ancestry suggests a complex historical tapestry and potential linguistic influences from various Sotho-Tswana and Nguni groups. Historically, the Mapulana of Chiloane inhabited Phageng (Empakeni) and the Lepunama River area (Nelspruit), while the Mapulana of Mashego lived at Motsheteng (Emjindini, Barberton).\nThe Mapulana people maintain distinct traditional beliefs and practices that are deeply intertwined with their language. Like most Sotho-Tswana groups, they venerate Badimo (ancestors). Ancestral acknowledgement ceremonies, known as go phasa badimo, involve facing east towards Shakwaneng, pouring traditional beer and animal blood on a sacrificial platform (legandelo), and ritually calling out the names of ancestors according to hierarchy. The Mmalo (Coral) tree is commonly planted on these sacrificial platforms.\nTraditional medicine is a recognised specialty among the Mapulana, a practice facilitated by the abundance of medicinal herbs in the subtropical climate of Mapulaneng. Traditional doctors, or Dingaka, undergo rigorous and lengthy training under a Gobela (Guru), with trainees referred to as letwasane (Sangoma). Rainmaking was also a notable specialty of the Mapulana, with the tribe's name itself possibly linked to their rain-making capabilities or the Lepunama (White) River.\nThe Mapulana also practice initiation rites for their youth, marking the transition into womanhood and manhood. These initiation schools (koma) are held during the winter months. Boys who undergo initiation together form a mphato or moroto (regiment), with an elaborate system in place to distinguish regiments based on their initiation year. The rich tapestry of Mapulana cultural practices and their diverse ancestral origins clearly demonstrate that Sepulana is not merely a linguistic code but a fundamental, living component of a complex cultural heritage. The vitality of Sepulana is directly linked to the continuity of these cultural practices, as the language serves as the primary vehicle for transmitting oral histories, performing rituals, teaching traditional medicine, and conducting initiation ceremonies. Its preservation is therefore crucial for the continuity of Mapulana identity and the unique knowledge systems embedded within their traditions.   \nThe Mapulana share borders and have had historical interactions with several neighboring tribes, including the AmaSwazi to the south, the Mahlanganu/Tsongas to the east, the Bapedi baSekhukhune and Bakone to the west, and the Banareng and Batokwa to the north. Oral histories also recount past conflicts with the Swazis and Shangaans.\n\nSee also\nMapulana people\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "Guan Zhong",
    "text": "Guan Zhong (Chinese: 管仲; Wade–Giles: Kuan Chung; c. 720–645 BC) was a Chinese philosopher and politician. He served as chancellor and was a reformer of the State of Qi during the Spring and Autumn period of Chinese history. His given name was Yiwu (Chinese: 夷吾; pinyin: Yíwú). Zhong was his courtesy name. He is mainly remembered for his reforms as chancellor under Duke Huan of Qi, as well as his friendship with his colleague Bao Shuya, though his reputation remained controversial among the Confucians, as detailed in the  appraisal section.\nThrough Guan Zhong's reforms and skilful diplomacy Qi became the most powerful of the feudal states and Duke Huan became the first of the Five Hegemons. Though knowledge of his reforms is limited, in particular he instituted a famous fiscal policy known as \"balancing the light and the heavy\", associated with salt and iron monopolies. Otherwise a diverse work, the Guanzi compilation making use of his name makes similar such recommendations.\n\nLife\nYouth and friendship with Bao Shuya\nGuan Zhong, a descendant of either Shu Xian of Guan or King Mu of Zhou, was born in Yingshang, and became acquainted with Bao Shuya at an early age, when they became business partners. The Shiji records that, as partner, Guan Zhong often took more than his share of the profits, in effect cheating Bao Shuya. Bao, however, recognised his impoverished background and was not offended.\n\nTutors of different princes\nSubsequently, Guan Zhong was appointed tutor to Prince Jiu, the younger brother of the ruling Duke Xiang of Qi. Bao Shuya, meanwhile, became tutor to Jiu's younger brother, Prince Xiaobai.\nIn 686 BC, Duke Xiang was murdered in a palace coup by two of his ministers, who then installed Gongsun Wuzhi, a scion of the ducal house, as the new Duke. Recognising that they were in mortal danger, both Prince Jiu and Prince Xiaobai fled with their respective tutors. Prince Jiu fled to the State of Lu, while Prince Xiaobai went to the State of Ju.\n\nBecoming chancellor\nIn 685 BC, Gongsun Wuzhi himself was killed in another palace coup, and the ministers of Qi sent envoys to Ju, hoping to receive Prince Xiaobai back and succeed to the duchy. On hearing of this, Lu also sent Prince Jiu towards Qi, while Guan Zhong intercepted Prince Xiaobai to prevent his return. In the resulting conflict, Guan Zhong shot an arrow at Xiaobai which hit his belt buckle. Xiaobai pretended to cough blood and collapse, tricking Guan Zhong into thinking he was mortally wounded.\nEventually, Xiaobai won the race back to Qi, and was installed as Duke. The State of Lu attempted to enforce Prince Jiu's claim, but was defeated in battle, after which Qi forced Lu to execute Prince Jiu and send Guan Zhong back as a prisoner. Xiaobai originally wanted to execute Guan Zhong as well, but Bao Shuya strongly recommended sparing him and elevating him to chancellor, even though that meant he would outrank Bao himself. Xiaobai was eventually convinced.\n\nDomestic reforms\nDuke Huan had inherited a state in turmoil, after three years of civil wars and usurpation had severely depleted the treasury. As Chancellor, Guan Zhong instituted extensive reforms aimed at organising and strengthening the Qi state.\nAdministratively, the capital was divided into 21 districts: six of merchants, which provided the Qi state's trade revenue, and fifteen of attendants, which provided the core of the Qi army. Similarly, the population outside the capital was organised: 30 households were formed into one village, 10 villages as one troop, 10 troops as one district, 3 districts as one county, and counties grouped into five regions. Administrators were appointed at every level, with the regional administrators reporting on their jurisdictions to the Duke every year.\nEconomically, Guan Zhong disbanded the well-field system instituted since the Zhou dynasty; instead, all land was to be taxed according to its productivity. At the same time, Qi's coastal position was exploited through the expansion of fisheries and salt production, while trade was encouraged through certain privileges. For instance, people bearing goods to market on foot, and carriages arriving empty at markets to make purchases, were not subject to tolls; this encouraged the use of the state-managed markets.\nGuan Zhong wrote that because taxation would reduce the people's wealth and make them dislike the government, it was better to obtain revenue by monopolizing the sale of salt, iron, forest products, and ore. Thus, these \"goods of the mountains and seas\" (namely iron and salt) should be state managed. Similarly, a price-regulation scheme existed for food, with granaries buying grain in bounty years to be released into the market in lean years. Finally, coinage was also unified to encourage trade within Qi.\n\nAppraisal\nGuan Zhong would ultimately be identified with the Legalist school as a result of his administrative reforms. Though actually legalistic philosophy did not develop until hundreds of years later, R. Eno of Indiana University does consider that \"If one were to trace the origins of Legalism as far back as possible, it might be appropriate to date its beginnings to the prime ministership of Guan Zhong, chief aide to the first of the hegemonic lords of the Spring Autumn period, Duke Huan of Qi (r. 685–643).\"\nHe is said to have indulged in a luxurious lifestyle, and did not equate a ruler's moral purity with his ability to govern. Duke Huan, who loved hunting and women, asked Guan if these indulgences would harm his hegemony, to which Guan replied that the ruler's love for luxury would not harm his hegemony. It would only be harmed through inappropriate staffing and misuse of talent. One passage \"recounts\" Confucius as considering him \"mediocre\" for his lack of frugality and knowledge of ritual.\nDespite all this, he might be considered, \"at least in most respects\" an \"ideal Confucian minister\". Guan Zhong is reported to have advised Duke Huan: 'Summon the wavering with courtesy and cherish the remote with virtuous conduct. So long as your virtuous conduct and courtesy never falter, there will be no one who does not cherish you.'\" When Duke Huan was approached to dethrone the ruling clans of his state, Guan Zhong advised him that he had won their adherence through politeness (li) and trustworthiness (xin).\nWhen Confucius's students criticized Guan Zhong as lacking propriety, crediting his ambition and achievement Confucius said of him that \"It was due to Guan Zhong that Duke Huan was able to assemble the feudal lords on numerous occasions without resorting to the use of his war chariots. Such was his goodness! ... Through having Guan Zhong as his minister Duke Huan became protector over the feudal lords. He brought unity and order to the entire realm so that even today people enjoy his gifts to them ... I am afraid that without Guan Zhong we would be folding our lapels right-over-left (traditional Chinese clothing customarily is folded left-over-right).\" \nThe students of Confucius also posted a question whether Guan Zhong followed Ren (Confucian humaneness) or not. However, in pre-Qin period, \"Ren\" has a distinctive utilitarian definition. Hence, from this standpoint, Guan Zhong followed \"Ren\".\n\nAchievements\nGuan Zhong started multiple reforms in the State of Qi. Politically, he centralized power and divided the state into different villages, each carrying out a specific trade. Instead of relying on the traditional aristocracy for manpower, he applied levies to the village units directly. He also developed a better method for choosing talent to be governors. Under Guan Zhong, Qi shifted administrative responsibility from hereditary aristocrats to professional bureaucrats. He is also credited for creating the first official government sponsored brothel known as \"女市\" which funded the government treasury.\nDuring his term of office, the State of Qi became much stronger. The Zuo Zhuan records that in 660 BC, Guan Zhong urged Duke Huan of Qi to attack the small neighboring State of Xing which was under attack from Quan Rong nomads, a non-Chinese Rong tribes. Later, in 652 BC he advised the duke not to ally with a vassal ruler's son who wished to depose his father. Duke Huan often listened to Guan Zhong's sound advice such that his status amongst other Zhou vassal states rose. As a result, the duke came to be recognized as the first Hegemon or leader of the vassal alliance.\nIn recognition of Guan Zhong's service, Duke Huan gave him the honorary title of \"Godfather\" (仲父). The same title was later given to Lü Buwei by Prince Zheng, the future Qin Shi Huang.\n\nState Monopoly on Salt and Iron\nUnder Guan's guidance several important economic reforms were introduced. He created a uniform tax code and also used state power to encourage the production of salt and iron.\nHe believed that monopolizing the nature resources was helpful on improving the government income, with fewer complaints from the public than raising taxes. The strategy was described by himself to the Duke of Huan as \"managing the mountain and the sea（官山海)\", which mainly refers to iron mine from the mountain and salt from the sea. Under his policy, private business who produce salt by boiling seawater and iron by mining must sell all outputs to the government, and the government resell refined salt and iron products, with huge price gap, to all household in State of Qi.\nHistorians usually credit Guan Zhong for introducing state monopolies controlling salt and iron.\n\nQi-Hengshan War\nIn the record of Guanzi Chapter 84, Duke of Huan wanted to restrain the threat from State of Hengshan (衡山国) and asked Guan for solution. State of Hengshan was famous for its weapon production. Guan then ordered officials to buy arms from State of Hengshan in large quantities. After ten months, worrying that the price will continuously grow up, State of Yan, State of Dai and later State of Qin followed up the buying. The price then jumped sharply and, as a result, almost all household in State of Hengshan switched to make weapons instead of farming. One year later, Guan ordered officials to buy rice from State of Zhao, at a price more than three times higher than normal. By seeing the potential huge profit, State of Hengshan sold its rice inventory to officials from State of Qi. Afterwards, Guan suddenly ordered State of Qi's army to invade State of Hengshan. With selling out of weapon and rice, State of Hengshan soon surrendered.\nSome historians marked Qi-Hengshan War the early form of Economic Warfare.\n\nPublications\nHe composed the Guanzi encyclopedia, officially compiled by the Jixia Academy during the Warring States period.\n\nIn popular culture\nGuan Zhong is one of 32 historical personages featured in the Koei game Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI, where he is referred to as Guan Yiwu.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nWorks by Zhong Guan at Project Gutenberg\nWorks by or about Guan Zhong at the Internet Archive\n\"Master Guan\".

    "text": "Karl Szilárd was a Hungarian-Soviet mathematician. He made contributions to differential equations, complex analysis, and aerodynamics.\n\nEarly life and education\nSzilárd was born in 1901 in Győr, the younger brother of Stefánia Szilárd. (The siblings were not related to the physicist Leo Szilard, as is written in some sources).\nHe studied at Jena and Göttingen. After getting the doctorate degree at Göttingen in 1927 under Richard Courant, he worked in industry.\n\nMove to Russia and imprisonment\nA member of the German communist party, in 1934 he emigrated to Russia, following his sister and her husband, the biologist Ervin Bauer, who had emigrated a decade earlier. He worked in the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI) in Moscow.\nArrested in 1938, he worked in the \"sharashka\" on the construction of military aircraft. His cellmates included his friend, the famous Russian physicist Yuri Rumer (being released earlier than Rumer, Szilárd helped him to smuggle his scientific writings out of the prison), and the famous aircraft designers Andrei Tupolev and Robert Bartini. According to memoirs of the times, \"Karlusha\", as he was affectionately called by his colleagues/cellmates, was loved by virtually everybody, including the prison guards.\n\nRelease and rehabilitation\nHe was released in 1948, receiving the Stalin Prize around the same time for his fundamental work on ballistics. After his release, Szilárd again worked for TsAGI and for Referativnyi Zhurnal \"Matematika\" (a Russian analog of Zentralblatt and Mathematical Reviews, currently defunct). He was formally rehabilitated in 1956.\n\nReturn to Hungary\nIn 1960 he returned to Hungary, resumed his work in mathematics, and headed the Department of Differential Equations of the Institute of Mathematics at Budapest. He facilitated contacts of his former \"sharashka\" cellmates from the Tupolev construction bureau with the Hungarian airline company.\n\nDeath\nSzilárd died in 1980.\n\nReferences\n\nAs of [[Special:Permalink/{{{revision}}}|this edit]], this article uses content from \"Mathematicians Going East\", authored by Pasha Zusmanovich, which is licensed in a way that permits reuse under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License, but not under the GFDL.

    "title": "Indoor bonsai",
    "text": "Indoor bonsai are bonsai cultivated for the indoor environment. Traditionally, bonsai are temperate climate trees grown outdoors in containers. Tropical and sub-tropical tree species can be cultivated to grow and thrive indoors, with some suited to bonsai aesthetics shaped as traditional outdoor or wild bonsai.\nBonsai and related practices, like penjing, hòn non bộ, and saikei, involve the long-term cultivation of small trees and landscapes in containers. The term bonsai is generally used in English as an umbrella term for all miniature trees in containers or pots.\n\nIndoor vs. traditional bonsai\nIndoor bonsai is the cultivation of an attractive, healthy plant in the artificial environment of indoors rather than using an outdoor climate, as may occur in traditional bonsai. Indoor penjing is the cultivation of miniature landscapes in a pot or tray, possibly with rocks, bonsai trees, and ground covers, and sometimes with small objects or figurines.\n\nBonsai vs. other forms of house plant\nCompared to the usual potted house plant, bonsai are rooted in a much smaller amount of soil. Consequently, they require more frequent watering and feeding. This form is therefore best suited for drought-resistant species. Compared to usual house gardening, bonsais require a lot more pruning, both of branches and roots.\n\nCultivation and care\nMany of the techniques used to grow and shape outdoor bonsai apply equally to indoor bonsai. For example, shaping techniques like pruning, wiring, and grafting work much the same for both types of bonsai. But indoor bonsai also have some special requirements for cultivation and care.\n\nLighting\nAn indoor room comfortably lit for human use provides too little light for most species of tree to grow. Few species will thrive with less than 500 lux available several hours per day. Successful indoor bonsai cultivation requires either selecting from the short list of low-light-tolerant trees, or providing additional lighting for the trees. Insufficient light may not kill some species outright, but will make their growth so slow that the bonsai shaping techniques cannot be used: the plant will not grow back after pruning or leaf trimming.\nThe simplest way to provide extra light is to place the bonsai close to an outside window. Care is taken not to harm the plant either with cold air entering through the window, or with high radiated heat from direct exposure to the sun. More controllable light, and more flexibility in situating the bonsai, can be obtained using artificial lighting. Fluorescent lighting (preferably with bulbs radiating growth-friendly spectra) and light-emitting diode lighting can give sufficient light to support a significant number of indoor bonsai species. These lights also have the advantage of blending with other indoor lighting, so that the plants can be grown in normal living quarters. For plants needing the highest amount of light, or for large numbers of bonsai being maintained indoors, a space dedicated to bonsai cultivation can support high-intensity lamps and optionally the special ventilation or cooling often needed for their use.\n\nTemperature\nSuitable temperatures for indoor bonsai extend from standard room temperature downward. The best temperature range for a tree is determined by its species and, less directly, by its normal range in the wild. Tropical trees are usually tolerant of room temperature year-round but cannot tolerate temperatures approaching freezing, as might occur near an open window in cold weather. Semi-tropical and Mediterranean-climate trees often grow better when temperatures drop well below room temperature during winter months. The lower temperature, combined with shorter periods of daylight, triggers an expected annual dormancy which many non-tropical species need in order to thrive. These non-tropical trees need a cool location in the winter, such as a cool window ledge or \"cold room\" area in the house. In addition to the need for seasonal temperature variation, many non-tropicals grow better when there is a distinct difference between day temperatures (warm) and night (cooler).\n\nHumidity\nIndoor conditions, particularly in homes outside the tropics, imply very low humidity. Both air conditioning and room heating reduce air humidity significantly. Some tree species, such as ficus sp. with their waxy leaves, are tolerant of low humidity. Many species, however, require additional humidification to survive indoors. As with lighting, some humidification solutions can be integrated into the regular living area and some require a dedicated space. Local humidity can be raised by locating the bonsai containers over a tray of water, or by placing them in a bed of dampened sand. For better effect, the bonsai can be placed in enclosures, such as terrariums, that are humidified from within. For the maximum humidity, a dedicated room with high-capacity evaporative or misting humidifiers can support the most sensitive bonsai.\n\nPlants suitable for indoor bonsai\nTropical\nThe creation of bonsai is limited only by the imagination and talent of the gardener, although some species are much more suitable than others. Members of the genus Ficus are among the most versatile, while many succulents can be grown in a similar fashion. Here is an incomplete list of the most popular species.\n\nCrassula ovata: The jade plant is a very robust and drought-resistant house plant. The miniature cultivars like the baby jade plant (C. ovata arborescens) is considered the best plant for a first bonsai. This plant will sprout on old wood. Thus, an old specimen can be pruned back to a stockier shape with thick trunk. It is kept dry in winter, placed outdoors in summer for full growth. Its roots are thin and cannot be exposed.\nCycas revoluta: This plant is often used as an indoor bonsai. Though it does not have a traditional tree shape, it can give an image of a tropical island.\nDracaena marginata: The dragon plant has an interesting palm-like shape. It can sprout on old wood. It does not tolerate root exposure.\nFicus benjamina: The Weeping Fig is a popular indoor tree that lends itself to the classical, upright form. It is one of the few tropicals that are accepted as \"true\" bonsai. The miniature cultivars like 'Too Little' are also well suited for bonsai. It forms aerial roots and can be shaped as a banyan tree. Ficus are intolerant to branch down-pruning; one must start with a small tree and keep it small. They are sensitive to stress.\nFicus salicaria: According to Jerry Meislik, \"the most useful fig for bonsai is the willow leafed fig. The small leaf is in excellent scale for bonsai and the tree has good branch ramification, good basal rootage and excellent aerial root formation.\"\nPortulacaria afra: The dwarf jade looks a lot like a baby jade plant and is used similarly.\n\nHeptapleurum arboricola: The Hawaiian umbrella tree is a popular, hardy houseplant that is ideal for irregular, banyan or roots-on-rock forms. Since it can sprout on old wood, an old specimen can be pruned back to a stockier shape with thick trunk and roots. It tolerates root exposure very well, is drought-resistant and requires a moderate amount of light. Under high humidity conditions, it produces aerial roots and can therefore be shaped as a banyan tree.\nSchlumbergera: The Christmas cactus does not have a real trunk but easily lends itself to a cascade-type bonsai shape. It tolerates shade, not drought.\nTamarindus indica The tamarind has recently become popular in bonsai culture, frequently used in Asian countries like Indonesia, Taiwan and the Philippines. In the last Japan Airlines World Bonsai competition, Mr. Budi Sulistyo of Indonesia won the second prize with an ancient tamarind bonsai.\nSmall succulents may be used as accent plants:\n\nHatiora salicornoides\n\nOther climatic origins\nWith proper care, a number of non-tropical plants can also thrive as indoor bonsai.\n\nAraucaria heterophylla: The Norfolk Pine is a needle-bearing evergreen. It does well indoors and is often seen in commercial buildings, but is not easily shaped to bonsai styles.\nArdisia crenata: The spear-flower will flower and produce berry-like fruit when grown indoors.\nBougainvillea: Native to South America, this flowering shrub, will grow indoors with sufficient light.\nBucida molineti: The black olive is native to southern Florida in the US, and has a compact growth habit suited to bonsai forms.\nBoxwood: Found on nearly every continent, boxwood varieties are tough but attractive bonsai. The varieties Buxus harlandii and Buxus microphylla (Kingsville boxwood) have tiny leaves and develop mature-looking bark, supporting bonsai aesthetics.\nCalliandra haematocephala (Red powderpuff): The Calliandra family includes evergreen bushes growing in tropical and subtropical areas worldwide. The haematocephala species has small needle-like leaves and unusual-looking feathery blossom that appear in spring and summer.\nCamellia japonica (Common camellia), Camellia sinensis: In the mountains of Japan and Korea, trees of the Camellia family grow up to 10 to 12 meters high. Camellia sinensis in particular suit bonsai treatment, with relatively small leaves and flowers.\nCarmona microphylla: The sturdy trunk and glossy green leaves of the Fukien Tea make an attractive indoor bonsai. Tiny white flowers appear regularly, and a characteristically rough or gnarled bark gives an appearance of age on even young bonsai.\nCasuarina equisetifolia (Horsetail tree): The horsetail tree grows up to 25 meters in the wild, but can be cultivated indoors as a compact bonsai. Its foliage is needle-like although the plant is considered a deciduous tree, and it can be shaped to resemble a spruce or pine.\nCitrus japonica 'Hindsii' (Kumquat): This fruiting tree is one of the kumquat varieties, and relatives with small leaves suitable for indoor bonsai include Citrus japonica 'Margarita', Citrus japonica 'Japonica' (Marumi kumquat), × Citrofortunella mitis, Citrus aurantifolia (Key lime), and Citrofortunella microcarpa (Calamondin). The trees flower and may even bear fruit in pot cultivation.\nCupressus macrocarpa: The Monterey Cypress is one of the few evergreen conifers that can be grown indoors. Trunk thickness is difficult to develop, but the fine juniper-like foliage suits even small bonsai.\nFeroniella lucida: Native to southeast Asia, this tree flowers and produces edible fruit. It is a slow grower in a container, but small leaves and a rough trunk make it very suitable for bonsai.\nFraxinus uhdei (Tropical ash): Though the leaf clusters do not match common bonsai aesthetics, this tree can be shaped into an effective bonsai, particularly as the trunk ages and develops character.\nLigustrum sp.: Some privet species, including Ligustrum japonica and Ligustrum rotundifolium, are suitable subjects for indoor bonsai.\n\nSerissa: This is a delicate flowering plant with tiny leaves that can grow indoors year round.\nSyzygium paniculatum, syn. Eugenia paniculata: A flowering and fruiting evergreen tree with slender leaves, this native of Australia grows to 6 meters in the wild. As a bonsai, it can be shaped in most styles suiting deciduous trees.\nUlmus parvifolia: The Chinese elm is often used as outdoor bonsai, and it can be raised indoors as well.\n\nSee also\nBonsai aesthetics\nBonsai styles\nHouseplant\n\n\n== References ==",

Little is known of his life beyond the texts which are attributed to him (A biographical notice De vita, aetate ac scripsis Johannis Dastin is found in a 17th-century manuscript: Ms Oxford, Bold. Libr., Ashmol. 1445, VIII, fol. 53). Dastin is known for correspondence with Pope John XXII and Cardinal Napoleone Orsini in defense of alchemical practice, dated to 1320.\nWork attributed to Dastin was included in the 1625 Harmoniae imperscrutabilis Chymico-Philosophicae of Hermannus Condeesyanus, the 1629 Fasciculus Chemicus of Arthur Dee, and the 1652 Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum of Elias Ashmole.\nRecent research has revealed that John Dastin lived around 1293–1386. He was born in the village of Greet, in the county of Gloucestershire and was ordained deacon in 1311. He studied at Oxford and was appointed vicar of the church of Bringhurst, Leicestershire. In mid-1317 he traveled to Avignon to work in the service of Cardinal Napoleon Orsini (†1342) and obtained the benefits of a canonry of the collegiate church of Southwell. During his stay in Avignon he was known as \"magister Johannes Anglicus.\" He worked at the court of Napoleon Orsini, and he helped Giovanni Gaetano Orsini during his legacy in Italy (1326–1334). Dastin returned to Oxford in 1341 and was appointed vicar of the Church of Aberford, in Yorkshire, associated with Oriel College. He died at an earlier date than 1386.\n\nWorks\nLetter to John XXII\nDastin argues that artificial transmutation into gold with the help of sulphur of mercury (argent vive) is equivalent to natural transformation. Furthermore, that \"art imitates nature, and in certain respects corrects and surpasses it just as infirm nature is changed by the industry of medicine.\"\n\nRosarius\nThe Rosarius Philosophorum, also known by its incipit Desiderabile desiderium (the desired desire). The Rosarium is known in manuscript and was printed in 1702 by Jean-Jacques Manget in his Bibliotheca Chemica Curiosa.\nIt was also attributed to Dastin's contemporary Arnaldus de Villa Nova (1238–1311 or 1313) and translated into French under the title La Vraie Pratique de la noble science d'alchimie. Later still it was attributed to Nicolas Flamel under the title The Book of Washing.\n\nVisio\nIn manuscripts, this text was often associated with the Visio Edwardi. It was printed for the first time in 1625 under the title Visio Ioannis Dastin.\nAn English translation, Dastin's Dream appeared in Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum of Elias Ashmole, published 1652.

    "title": "Essence of Decision",
    "text": "Essence of Decision: Explaining the Cuban Missile Crisis is book by political scientist Graham T. Allison analyzing the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Allison used the crisis as a case study for future studies into governmental decision-making. The book became the founding study of the John F. Kennedy School of Government, and in doing so revolutionized the field of international relations.\nAllison originally published the book in 1971. In 1999, because of new materials available (including tape recordings of the U.S. government's proceedings), he rewrote the book with Philip Zelikow.\nThe title is based on a speech by John F. Kennedy, in which he said, \"The essence of ultimate decision remains impenetrable to the observer - often, indeed, to the decider himself.\"\n\nThesis\nWhen he first wrote the book, Allison contended that political science and the study of international relations were saturated with rational expectations theories inherited from the field of economics. Under such a view, the actions of states are analyzed by assuming that nations consider all options and act rationally to maximize their utility.\nAllison attributes such viewpoints to the dominance of economists such as Milton Friedman, statesmen such as Robert McNamara and Henry Kissinger, disciplines such as game theory, and organizations such as the RAND Corporation. However, as he puts it:\n\nIt must be noted, however, that an imaginative analyst can construct an account of value-maximizing choice for any action or set of actions performed by a government.\nOr, to put it bluntly, this approach (which Allison terms the \"Rational Actor Model\") violates the principle of falsifiability. Also, Allison notes that \"rational\" analysts must ignore a lot of facts in order to make their analysis fit their models.\nIn response, Allison constructed three different ways (or \"lenses\") through which analysts can examine events: the \"Rational Actor\" model, the \"Organizational Behavior\" model, and the \"Governmental Politics\" model.\nTo illustrate the models, Allison poses the following three questions in each section:\n\nWhy did the Soviet Union decide to place offensive missiles in Cuba?\nWhy did the United States respond to the missile deployment with a blockade?\nWhy did the Soviet Union withdraw the missiles?\n\nModels\nThe \"Rational Actor\" Model\nThe origin of Allison's first model is explained above. Basically, under this theory:\n\nGovernments are treated as the primary actor.\nThe government examines a set of goals, evaluates them according to their utility, then picks the one that has the highest \"payoff.\"\nUnder this theory, Allison explains the crisis like this:\n\nJohn F. Kennedy, in 1961, revealed that the Soviet Union, despite rhetoric, had far fewer ICBMs than it claimed. In response, Nikita Khrushchev ordered nuclear missiles with shorter ranges installed in Cuba. In one move, the Soviets bridged the \"missile gap\" while scoring points in the Cold War. Based on Kennedy's failure to back up the Bay of Pigs Invasion, they believed the U.S. wouldn't respond harshly.\nKennedy and his advisors (EXCOMM) evaluated a number of options, ranging from doing nothing to a full invasion of Cuba. A blockade of Cuba was chosen because it wouldn't necessarily escalate into war, and because it forced the Soviets to make the next move.\nBecause of mutually assured destruction by a nuclear war, the Soviets had no choice but to bow to U.S. demands and remove the weapons.\nAllison guessed that Kennedy must have made an \"under the table\" agreement concerning American nuclear missiles in Turkey. The American tapes released following 1993 confirmed this and the missiles were quietly removed from Turkey a few years after the crisis.\n\nThe \"Organizational Process\" Model\nAllison noted there were many facts that the rational model had to ignore, such as why the Soviets failed to camouflage the nuclear sites during construction, but did so only after U-2 flights pinpointed their locations.\nHe cited work by James G. March and Herbert A. Simon, which argue that existing governmental bureaucracy places limits on a nation's actions, and often dictates the outcome. He then proposed the following \"organizational process\" model propositions:\n\nWhen faced with a crisis, government leaders don't look at it as a whole, but break it down and assign it according to pre-established organizational lines.\nBecause of time and resource limitations, rather than evaluating all possible courses of action to see which one is most likely to work, leaders settle on the first proposal that adequately addresses the issue, which Simon termed \"satisficing.\"\nLeaders gravitate towards solutions that limit short-term uncertainty (emphasis on \"short-term\").\nOrganizations follow set \"repertoires\" and procedures when taking actions.\nBecause of the large resources and time required to fully plan and mobilize actions within a large organization (or government), leaders are effectively limited to pre-existing plans.\nUnder this theory, the crisis is explained thus:\n\nBecause the Soviets never established nuclear missile bases outside of their country at the time, they assigned the tasks to established departments, which in turn followed their own set procedures. However, their procedures were not adapted to Cuban conditions, and as a result, mistakes were made that allowed the U.S. to quite easily learn of the program's existence. Such mistakes included such gaffes as supposedly undercover Soviet troops decorating their barracks with Red Army Stars viewable from above. Alternatively, the secrecy may have been the gaffe, stoking American fears unnecessarily.\nKennedy and his advisors never really considered any other options besides a blockade or air strikes, and initially, were almost unanimously in favor of the air strikes. However, such attacks created massive uncertainty because the U.S. Air Force couldn't guarantee it would disable all the nuclear missiles. Additionally, although Kennedy wanted a \"surgical\" air strike that would destroy the missiles without inflicting extensive damage, the existing Air Force plan required extensive bombing that would have created more collateral damage than Kennedy desired. Because the U.S. Navy already had considerable strength in the field, because there was a pre-existing plan in place for a blockade, and because Kennedy was able to communicate directly with the fleet's captains, members fell back on the blockade as the only safe option.\nThe Soviets simply did not have a plan to follow if the U.S. took decisive action against their missiles. Khrushchev's communications indicated a high degree of desperation. Without any back-up plan, the Soviets had to withdraw.\n\nThe \"Bureaucratic Politics\" Model\nAfter reading works by Richard Neustadt and Samuel P. Huntington, among others, Allison proposed a third model, which takes account of court politics (or palace politics). While statesmen don't like to admit they play politics to get things done, especially in high-stakes situations such as the Cuban missile crisis, they nonetheless do.\nAllison proposed the following propositions for this model:\n\nA nation's actions are best understood as the result of politicking and negotiation by its top leaders.\nEven if they share a goal, leaders differ in how to achieve it because of such factors as personal interests and background.\nEven if a leader holds absolute power (e.g., the President of the United States is technically the commander-in-chief), the leader must gain a consensus with his underlings or risk having his order misunderstood or, in some cases, ignored.\nRelated to the above proposition, the make-up of a leader's entourage will have a large effect on the final decision (i.e., an entourage of \"yes men\" will create a different outcome than a group of advisors who are willing to voice disagreement).\nLeaders have different levels of power based on charisma, personality, skills of persuasion, and personal ties to decision-makers.\nIf a leader is certain enough, they will not seek input from their advisors, but rather, approval. Likewise, if a leader has already implicitly decided on a particular course of action, an advisor wishing to have influence must work within the framework of the decision the leader has already made.\nIf a leader fails to reach a consensus with his inner circle (or, at least, the appearance of a consensus), opponents may take advantage of these disagreements. Therefore, effective leaders must create a consensus.\nBecause of the possibilities of miscommunication, misunderstandings, and downright disagreements, different leaders may take actions that the group as a whole would not approve of.\nAllison had to admit that, because the Soviets were not as open with their internal affairs as the Americans, he simply didn't have enough data to fully interpret the crisis with this model. Nonetheless, he made the following attempt:\n\nKhrushchev came under increasing fire from the Presidium because of Kennedy's revelation of the Soviet lack of ICBMs, as well as American successes in the Berlin Airlift. Also, the Soviet economy was being stretched, and military leaders were unhappy with Khrushchev's decision to cut the size of the Red Army. Placing missiles in Cuba was a cheap and quick way for him to secure his political base.\nBecause of the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion, Republicans in the Congress made Cuban policy into a major issue for the upcoming congressional elections later in 1962. Therefore, Kennedy immediately decided on a strong response rather than a diplomatic one. Although a majority of EXCOMM initially favored air strikes, those closest to the president - such as his brother and Attorney General, Robert F. Kennedy, and special counsel Theodore Sorensen - favored the blockade. At the same time, Kennedy got into arguments with proponents of the air strikes, such as Air Force General Curtis LeMay. After the Bay of Pigs Invasion fiasco, Kennedy also distrusted the CIA and its advice. In order to avoid appearing weak to the hawkish members of EXCOMM, Kennedy rejected the purely diplomatic proposals of United States Ambassador to the United Nations Adlai Stevenson. This combination of push and pull led to a consensus for the implication of a blockade.\nWith his plans thwarted, Khrushchev tried to save face by pointing to American missiles in Turkey, a position similar to the Cuban missiles. While Kennedy refused to move these missiles \"under duress,\" he allowed Robert Kennedy to reach a deal with Soviet ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin, in which the Turkish missiles would be quietly removed several months later. Publicly, Kennedy also agreed never to invade Cuba.\n\nImplications\nWhen the book was first published, Allison's primary message was that the concept of mutually assured destruction as a barrier to nuclear war was unfounded. By looking at organizational and political models, such an outcome was quite possible - nations, against what was predicted by the rational viewpoint, could indeed \"commit suicide.\"\nHe pointed to several incidents in history that seemed to back this assertion. His most salient point: prior to the attack at Pearl Harbor, Japanese military and civilian leaders, including those responsible for making the decision, were fully aware that they lacked the industrial capacity and military might to win a war against the U.S. They went ahead and attacked anyway.\nHe also believed that the organizational model explained otherwise inexplicable gaffes in military history. To return to 1941, he noted that the U.S. intercepted enough evidence to indicate that Japan was about to attack Pearl Harbor, yet the commander did not prepare. The answer, Allison revealed, was not some conspiracy, but that what the intelligence community viewed as a \"threat of attack,\" the commander interpreted as a \"threat of sabotage.\" This miscommunication, due to different viewpoints, allowed the attack to be pulled off successfully - as Allison sarcastically noted, having U.S. planes lined up wing-to-wing and surrounded by armed guards was a good plan for preventing sabotage, but not for surviving an aerial attack.\nLikewise, the political process model explained otherwise confusing affairs. Allison pointed to the decision by General Douglas MacArthur to defy his orders during the Korean War and march too far north. The reason was not a \"rational\" change in U.S. intentions, but rather, MacArthur's disagreements with Harry Truman and other policymakers, and how officials allowed MacArthur to make what they considered unwise moves because of concerns over political backlash due to the general's public popularity.\nAbove all, he described using rational actor models as dangerous. By using such models (and modes of thinking), people made unreliable assumptions about reality, which could have disastrous consequences. Part of what allowed the attack on Pearl Harbor to be pulled off was the assumption that, since Japan would lose such a war, they would never dare attack. The assumption under MAD is that nobody will ever start a nuclear war because of its consequences. However, humans are not inextricably bound to act in a rational manner, which history has proven time and time again.\nWhile Allison did not claim that any of his additional two models could fully explain anything, he noted that policymakers and analysts alike would benefit from stepping away from the traditional model and exploring alternate viewpoints (although this last remark could be viewed as facetious on Allison's part).\n\nCriticism\nThe book is part of an ongoing argument between supporters of rational expectations theories and analysts who look for alternative explanations.\nMoreover, Allison pointed out that the \"rational actor\" model continues to be applied even in long-term analyses (i.e., analyses that take place long after the event or \"crisis\" is past). In Essence of Decision, Allison suggests that one reason for the popularity of rational actor models is that, compared to other models, they require relatively little data and provide researchers with an \"inexpensive approximation\" of the situation. Allison also quotes Thomas Schelling's description of rationalistic thinking and vicarious problem solving:\n\nYou can sit in your armchair and try to predict how people will behave by asking how you would behave if you had your wits around you. You get, free of charge, a lot of vicarious, empirical behavior.\nFinally, in Allison's first edition (1971), he was unable to fully explore his theories because much of the information was still classified. As a result, he made a number of assumptions on his own part. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the release of American recordings of EXCOMM, this new information (included in the revised 1999 edition) sometimes agreed with Allison's assumptions, but sometimes didn't.\nFor example, in 1971, Allison guessed that Kennedy must have made an \"under the table\" agreement concerning the Turkish missiles, probably using his brother as a liaison. The American tapes confirmed this.\nHowever, Allison also guessed in 1971 that Khrushchev must have formed his own \"EXCOMM,\" or his own committee of advisors, to aid him during the crisis, and even named the Russian leaders he believed were with Khrushchev at the time. However, the Soviet records revealed that these individuals were not present, and Khrushchev was effectively stuck alone in his office during the crisis without the type of support Kennedy had.\n\nReferences\nAllison, Graham (1971).

    "text": "Vila Flor (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈvilɐ ˈfloɾ] ) is a municipality in Portugal. Locally referred to as the Portuguese Capital of Olive Oil, Vila Flor is located in the Terra Quente Transmontana, in the southern part of the district of Bragança. The population in 2011 was 6,697, in an area of 265.81 square kilometres (102.63 mi2).\n\nHistory\nIt was King Denis who, while travelling through the burg (then known as Póvoa d´Álem Sabor, became enchanted by the local landscape and, in 1286, renamed the district Vila Flor. Around 1295, the King ordered the construction of a walled city, consisting of five gates, to protect the fledgling settlement and guard Portuguese interests in the territory.\nDuring the Middle Ages, this bouquet of flowers, as Cabral Adão (1910, in Vila Flor - 1992, in Almada), Vila Flor-born stomatology doctor and writer, once called it, became the home to many fleeing Jewish families, who settled in the territory to start farms and businesses of small industry (such as tanneries and jewelers). King Manuel eventually conferred on the settlement an official charter (foral), later to be reformulated in May 1512. Having favorable, tolerant views towards Portuguese Jews until he decided to marry Infanta Isabella of Aragon, Manuel I agreed to persecute the Jews of Portugal because the anti-Semite parents of his fiancée wouldn't approve that policy. King Manuel expelled the Jews from the municipality, whose remaining peoples or the army were then responsible for destroying the homes of the expelled Jews.\n\nGeography\nAdministratively, the municipality is divided into 14 civil parishes (freguesias):\n\nClimate\nVila Flor has a Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers and cold, wet winters.\n\nEconomy\nRich in history, tradition, monuments and citizenry, the municipality is also an important reference for agriculture, owing to the fertility of the Vilariça Valley (Vale da Vilariça). Olive oil and chestnut are among its main agricultural productions. Companies, such as Frize (a Sumol + Compal sparkling water brand) and Sousacamp (edible mushroom producer), known within and outside of Portugal, are located in within its municipal borders. The growth of tourism has meant that lodgings have developed throughout the region. Hotels and homestays, as well as establishments catering to rural- and agro-tourism, are found in the municipality. This tourist offer includes available options ranging from seasonal treks in the region to the municipal camping site and river beaches.\n\nNotable citizens\nJoaquim Trigo de Negreiros (born 1900), lawyer and official of the civil registry, president of the administrative council of Vila Flor, before moving to Porto, becoming assistance Attorney of Portugal, Civil Governor of Porto, Subsecretary of State for Corporations and Social Security, and the Secretary of State for Social Security, in addition to providing public security forces with new equipment. For eight years he was minister of the Domestic Affairs, closed Tarrafal in 1954, and as member of the Parliament in various  legislatures, he was responsible for implementing the modern public health system: he originated the Hospital Escolar de Santa Maria and the Hospital of São João (in Porto), he was also responsible for the growth in nursing instruction (in 1947). He was a founder of the Diário Popular.\nArtur Guilherme Trigo Vaz (born 1919), doctor, municipal councillor (1951–54 and 1964–68), president of the municipal council (1970–74), responsible for Peneireiro Dam, and president/founder of the Sport Clube de Vila Flor; Vaz also dedicated himself to the history of Vila Flor, publishing the O Passado e o Presente, in December 1949.\nRaul de Sá Correia (May 1900 - 8 December 1993), municipal secretary (1934), responsible for the construction of the library, museum and archive. On his retirement he was named honorary citizen of the municipality and attributed a commemorative medal marking the 7th centenary of Vila Flor; a year later President Mário Soares honored him with Order of Henry the Navigator; and on his death a bronze bust was erected in front of his former home, and a hall in the museum dedicated to him.\nJúlia D'Almendra (1904 –1992), musicologist, pedagogue, organist and violinist.\nFrancisco Maria Guerra (1876 - 1962), lawyer and administrator of the municipality of Miranda do Douro; conservator of the district land registry and president of the municipality of Vila Flor (1933-1946), he was responsible for a series of public works including the construction of several primary schools, bridges, cemeteries, warehouses, fountains, the opening of many municipal roads, squares and avenues, including Avenida Marechal Carmona. He was honored with the Military Order of Christ, and in 1962 (following his death), a bronze statue was erected in his honor.\nFrench-Portuguese vocalist Lucenzo (born 1983) traces his origins to Vila Flor, homeland of his parents.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nDiscover Vila Flor",

    "text": "Acacia havilandiorum, also known as Haviland's wattle or needle wattle, is a shrub of the genus Acacia and the subgenus Plurinerves. It is native to areas in South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria.\n\nDescription\nThe bushy shrub or small typically grows to a height of 1.5 to 4 metres (5 to 13 ft) and has glabrous and terete branchlets. Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. The grey to green, inclined to ascending and straight or slightly incurved, rigid phyllodes are 3 to 9 cm (1.2 to 3.5 in) in length and 0.8 to 1.5 mm (0.031 to 0.059 in) wide and are quite brittle and tend to break easily. It blooms between July and October producing simple inflorescences which occur in group of one to three in the axils and have spherical flower-heads with a diameter of 3 to 7.5 mm (0.12 to 0.30 in) and contain 20 to 30 bright yellow coloured flowers. Following flowering it produces glabrous and firmly papery seed pods which are straight to curved and raised over each seed and slightly constricted between them and have a length of 3 to 9 cm (1.2 to 3.5 in) and a width of 2 to 3 mm (0.079 to 0.118 in).\n\nTaxonomy\nThe species was first described by Joseph Maiden in 1920 as Acacia havilandi, despite the specific epithet honouring both Edwin Haviland and his son, who \" specialised in the fertilisation of Australian plants and (have) also worked at taxonomy and other branches of botany\" The epithet was changed to a genitive plural  (havilandiorum) to accord with ICN Art. 60.8 (Shenzhen Code, 2018).\n\nDistribution\nThe plant has a scattered and discontinuous distribution from as far west as the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia where it is common, to  further north in the Flinders Range through to Griffith and Cobar but the range extends as far as Gilgandra in the east. It is only known around Horsham in the north west region of Victoria. In New South Wales the plant is mostly found in the Pilliga Scrub between Gilgandra and Milgee as a part of mallee and box woodland communities.\n\nSee also\nList of Acacia species\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "Stacie Orrico",
    "text": "Stacie Joy Orrico (born March 3, 1986) is an American singer and songwriter. After signing to ForeFront Records, Orrico recorded her first album, Genuine (2000). Her second studio album Stacie Orrico (2003), released by ForeFront and Virgin, debuted at No. 59 on the Billboard 200, and was certified gold with over 500,000 sales in the United States. The first single \"Stuck\" reached No. 52 on Billboard Hot 100, and achieved greater success worldwide. Her second single \"(There's Gotta Be) More to Life\" peaked at No. 30 on the Billboard Hot 100. \nHer self-titled album has achieved sales worldwide of over 3.5 million. In 2003, she made her first television appearance as an actress in two episodes of American Dreams. Her third album, Beautiful Awakening (2006) spawned two singles, \"I'm Not Missing You\" and \"So Simple\".\n\nEarly life\nOrrico was born in Seattle, Washington, to Patti (née Schmautz) and Dean Orrico, who were missionaries. She is of one-quarter Italian descent, born to a close-knit family. The family later moved to Denver, Colorado, where Orrico took piano lessons from Cathy Paquette. Orrico is the middle child of five: her siblings are Jesse, Rachel, Alicia, and Joshua. She was a missionary with her family and lived in Ukraine for several years.\nOrrico grew up influenced by a wide range of musical styles and was a member in the church choir; she often accompanied on the piano as the family sang Christian hymns. At age six, Orrico wrote her first song, entitled \"Always Answer\". She also attended missionary school with singer Allen Stone.\n\nCareer\n1999–2001: Early work and debut album\nOrrico got her start at the age of 13, by attending a Christian music festival, Praise in the Rockies, held in her then-home state of Colorado. Orrico inadvertently entered a high-stakes talent competition, and won. A ForeFront Records executive was on hand and approached her for a record deal. She later signed with them. In 2001, she toured with Destiny's Child as their opening act on select dates of their Survivor tour in the United States.\nShe went on to release two albums. The first was Genuine (2000), which she recorded at age 14. It sold over 13,000 copies in the first week, the highest debut-week sales ever for a female Christian artist. The album produced the hit single \"Don't Look At Me\", which topped Christian charts for ten consecutive weeks. The album had two No. 1 hits, as well as three more top-ten singles. Genuine eventually sold 500,000 copies, giving the album a Gold certification on word of mouth alone.\nIn 2001, 15-year-old Orrico released her only Christmas album, Christmas Wish. The six tracks on the EP were: \"Christmas Wish\", \"Love Came Down\", \"O Holy Night\", \"What Child is This\", \"O Come All Ye Faithful\", and \"White Christmas\".\n\n2002–2004: International success with Stacie Orrico\nHer next effort, the more mainstream self-titled album Stacie Orrico, was released in 2003 and charted on the US Billboard 200 (debuting at No. 67), Australian ARIA Albums Chart and the UK Albums Chart. The first mainstream single from this album was \"Stuck\", which became a worldwide hit, reaching the Top 5 on the majority of the world's charts. This was followed by the single \"(There's Gotta Be) More to Life\", which peaked in the top 20 in Australia (No. 11) and the UK (No. 12), although, overall, \"Stuck\" charted better, the exception being in the US. In 2014, English singer Sam Smith mentioned in an interview that \"(There's Gotta Be) More to Life\" is their favorite music video.\nIn December 2003, Orrico performed Christmas music such as \"The Christmas Song\" on NBC's news and talk show Today. She also performed \"Stuck\" on UK and Italy's Total Request Live. In 2003, she portrayed Peggy Santiglia of the girl group the Angels in an episode of NBC's drama television series American Dreams. In the show, she performed the Angels' song \"My Boyfriend's Back,\" which was included on the show's soundtrack.\nThis was then followed by \"I Promise\", written by Diane Warren (top 30 in the UK), and the final mainstream single \"I Could Be the One\" (top 40 in the UK in June 2004). Both singles were given limited releases and limited promotion, meaning they did not fare as well as the first two singles. The last three singles were only released to Christian radio in addition to \"Strong Enough\", which reached No. 1 as the CD's very first single. Stacie Orrico sold over 500,000 copies in the US, enough sales for a Gold certification. The album also sold 600,000 in Japan and an estimated 3.4 million copies worldwide. In 2004, Orrico's songs \"(There's Gotta Be) More to Life\" and \"Stuck\" appeared on the Barbie Hit Mix.\nShe was nominated at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards in the category Best Pop/Contemporary Gospel Album, but the award was given to Michael W. Smith.\nIn March 2004, she took a break for a couple of years.\n\n2005–2007: Beautiful Awakening\nShe was dropped by her label ForeFront Records in 2005 after seven years. After her break, she decided to work on her new album, called Beautiful Awakening, which was set to be released worldwide on August 29, 2006; however, for reasons unknown, the release of the album was postponed in the US. In an interview, she said that the album was one of the best albums she has worked on and was a personal album; the songs are about her life and more. Though almost all of the songs from the new album leaked onto the internet, Beautiful Awakening was still released in Japan, the UK, and other countries. The album features production from Dallas Austin, Dwayne Bastiany, KayGee, and The Underdogs, and writing duties are performed by notable songwriters like She'kspere, Track & Field, Anthony Dent, Nate Butler and newcomer Novel and Orrico herself. The album sold 100,000 copies in Japan.\nThe first single, \"I'm Not Missing You\", went for radio adds on June 20, 2006, but due to little promotion was re-released in October. The song peaked at No. 19 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart. The second single from the album, \"So Simple\", was released in Asia in October 2006 and was released in Europe on January 27, 2007. The album release in the US and Canada was canceled and Orrico has no sign of an official US release. \"Beautiful Awakening\" is available to purchase on iTunes.\nIn 2007, the belated release of Beautiful Awakening was postponed once again. In March, Orrico announced that Virgin Records was merging with Capitol Records and she had left them and would not be releasing the album with that label. Her record company terminated her contract and her tour dates were canceled. On her Myspace it was announced that she would spend time in Africa.\n\n2008–2011: Hiatus\nAfter a long break from the public eye, Orrico headlined the QB Goes Live concert on March 15, 2008, in Cambodia, performing to an audience of over 50,000 at the Phnom Penh Olympic Stadium. Orrico also appeared at Singfest Festival in Singapore. She also held a short Japan tour in July 2008 in Tokyo, Osaka and Fukuoka. Orrico collaborated with producer and songwriter Toby Gad and Onree Gill in 2008.\nIn 2009, she was back in the studio with Brandon Beal and Cannon Mapp to record her upcoming fourth album. One of the tracks she recorded was \"Light Years\". Later the song did not make the album and was re-recorded by Albanian-American artist Kristine Elezaj in 2010.\nIn 2010, she co-wrote a song with Novel for American Idol winner and R&B singer Fantasia Barrino called \"I Can't Be Without You\" for her third studio album Back to Me. Unfortunately the song did not make the final album. Rumor had it that Orrico would retire from the music business, but her long-time collaborator Novel confirmed in 2010 that Orrico is still writing music and in 2011, her friend Rachael Lampa also confirmed Orrico's musical return.\n\n2012–present: Comeback, \"The Return\" concert\nIn 2012, she featured on The Fray's third studio album Scars and Stories on the track \"Ready or Not\", which is a cover of The Fugees song. The song is only available on the deluxe edition bonus disc of the album. She independently released a new song called \"Catch Me If You Can\" on April 2, 2012. \"Catch Me If You Can\" is composed and performed by Orrico and The Gabe Cummins Orchestra, which has a jazzy sound. A release date for a new album was never confirmed.\nOrrico posted a video on her YouTube account in 2013 to explain her hiatus and announce plans to return to the studio. Orrico revealed she had been studying women's literature and acting at New York University from 2011 to 2013. She announced that she was working on an R&B album, slated to be released in 2014 (as of 2022 this had not been released). She worked with several collaborators, including producers Allen Stone, Hal Linton, Gabe Cummins and The Lions.\nTo celebrate her comeback, she performed a virtual concert on November 6, 2013, via Stageit.com.\nOn November 9, 2015, Orrico performed with the house band at the time, Jon Batiste and Stay Human on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\n\nInfluences\nWhen asked about her influences, she responded: \"All of my influences are very soulful musicians – my favorite artist is Lauryn Hill, and I've always loved Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey and Ella Fitzgerald – and I wanted to explore that direction more.\" She said when she was young, she listened to Alicia Keys, Monica and Destiny's Child.\nHer other musical influences include Christina Aguilera, Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan and Toni Braxton.\n\nPersonal life\nIn March 2007, Orrico traveled to South Africa as a volunteer with Cross-Cultural Solutions to help children with HIV/AIDS.\nAfter several years of dating, Orrico married actor Isaiah Johnson in July 2016. As of 2022, Orrico and Johnson have a son and a daughter.\nOrrico was one of the founders of The Nile Project, \"a modern day artist’s salon\" focused on providing women \"a place for collaborative, feminine ways of healing and creating.\"\nIn January 2026, Orrico filed a lawsuit against her former manager Britt Ham along with Universal Music Group, ForeFront Records and others, for alleged sexual battery, childhood sexual abuse, negligence, and gender violence.\n\nDiscography\nGenuine (2000)\nStacie Orrico (2003)\nBeautiful Awakening (2006)\n\nFilmography\nAwards\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nStacie Orrico at AllMusic \nStacie Orrico at IMDb",

    "title": "Class (set theory)",
    "text": "In set theory and its applications throughout mathematics, a class is a collection of mathematical objects (often sets) that can be unambiguously defined by a property that all its members share. Classes act as a way to have set-like collections while differing from sets so as to avoid paradoxes, especially Russell's paradox (see § Paradoxes). The precise definition of \"class\" depends on foundational context. In work on Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, the notion of class is informal, whereas other set theories, such as von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory, axiomatize the notion of \"proper class\", e.g., as entities that are not members of another entity.\nA class that is not a set (informally in Zermelo–Fraenkel) is called a proper class, and a class that is a set is sometimes called a small class. For instance, the class of all ordinal numbers, and the class of all sets, are proper classes in many formal systems.\nIn Quine's set-theoretical writing, the phrase \"ultimate class\" is often used instead of the phrase \"proper class\" emphasising that in the systems he considers, certain classes cannot be members, and are thus the final term in any membership chain to which they belong.\nOutside set theory, the word \"class\" is sometimes used synonymously with \"set\". This usage dates from a historical period when classes and sets were not distinguished as they are in modern set-theoretic terminology. Many discussions of \"classes\" in the 19th century and earlier are really referring to sets, or rather perhaps take place without considering that certain classes can fail to be sets.\n\nExamples\nThe collection of all algebraic structures of a given type will usually be a proper class. Examples include the class of all groups, the class of all vector spaces, and many others. In category theory, a category whose collection of objects forms a proper class (or whose collection of morphisms forms a proper class) is called a large category.\nThe surreal numbers are a proper class of objects that have the properties of a field.\nWithin set theory, many collections of sets turn out to be proper classes. Examples include the class of all sets (the universal class), the class of all ordinal numbers, and the class of all cardinal numbers.\nOne way to prove that a class is proper is to place it in bijection with the class of all ordinal numbers. This method is used, for example, in the proof that there is no free complete lattice on three or more generators.\n\nParadoxes\nThe paradoxes of naive set theory can be explained in terms of the inconsistent tacit assumption that \"all classes are sets\". With a rigorous foundation, these paradoxes instead suggest proofs that certain classes are proper (i.e., that they are not sets). For example, Russell's paradox suggests a proof that the class of all sets which do not contain themselves is proper, and the Burali-Forti paradox suggests that the class of all ordinal numbers is proper. The paradoxes do not arise with classes because there is no notion of classes containing classes. Otherwise, one could, for example, define a class of all classes that do not contain themselves, which would lead to a Russell paradox for classes.  A conglomerate, on the other hand, can have proper classes as members.\n\nClasses in formal set theories\nZF set theory does not formalize the notion of classes, so each formula with classes must be reduced syntactically to a formula without classes.  For example, one can reduce the formula \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        =\n        {\n        x\n        ∣\n        x\n        =\n        x\n        }\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A=\\{x\\mid x=x\\}}\n  \n to \n  \n    \n      \n        ∀\n        x\n        (\n        x\n        ∈\n        A\n        ↔\n        x\n        =\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\forall x(x\\in A\\leftrightarrow x=x)}\n  \n. For a class \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A}\n  \n and a set variable symbol \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n, it is necessary to be able to expand each of the formulas \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        ∈\n        A\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x\\in A}\n  \n, \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        =\n        A\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x=A}\n  \n, \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        ∈\n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A\\in x}\n  \n, and \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        =\n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A=x}\n  \n into a formula without an occurrence of a class.p. 339\nSemantically, in a metalanguage, the classes can be described as equivalence classes of logical formulas: If \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            A\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {A}}}\n  \n is a structure interpreting ZF, then the object language \"class-builder expression\" \n  \n    \n      \n        {\n        x\n        ∣\n        ϕ\n        }\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\{x\\mid \\phi \\}}\n  \n is interpreted in \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            A\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {A}}}\n  \n by the collection of all the elements from the domain of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            A\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {A}}}\n  \n on which \n  \n    \n      \n        ϕ\n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\phi (x)}\n  \n holds; thus, the class can be described as the set of all predicates equivalent to \n  \n    \n      \n        ϕ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\phi }\n  \n (which includes \n  \n    \n      \n        ϕ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\phi }\n  \n itself). In particular, one can identify the \"class of all sets\" with the set of all predicates equivalent to \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        =\n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x=x}\n  \n.\nBecause classes do not have any formal status in the theory of ZF, the axioms of ZF do not immediately apply to classes. However, if an inaccessible cardinal \n  \n    \n      \n        κ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\kappa }\n  \n is assumed, then the sets of smaller rank form a model of ZF (a Grothendieck universe), and its subsets can be thought of as \"classes\".\nIn ZF, the concept of a function can also be generalised to classes. A class function is not a function in the usual sense, since it is not a set; it is rather a formula \n  \n    \n      \n        Φ\n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Phi (x,y)}\n  \n with the property that for any set \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n there is no more than one set \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y}\n  \n such that the pair \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x,y)}\n  \n satisfies \n  \n    \n      \n        Φ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Phi }\n  \n. For example, the class function mapping each set to its powerset may be expressed as the formula \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n        =\n        \n          \n            P\n          \n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y={\\mathcal {P}}(x)}\n  \n. The fact that the ordered pair \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x,y)}\n  \n satisfies \n  \n    \n      \n        Φ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Phi }\n  \n may be expressed with the shorthand notation \n  \n    \n      \n        Φ\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Phi (x)=y}\n  \n.\nAnother approach is taken by the von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel axioms (NBG); classes are the basic objects in this theory, and a set is then defined to be a class that is an element of some other class. However, the class existence axioms of NBG are restricted so that they only quantify over sets, rather than over all classes. This causes NBG to be a conservative extension of ZFC.\nMorse–Kelley set theory admits proper classes as basic objects, like NBG, but also allows quantification over all proper classes in its class existence axioms. This causes Morse–Kelley set theory to be strictly stronger than both NBG and ZFC.\nOther set theories, such as New Foundations or the theory of semisets, still give rise to \"proper classes\" (insofar as they require classes that are not sets), because they do not postulate that all subclasses of a set are themselves sets. For example, any set theory with a universal set must include proper classes that are subclasses of sets.\n\nNotes\nReferences\nJech, Thomas (2003), Set Theory, Springer Monographs in Mathematics (third millennium ed.), Berlin, New York: Springer-Verlag, ISBN 978-3-540-44085-7\nLevy, A.

    "title": "Sjöbo Municipality",
    "text": "Sjöbo Municipality (Swedish: Sjöbo kommun) is a municipality in Skåne County in southern Sweden. Its seat is located in the town Sjöbo.\nThe present municipality was created in 1974 when the former market town (köping) Sjöbo was amalgamated with the surrounding rural municipalities. There are fifteen original entities within today's municipality.\n\nGeography\nThe town of Sjöbo has flat terrain, with many small houses and three long straight streets stretching through it, leading to larger roads.\nThe northwestern part of the municipality includes the main part of Vombsjön, the largest lake of southern Scania and notable for being the water source of Malmö. Some parts of the lake belong to Lund Municipality. It offers fishing for European perch, pike, pikeperch and eel.\n\nLocalities\nThere are 9 urban areas (also called a Tätort or locality) in Sjöbo Municipality.\nIn the table they are listed according to the size of the population as of December 31, 2005. The municipal seat is in bold characters.\n\nActivities\nThere are at least five (largely) authentic medieval churches from the 12th century in the municipality (in Södra Åsum, Tolånga, Björka, Blentarp and Everlöv). They are notable for not having undergone the severe restorations that many other churches in Scania suffered once the population began growing in the second half of the 19th century and Helgo Zetterwall was hired to expand on them.\nFrescos which adorned the apse of Södra Åsum church and the ceilings of the churches in Everlöv and Illstrop centuries ago have been slowly uncovered in recent years.  Many similar churches had their ornamentation stripped and their paintings plastered over as part of the iconoclasm of Sweden's adoption of Lutheranism.\nApart from religious activities, there is the annual festival Sjöbo marknad, which translates to English as Sjöbo fair. It was first held in 1864, and is now held in late July, attracting some 100,000 visitors, making it one of the largest country fairs in Sweden. It has carousels and is otherwise noted for its pottery vendors and trade.\n\nRefugee controversy\nSjöbo Municipality reached the public eye in Sweden in 1988 when, under the leadership of the  Municipal Commissioner Sven-Olle Olsson, it voted by a majority of 67% in a referendum that it would not accept foreign asylum seekers. Most other municipalities in Sweden accepted refugees that came from troubled countries such as former Yugoslavia and Iraq.\n\nDemographics\nThis is a demographic table based on Sjöbo Municipality's electoral districts in the 2022 Swedish general election sourced from SVT's election platform, in turn taken from SCB official statistics.\nIn total there were 19,473 inhabitants, including 14,943 Swedish citizens of voting age. 28.8% voted for the left coalition and 70.1% for the right coalition. With 42.6 % of the vote, Sjöbo saw the highest result in the entire country for the Sweden Democrats. Indicators are in percentage points except population totals and income.\n\nElections\nThese are the results of elections held since the 1972 municipal reform. In 2014 Sjöbo Municipality became the first municipality in Sweden where the Sweden Democrats held the largest share of the votes. The high number of \"missing\" votes from the list from 1991 belonged to the Sjöbo Party. The Sweden Democrats numbers in 1988-1998 were not listed at a municipal level by the SCB due to the party's small size domestically.\n\nRiksdag\nBlocs\nThis lists the relative strength of the socialist and centre-right blocs since 1973, but parties not elected to the Riksdag are inserted as \"other\", including the Sweden Democrats results from 1988 to 2006, but also the Christian Democrats pre-1991 and the Greens in 1982, 1985 and 1991. The sources are identical to the table above. The coalition or government mandate marked in bold formed the government after the election. New Democracy got elected in 1991 but are still listed as \"other\" due to the short lifespan of the party.\n\nReferences\nStatistics Sweden\nInfo about Sjöbo Refugee question from a Nationalistic website: Sweden the extreme Way\nGeography & Activities: Tourist broshure Sjöbo Kommun, (2005), available at the tourist office in Swedish, English and German.\n\nExternal links\n\nSjöbo - Official site\nCoat of arms",

    "title": "Ronald Reagan Speaks Out Against Socialized Medicine",
    "text": "Ronald Reagan Speaks Out Against Socialized Medicine is a 1961 LP featuring the actor and future U.S. president Ronald Reagan. In this ten-minute recording, Reagan \"criticized Social Security for supplanting private savings and warned that subsidized medicine would curtail Americans' freedom\" and that \"pretty soon your son won't decide when he's in school, where he will go or what he will do for a living. He will wait for the government to tell him.\" Roger Lowenstein called the LP part of a \"stealth program\" conducted by the American Medical Association (see Operation Coffee Cup).\n\nSummary\nReagan opens by saying that in 1927 socialist Norman Thomas said that the American people would never vote for socialism, but \"under the name of liberalism the American people would adopt every fragment of the socialist program.\" Snopes.com calls this attribution probably false, arguing that \"no one has ever been able to turn up a source\".\nReagan says that \"Government has invaded the free precincts of private citizens,\" stating that the U.S. government owns \"1/5 of the total industrial capacity of the United States.\" Reagan says \"One of the traditional methods of imposing statism or socialism on a people has been by way of medicine. It's very easy to disguise a medical program as a humanitarian project; most people are a little reluctant to oppose anything that suggests medical care for people who possibly can't afford it.\" Reagan cites the failure of President Harry S. Truman's national health insurance proposal as evidence of the American people's rejection of socialized medicine.\nReagan describes Representative Aime Forand as having introduced a bill which would institute \"compulsory health insurance\" for all people of social security age. Forand is quoted as having said, \"If we can only break through and get our foot inside the door, then we can extend the program after that.\" Forand is likened to labor union leader Walter Reuther, who is quoted as having said, \"It's no secret that the United Automobile Workers is officially on record of backing a program of national health insurance.\" The Forand bill is described as being praised by socialists: \"They say once the Forand bill is passed this nation will be provided with a mechanism for socialized medicine capable of indefinite expansion in every direction until it includes the entire population. Now we can't say we haven't been warned.\"\nReagan describes Representative Cecil R. King of California as the successor to Congressman Forand in his support for a bill that would provide senior citizens with medical care; this bill was being championed by President John F. Kennedy at the time. (The 1962 King-Anderson bill is often described as a precursor to the Social Security Act of 1965, which established Medicare.) Reagan cites the expansion of private health insurance and the passage of the 1960 Kerr-Mills Act, which provided federal funds to states to cover the \"medically needy,\" as evidence that King's legislation is unnecessary. Reagan concludes that the new bill is \"simply an excuse to bring about what they wanted all the time: socialized medicine.\" Reagan warns against the danger of encroaching on the relationship between patients and doctors, and of an attack on doctors' freedoms.\nReagan encourages his listeners to join a letter-writing campaign to Congress with the message, \"We do not want socialized medicine.\" Reagan quotes Representative Charles A. Halleck of Indiana as having said, \"When the American people wants something from Congress, regardless of its political complexion, if they make their wants known, Congress does what the people want.\" Reagan warns that if his listeners do not stop the proposed medical program, \"behind it will come other government programs that will invade every area of freedom as we have known it in this country until one day as Norman Thomas said we will wake to find that we have socialism.\" Under this scenario, Reagan says, \"We are going to spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children, what it once was like in America when men were free.\"\n\nCriticism\nIn 1966, Governor Pat Brown, campaigning for re-election against Reagan, said of Reagan's speech about socialized medicine, that Reagan was \"an enemy of social progress,\" who had \"hired\" out to the American Medical Association. In response, Reagan accused him of \"pure demagoguery\" in suggesting that California's elderly had reason to fear a Reagan victory in the race for governor.\nIn 1980, President Jimmy Carter, campaigning for re-election against Reagan, told crowds that: \"As a traveling salesman for the American Medical Association campaign against Medicare, [Reagan] sowed the fear that Medicare would mean socialism and that it would lead to the destruction of our freedom.\" When the subject arose in a televised debate in late October, Reagan responded: \"When I opposed Medicare, there was another piece of legislation meeting the same problem before Congress. I happened to favor the other piece of legislation and thought it would be better for the senior citizens. ... I was not opposing the principle of providing care for them...\" Carter's campaign accused Reagan of \"rewriting history\", saying that there was no such alternative legislation.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nTranscript of the album\nTranscript of the speech with audio\nRecording in its entirety from YouTube",

    "text": "The 3rd Ohio Cavalry Regiment was a cavalry regiment of the Union Army during the American Civil War.\nThe regiment was organized in September 1861 by future Colonel Lewis Zahm. In April 1862, it moved with General Don Carlos Buell through Tennessee. During that summer, the 3rd Ohio Cavalry participated in the Siege of Corinth. It later fought at the Battle of Chickamauga. In January 1864, the regiment was re-formed as its three-year term had expired. The unit later participated in raids with Stoneman and Wilson before it was discharged on August 14, 1865. Charles Oliver Brown, D.D. followed his father at the age of thirteen, Major Oliver M. Brown, with the unit, served throughout the war and became the \"Boy Bugler\" of Sherman's Army.\nSeveral Kelleys Island men volunteered and served in the 3rd Ohio Cavalry including: Pitt Simmons, John Ward, John Monaghan, Stephen French, Michael Hughes, August Raab, John T. Woodford, George Wright, Henry Pope and Jacob Rush (mostly companies A and L). Jacob Rush's involvement in the unit was particularly interesting. He enlisted at the age of 15, was brought home by his parents, then allowed to enlist again a few months later. Just weeks before his enlistment expired, he was sent on one last mission and captured as a spy. He provided a first hand account of his interrogation by General Nathan Bedford Forrest. He spent 8 months in Cahaba Prison where he helped organize a (failed) escape attempt. Upon his release at the end of the war, he was one of the few soldiers who survived the 'Sultana' explosion. He worked his way home and established the Island House resort on Kelleys Island. When that burned in 1877, he moved to Larned, Kansas and played a key role in building that city. He also served as a Kansas State Senator. He was a prolific writer for the local newspaper, the Islander, and shared many stories of his time in service in the 3rd Ohio Cavalry.\n\nSee also\nList of Ohio Civil War units\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "Dominik Thalhammer (born 2 October 1970) is an Austrian football manager, best known for bringing Austria's women to the brink of the Euros final at their first ever major championship, and later spells at Cercle Brugge and KV Oostende in Belgian men's football.\n\nCoaching career\nEarly career\nThalhammer first made his name at FC Admira Wacker Mödling, being appointed as U18 coach at the age of 29. Impressing as both U18 and reserve team coach, Thalhammer was put in charge of the first team in 2004, making the then 33-year-old the youngest coach in the history of the Austrian Bundesliga.\nLeaving the role after eleven months with Admira losing their first six games of the 2005-06 season, and having moved through a series of Austrian men's clubs through the 2000s, Thalhammer made a switch to women's football in 2011.\n\nAustria women's team coach\nThalhammer was appointed coach of both the Austria women's national team and the Austrian U17 women in 2011. In his first campaign in charge, Austria reached the Euro play-offs for the first time in their history, losing to Russia in their bid to reach Euro 2013 in Sweden.\nWith the U17s, Thalhammer achieved the first qualification of an Austrian women's national team for the finals of any European Championship, which took place in England in 2014. There they narrowly missed out on a place in the semi-finals after a 0-0 draw against Portugal, a 2-1 defeat against England and a 1-0 win over Italy.\nAfter finishing second in their qualifying group for the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup behind France, with only the group winners going through to the finals, Austria qualified for a major tournament for the first time, Euro 2017 held in the Netherlands.\nBeating Switzerland and Iceland in the group stage, added to a draw against France, Austria qualified for the knockout stages on their debut, with a shock victory achieved in the quarter-finals over Spain on penalties after a goalless draw.\nAnother shoot-out in the semis against Denmark saw them edged out in another shoot-out, where Austria failed to score. The sensational run saw Thalhammer nominated as FIFA Women's World Coach of the Year, where he finished eighth.\nAustria would go on to miss out on qualification for the 2019 FIFA World Cup, despite losing only two of their eight qualifying games, both of those to eventual group-winners Spain, with the only automatic spot available from the group taken by the future 2023 World Cup winners, who won all eight qualifying group games.\n\nLASK Linz\nAfter nine years as Austria women's coach, Thalhammer stepped down to return to the men's game for the 2020-2021 season with LASK Linz, guiding the Upper Austrians to fourth-place, qualifying for the UEFA Europa League, and reaching the 2021 Cup Final, where they lost to Red Bull Salzburg.\nLASK got off to a bad start in the 2021-22 season, falling to second-last by the seventh matchday, dropping out of the Europa League into the Conference League. Thalhammer was dismissed from LASK in September 2021.\n\nCercle Brugge and KV Oostende\nWithin two months, Thalhammer was approached by lowly Belgian Pro League team Cercle Brugge, who were second-from-bottom and fighting relegation. The Austrian won seven of his first eight games in charge at Cercle, finishing the 2021-22 Pro League season 10th of the 18 clubs, missing out on the European play-offs by two places.  A poor start to the following campaign saw him replaced in September 2022 by his assistant Miron Muslic.\nThalhammer quickly moved to nearby KV Oostende, but with the club suffering from a severe lack of funding, they were relegated at the end of the 2022–23 Belgian Pro League season, and Thalhammer stood down as coach.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nDominik Thalhammer at WorldFootball.net",

    "title": "Doppler Labs",
    "text": "Doppler Labs was a San Francisco-based audio technology company, founded in 2013. The company designed and manufactured in-ear computing technology, including earplugs and wireless smart earbuds.\n\nHistory\nDoppler Labs was co-founded by Noah Kraft, Fritz Lanman, and Dan Wiggins. Kraft had previously worked in the entertainment industry, and was employed as a strategic consultant for Google working for John Hanke on a mobile game called Ingress. Kraft also worked for Lyor Cohen during the founding of 300 Entertainment. Lanman was an executive at Microsoft and a prominent angel investor.  Dan Wiggins is a long-time veteran in the acoustics and technology world who has worked for Rode, Event Electronics, Siemens, Microsoft, SONOS, Apple, Dolby and many more.\nBefore voice assistants or true wireless technology were prevalent, Doppler Labs envisioned that computing would move onto the body and into the ear and that voice would become a more primary interface for how humans interact with technology. With Apple's removal of the headphone jack, the launch of the AirPods, and the prevalence of Alexa, the smart earbud category that Doppler helped create was expected to become a $40 billion industry by 2020.\nIn July 2015, Doppler raised $17 million in series B funding bringing the company's total funding to over $50 million.  The round was led by The Chernin Group, Wildcat Capital Management, and Acequia Capital and included luminary investors like Henry Kravis, David Geffen, Blake Krikorian, Dan Gilbert, David Bonderman and Barry Sternlicht.\nDoppler Labs first product was DUBS Acoustic Filters, high-tech ear plugs designed that used a proprietary 17-piece physical acoustic filter system to reduce the sound pressure at different frequencies while maintaining acoustical fidelity. In July 2016, Doppler Labs Labs launched Here Active Listening at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and in 2017 launched its flagship product Here One, a pair of wireless smart earbuds  that allowed users to selectively filter ambient sound, stream music, and amplify speech. It could also be used to take phone calls and selectively filter certain sounds, such as background noise. Here One was called the world's first in-ear computer.\nIn March 2017, Doppler Labs sued Bose for trademark infringement of their Here Buds trademark.\nThe company supported the Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act of 2017 (OTC Hearing Aid Act).\nOn November 1, 2017, Doppler Labs announced that the company would be winding down operations, and officially closed on December 1.

    "text": "Deep Freeze (ディープフリーズ, Dīpufurīzu) is a 1999 Japanese video game released for the Sony PlayStation. It is a three-dimensional action-adventure game that was developed by Talon Inc. and published by Sammy. The story focuses on a counter-terrorist unit known as INTER-ANTS (International Anti-terrorist Service).\n\nGameplay\nThe game is set in 2001, when a terrorist organization known as Hephaestus has risen, with the aforementioned INTER-ANTS being formed as a response to combat them.\nDeep Freeze is an action adventure game. All the characters act in teams. At the beginning of each mission, players can pick one of five characters who will play as a partner and provide cover fire. This computer-controlled partner can be controlled through simple commands.\nThe game features many weapons the player can choose from the start, including a shotgun, Uzi submachine gun, and magnum handgun. Players can also collect grenades in the game, which can flush out enemies hidden behind obstacles such as barrels. The player can also perform rolls, which allows them to dodge bullets from enemies.\nDespite being released in Japan only, the game features English voice acting. However, all the menus in the game are in Japanese.\nThe game uses pre-rendered backgrounds and camera switching in a similar fashion to the game Resident Evil.\n\nRelease\nThe game was shown at the 2000 Tokyo Games Show gaming convention in Japan. The publisher, Sammy, was more well known at the time for developing pachinko games.\nDeep Freeze was released on January 14, 1999, for the Sony PlayStation home console, and was published by Sammy. The game was re-released on July 19, 2000, in the SuperLite 1500 budget line of games. The game has never been released outside of Japan, nor has it ever been released on the PlayStation Network game archives either.\n\nReception\nThe game received mostly positive reviews upon release. Famitsu gave the game a score of 26 out of 40. Ralph Karels writing in the German video game magazine Video Games gave it a 75 out of 100. He recommended the game for fans of Resident Evil series, and those who like import games. However, he cautioned that knowledge of Japanese is needed to complete the game because the menus are in Japanese. Super Gamepower gave it a score of 4 out of 5 in all categories (sound, graphics, fun, control) and an overall score of 4 out of 5. The writer described the game as like Resident Evil, with more action and shooting but less blood and gore.\nMega Fun gave it a 78.\nGamers' Republic gave the game a score of C and was rather critical of it. The writer says that the mixture of fast action and pre-rendered backgrounds does not mix and causes disorientation. The writer explained that such a format worked for Resident Evil since it was slower paced, it doesn't work in Deep Freeze. Also, the writer commented on the voice acting, calling it \"horrendous\" and said the enemy AI was too passive for simply standing there while the player reloaded.\n\nSee also\nHard Edge\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "ABC Highway",
    "text": "The ABC Highway is the main urban highway in Barbados. Opened in 1989, it is named after three famous Barbadian politicians: John Michael Geoffrey Manningham (\"Tom\") Adams, Errol Barrow, and Hugh Gordon Cummins.  From the east, the highway stretches from the Grantley Adams International Airport in Christ Church, to the western end at Cave Hill Road and University Drive, Cave Hill Campus, University of the West Indies, in Saint Michael. It roughly encircles the Parish of Saint Michael and the wider metropolitan area of Bridgetown.\n\nRoute description\nThe highway consists of two-lane and dual carriageway sections with at-grade intersections, mostly roundabouts.  A 2006–2007 expansion project enlarged some areas, and there was some public sentiment voiced in local media about the project's lack of a competitive tender process or studies to justify costs. On July 24, 2006, Rayside Construction and C.O. Williams Construction, two local companies, began the construction and widening of the ABC Highway from the Darcy Scott Roundabout in Warrens, St. Michael to the Garfield Sobers Roundabout in Bartletts, Christ Church. As part of the project, the old streetlights and traffic lights at the junctions of the ABC Highway and Pine East-West Boulevard, Upton Road at BET Hill on Highway R and Highway 6 were removed, and jersey barriers were constructed in the center. Additionally, new HPS streetlights were installed along the highway, and new roundabouts, including the Samuel Jackman Prescod and Darcy Scott Roundabouts in Warrens and the Pine, St. Michael, were constructed. The Greater Warrens Traffic Improvement Project was started from late December 2010 into early January 2011 to mid-December 2014 with construction and widening of Jackson Road on Highway 2 to the newly constructed Jackson Roundabout around the Baobab Tree and Lodge Hill, St. Michael, two Warrens Mini Roundabouts in Warrens, St. Michael and the Welches and Redmans Village Roundabouts in St. Thomas. On 27 April 2008, during its effect, they changed the junctions from a two-way street into a one-way street with the Wildey \"Y\" Junction of Upton Road on Highway R, the ABC Highway and Highway 6. There was also a footbridge construction at the Pine, St. Michael, from early September to late November 2012. They had also installed two new traffic lights; one at the pedestrian crossing at Mount Friendship, St. Michael, and another at Redman's Village, St. Thomas. The construction of the four-lane highway was finished by 31 August 2009. Also, the same construction with the Greater Warrens Traffic Improvement Project had started with the widening of the Ronald Mapp Highway on Highway 2A from the top of Warrens Hill, St. Michael to the top of Redman's Village, St. Thomas with the installation of jersey barriers and new streetlights along  Highway 2A, Jackson Road on Highway 2 and the Warrens South Road with three roundabouts: two mini and a circular roundabout. Highway 2A between the top of Warrens Hill in St. Michael to the top of Redman's Village in St. Thomas via Welches in St. Thomas, was unfinished and incomplete and will soon be finished and completed after the elections of the new BLP Government. Finally, in the parish of St. Michael, from late April 2001 to late October 2003, they constructed from its entrance and exit to Dalkeith Road at the Garrison Savannah along with the junctions of Dalkeith Road and Harts Road; Dalkeith Road, Dalkeith Hill, Beckles Road and Culloden Road; Culloden Road, Pine Road, Bishop's Court Hill and Collymore Rock; Pine Road, with a reconstruction of Nita Barrow Roundabout, Pine Hill, Welches Road and Belmont Road, Government Hill, Welches Main Road and Tweedside Road; the junction of Roebuck Street and Country Road; the junction of Country Road, Passage Road, Whitepark Road and Bank Hall Road; the junction of Passage Road, Westbury Road, Baxters Road and Barbarees Hill; the junction of Westbury Road, Westbury Main Road, Prescod Boulevard and President Kennedy Drive; the junction of Eagle Hall Main Road, Black Rock Road, Barbarees Hill and Tudor Bridge; the junction of Black Rock Road, Black Rock Main Road, Deacons Road and Fairfield Road, some of the traffic lights and streetlights; and the junction of Black Rock Main Road, Brighton Road and Yearwood Road; and also they constructed Baxters Road before they removed all the old utility poles and replaced them with some of the CFL English lampposts.\n\nJunctions\nRoute to port\nThe ABC Highway provides relatively easy of access to the Deep Water Harbour in Bridgetown. At the official western terminus, the road becomes University Drive (at Cave Hill). The route proceeds to the Frank Worrel roundabout, where it has a junction with Highway 1 and the MacDonald 'Mighty Grynner' Blennman (formerly \"Spring Garden\") Highway. Direct access to the harbor is available via the M.G Highway from the Frank Worrel roundabout. At the end of M.G. Highway, direct access to the port is accessed by turning right onto President Kennedy Drive.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n  \n\n\"Totally Barbados\".

    "title": "Dyadic kinship term",
    "text": "Dyadic kinship terms (abbreviated DY or DYAD) are kinship terms in a few languages that express the relationship between individuals as they relate one to the other. In English, there are a few set phrases for such situations, such as \"they are father and son\", but there is not a single dyadic term that can be used the way \"they are cousins\" can; even the latter is not truly dyadic, as it does not necessarily mean that they are cousins to each other. The few, and uncommon, English dyadic terms involve in-laws: co-mothers-in-law, co-fathers-in-law, co-brothers-in-law, co-sisters-in-law, co-grandmothers, and co-grandfathers. \nExamples of dyadic terms for blood kin include Kayardild (Australian) ngamathu-ngarrba \"mother and child\", derived from ngamathu \"mother\", and kularrin-ngarrba \"brother and sister\", from kularrin \"cross-sibling\", with the dyadic suffix -ngarrba. Not all such terms are derived; the Ok language Mian has a single unanalysable root lum for \"father and child\".\nDyadic blood-kin terms are rare in Indo-European languages. Examples are Icelandic and Faroese, which have the terms feðgar \"father and son\", feðgin \"father and daughter\", mæðgin \"mother and son\", mæðgur \"mother and daughter\".\nChinese and Japanese use compound nouns to make dyadic terms, such as (in Japanese) 親子 oyako \"parent and child\", 兄弟 kyōdai \"brothers; siblings\", 姉妹 shimai \"sisters\", and 夫婦 fūfu \"husband and wife\".\nThe languages which have such terms are concentrated in the western Pacific. There are at least ten in New Guinea, including Oksapmin, Menya, and the Ok languages; fifteen or more Austronesian languages, from Taiwan to New Caledonia; and at least sixty in Australia, such as Kayardild above. There are sporadic examples in Northern Eurasia, including a few Turkic and Uralic languages, Yukaghir, and Ainu; depending on definitions, the Yi languages of Southeast Asia may also be said to have such terms. Elsewhere they are rare, or at least have not been described. Known languages include Athabaskan (Koyukon and Carrier), Pomo, and Southern Paiute in North America, Quechua, Paezan (Nasa Yuwe), and Cariban (Tiriyo) in South America, Adyghe in the Caucasus, and Khoe (Kxoe, Gǀwi) in southern Africa.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "Laapata (Urdu: لاپتہ, lit. 'Astray') is a 2021 Pakistani drama television series, produced by Momina Duraid under her banner MD Productions and directed by Khizer Idrees. It stars Ali Rehman Khan as a titular holder \"Laapata\" along with Sarah Khan and Ayeza Khan in leading roles.\n\nPlot\nThe story revolves around three characters of the same household; Falak, a badminton player (played by Sarah Khan), Geeti, a tiktoker (played by Ayeza Khan), and Shams a gambler and later a millworker (played by Ali Rehman Khan). Geeti and Falak are first cousins and Shams' family was taken in by them when they were children. Falak and Shams are deeply in love and consult their family for marriage, to which they agree. Meanwhile, Geeti and her friend Nasreen (played by Inaya Khan) are scheming and trying their best to get Geeti and Shams together. Geeti has feelings for Shams, but it was more so her rivalry with Falak that caused this ruckus. Nevertheless, after many failed attempts at winning Shams over, Falak and Shams get engaged. Everything is going well until Shams gets caught in one of his gambling schemes. Shams became involved with a don in the gambling scene (who was also a cop) and was arrested after not being able to pay his dues from losing a bet. Through this illegal arrest, he was unrightfully sentenced for many years under terrorism instead for gambling. This was done by the same cop and gambler that Shams lost against (played by Saife Hassan). Shams was \"Laapata\" and nobody knew where he went.\nAfter two years, after winning the badminton championship, Falak decided to get a job, where she meets Daniyal, her boss (played by Mirza Gohar Rasheed). Daniyal is interested in Falak and proposes to her to which she rejects. However, after slowly winning her over and after losing any hope of Shams' return, Daniyal and Falak get married in an intimate ceremony, after which they relocate to Islamabad, where Daniyal works and resides. After many spurs of weird behaviors from Daniyal it is revealed that he is mentally unwell and is seeing a therapist and takes medications to control his anger. Meanwhile, Geeti is making successful Tik Toks, but also falls in love with an online friend, only to get robbed of her mother's jewelry.\nIn Islamabad, during a party, Falak learns from some of Daniyal's friends that Daniyal was married before, but ended up divorced. Rumour has it that Daniyal actually murdered his ex-wife because he suspected that she was cheating on him and couldn't control his anger. In Karachi, after a visit to Shams' prison cell by survey cops, they discover that he was wrongfully sentenced by the same cop two years ago. This is discovered due to an ongoing investigation after the murder of the same cop that sentenced Shams for terrorism. Shams is immediately bailed and sent home. After two years, Shams returns home and is shocked and saddened to learn of Falak's marriage. After a confronting phone call from an upset Falak, Shams decides to move on and finds a job in a local factory as a millworker supervisor. Geeti asks her mother to get her engaged to Shams as now Falak has cleared her path. Her mother initially hesitates because of Shams' past but agrees and talks to Shams's parents. They also agreed and Shams and Geeti get engaged.\nOn the contrary, Falak has been overwhelmed by Daniyal's true character. She fights with Daniyal who in return turns really hyper and breaks Falak's phone. Upon finding a picture of Shams and Falak together, Daniyal slaps Falak across the face, to which she responds to by slapping him back. After a series of similar events, Daniyal is on the verge of killing Falak when their maid Munira hits him with a frypan and he faints. Falak was told that she had to trust Munira as she was the one who knew Daniyal's first wife and of her murder. The drama goes into a series of flashbacks and it is shown that Daniyal had married a Pakhtoon woman named Aliya (played by Momina Iqbal) whose father had captured the lands of Daniyal's father. Despite the family rivalry and differences, Daniyal and Aliya marry with the help of Aliya's brother as her father would obviously disapprove. They live happily. Daniyal orders Aliya not to meet her relatives until they migrate to America. She accepts. One day Aliya told Munira to return to her home (and she did) and behind her back she invites a man whom Munira has never seen. This happened everyday until one day Munira calls Daniyal and tells him that Aliya has been cheating on him. Daniyal then comes home, catches her, and shoots her on the spot. She instantly dies. It is revealed that the boy was none other than her own brother who helped her in marriage. Her brother told Daniyal that after their marriage, Aliya's father had died and he was here to inherit the lands to Aliya's name. Daniyal is shocked and Aliya's brother calls the police so Daniyal shoots him too. He tells Munira not to tell anyone about their murders.\nThe scene comes to the present and Falak is living in Munira's house. The next morning, after tracking down Falak, Daniyal comes to Munira's house. During an altercation, Falak takes a steel jug and attacks Daniyal on the same spot where he was hit with a frying pan. Falak flees to her home in Karachi and Munira and her husband leave Daniyal. It was later revealed to Falak that Daniyal died due to her attack, which comes to her as a huge shock. Meanwhile, Shams and Geeti are engaged. Falak comes just before the engagement and Shams becomes very happy to see her again. But, Geeti doesn't like it. Falak lies to her family about everything and says that she and Daniyal are going to America, so she is living here for a while and after which she will flee to America. Geeti senses that Falak and Shams are hitting it off again, and so she does some digging. She finds out that Daniyal is dead and that Falak is the murderer. She secretly calls the police and on the day of the wedding, the police come to arrest Falak for murdering Daniyal. The wedding is called off. Daniyal's friend's wife, a lawyer, helps Falak in her case as she was being held accountable as a murderer and was even sent to a male prison. Through a few court trials and after losing hope Shams doesn't know what to do. Geeti is scheming in every which way that she can to win over Shams, but upon discovering what she did, he vows to never marry her, even is Falak is sentenced to death. Geeti has a mental breakdown and can't believe that she has truly lost. Eventually, Falak is set free with the help of her lawyer and returns home. Falak and Shams finally get married. The drama ended with an iconic scene where Geeti was seen weeping of her demise and not finding love.

However, after a few episodes when the harassment scene was cleared up by Geeti's character, it was actually praised for its positive messaging. On its premiere, it received mixed reviews due to the storyline going in too many directions but was heavily praised for its direction.\nA reviewer from MERA FM 107.4 criticized the \"poor and cliched\" storyline and Ayeza Khan's acting, calling her character \"problematic\", and expressed concern over the drama's portrayal of harassment allegations.\n\nSoundtrack\nThe official soundtrack of the serial was performed by Kiran Waseem and Tehseen W.

    "text": "Paul Hervieu (2 September 1857 – 25 October 1915) was a French novelist and playwright.\n\nEarly years\nHe was born Paul-Ernest Hervieu  in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France.\nHervieu was born into a wealthy upper-middle-class family. \nHe studied law, but sought also had contact with writers like Leconte de Lisle, Paul Verlaine and Alphonse Daudet. After graduating in 1877, he first practiced in a law firm, in 1879 qualified for the diplomatic service, and was posted in the French Embassy in Mexico. \nBut he preferred to remain in France, where he attended fashionable literary salons, and the acquaintance of artists and writers such as Marcel Proust, Paul Bourget, Henri Meilhac, Ludovic Halévy, Guy de Maupassant and Edgar Degas. On the recommendation of his friend Octave Mirbeau, he tried his hand as a journalist.\n\nCareer\nHervieu was called to the bar in 1877, and, after serving some time in the office of the president of the council, he qualified for the diplomatic service, but resigned on his nomination in 1881 to a secretaryship in the French legation in Mexico.\nHe contributed novels, tales and essays to the chief Parisian papers and reviews, and published a series of clever novels, including L'Inconnue (1887), Flirt (1890, illustrated by Madeleine Lemaire), L'Exorcisée (1891), Peints par eux-mêmes (1893), an ironic study written in the form of letters, and L'Armature (1895), dramatized in 1905 by Eugène Brieux.\nHervieu's plays are built upon a severely logical method, the mechanism of which is sometimes so evident as to destroy the necessary sense of illusion.

    "title": "Ahmed Asim",
    "text": "Ahmed Asim (born 29 November 1981) is a Maldivian actor, editor, director, and writer who has established a career in the Maldives Film Industry.\n\nCareer\nAsim made his screen debut with a video single alongside Jamsheedha Ahmed. His first film release was Mohamed Abdul Hakeem and Mohamed Nasheed directed family drama Kaiveneege Furathama Rey (1999) though he was first offered to play a role Haajara Abdul Kareem-directed Ajaaib (2000) which was released a year later. In the latter, Asim starred alongside Mariyam Nazima, Koyya Hassan Manik and Waleedha Waleed which depicts the relationship of two exemplary wives and their respective families regardless of societal norms.\nAsim made a guest appearance in Yoosuf Shafeeu directed horror film Edhathuru (2004) which revolves around eight friends who go on a picnic to a haunted uninhabited island and their battle for survival. The film garnered critical appreciation specially for its sound effect and was a commercial success. The same year, he starred alongside Niuma Mohamed, Ali Seezan and Sheereen Abdul Wahid in Ahmed Nimal's horror film Handhu Keytha (2005) which unfolds the story of a man who was enchanted by a spirit while witnessing a lunar eclipse. In the film, he played the friend of Ziyan who has been possessed by the spirit. He next appeared in a brief role in Abdul Fatthah's critically praised romantic film Vehey Vaarey Therein (2003). Featuring Yoosuf Shafeeu, Jamsheedha Ahmed, Khadheeja Ibrahim Didi, Mohamed Shavin, Amira Ismail and Aminath Rasheedha in crucial roles, the film narrates the story of unrequited love, and proved to be one of the highest-grossing Maldivian films of the year. He rose to widespread prominence in the television industry with his performance as the only child in the family who marries his best-friend in the Arifa Ibrahim-directed critically acclaimed television series, Vairoalhi Ahves Sirrun (2005) which revolves around two best-friends involved in extra-marital affairs and who fail to practice their duty as husband and wife. Starring alongside Niuma Mohamed, Lufshan Shakeeb, Aminath Rasheedha and Mariyam Shakeela, the series was listed as one of the most successful television series.\nHis last release of the year was a collaboration with Fathimath Nahula in the critically appreciated and commercially prosperous project, a romantic drama film Zuleykha (2005) which narrates the journey of a nine years old girl seeking the lost love of her mother. Featuring an ensemble cast including Sheela Najeeb, Yoosuf Shafeeu, Ali Seezan, Mohamed Manik and Mariyam Enash Sinan, he played a small role of a defeated man in love. Thirty three housefull shows of the film were screened at the cinema making it the highest grossing Maldivian release of the year. The following year, Asim again collaborated with the team of Vairoalhi Ahves Sirrun for Arifa Ibrahim's another romantic television drama series, Vaguthu Faaithu Nuvanees (2006) which consists of fifty episodes. The series which follows the vengeance and retribution two best-friends go through when they both love the same person, features Asim in a role as an overly-attached boyfriend who reconciles with his father.\nIn 2009, Asim appeared in Ali Shifau's suspense thriller Happy Birthday which narrates the story of a simple man who receives a call on his birthday informing that his wife and son have been kidnapped, only to be returned for a ransom. Asim played the role of Ahmed, the younger brother of a straightforward man who had an unfortunate birthday. A total of five shows with little occupancy were screened at the cinema, declaring the film a commercial failure, despite the positive response from the critics. Winning five Gaumee Film Awards and twelve Maldives Film Awards, the film was also screened at the Venice Film Festival.\nThe next year, Asim starred in Abdul Fahtah's horror film Jinni alongside Ali Seezan and Mariyam Afeefa. Based on true incidents that occurred in an island of Maldives, he played the friend of Thahumeena who ultimately proposes her. Prior to release the film was marketed to be full of \"suspense and uniqueness\" compared to other mediocre Maldivian horror films. Upon release, the film received mixed reviews from critics; majority of them complaining for having the \"same old feeling\" of prior horror flicks though the performance were noted to be satisfactory. Despite the mixed reviews, the film witnessed a positive response at the box office, screening a total of twenty two housefull shows in Male', declaring it as a Mega-Hit.\nIn 2011, Asim played the role of Azeem, the boyfriend of an introverted prudent girl living a modest lifestyle, in the Moomin Fuad-directed crime tragedy drama Loodhifa. Featuring an ensemble cast, the film deals with current social issues in the society told from different perspectives of the characters. Made on a budget of MVR 600,000, the film was declared a commercial failure though it received widespread critical acclaim. His work in the film garnered him several award nominations, including a Gaumee Film Award nomination as the Best Editor and a nomination for the Best Supporting Actor and Best Editor in 2nd Maldives Film Awards. Asim's only release of 2017 was Ali Musthafa-directed Malikaa which did not do well at the box office.\nAsim returned to the mainstream film-making with the Moomin Fuad-directed psychological horror thriller Nivairoalhi (2019) which marks Niuma Mohamed's last onscreen film. He spent two years in preparation for the character portrayal. \nStarring opposite Mohamed and Yoosuf Shafeeu, the film received majorly positive reviews from critics; Aishath Maaha of Dho? favored the performance of the lead actors and mentioned the \"neat arrangement\" of its screenplay though pointed out its \"weak ending\" to be unsatisfactory. Praising his performance as a religious extremist, Maaha wrote: \"The most authentic and best performance by a leading actor in this film has to be Asim's performance fully justifying the hardworking undertaken behind the camera\". Similar sentiments were echoed from Aminath Luba of Sun, where she picked Asim to be \"outstanding\" from the cast and opined he still has the \"acting touch\" though absent from the cinema for around seven years\".\n\nFilmography\nFeature film\nTelevision\nShort film\nOther work\nAccolades\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "History of Canada (1763–1867)",
    "text": "Starting with the 1763 Treaty of Paris, New France, of which the colony of Canada was a part, formally became a part of the British Empire. The Royal Proclamation of 1763 enlarged the colony of Canada under the name of the Province of Quebec, which with the Constitutional Act 1791 became known as the Canadas. With the Act of Union 1840, Upper and Lower Canada were joined to become the Province of Canada.\nBy the 1860s, interest developed in forming a new federation between the Canadas and the other British colonies of British North America, that led to Confederation in 1867. A number of other British colonies that are today part of Canada, such as Newfoundland and British Columbia, and large territories such as Rupert's Land, initially remained outside the newly formed federation.\n\nNew France under British rule\nIn North America, the Seven Years' War had seen Great Britain conquer the entirety of the French colony of Canada. The war officially ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on February 10, 1763. As part of the treaty, France formally renounced its claims to all its North American lands to Britain (of which the French colony of Canada was a part), except Louisiana (which had been instead ceded to Spain), and two islands off the shores of Newfoundland (Saint-Pierre and Miquelon).\n\nSt. Lawrence valley\nWith the addition of Canada to the British Empire, Britain gained control of a strip of territory along the St. Lawrence River with a population of at least 70,000 francophone Roman Catholics, which was expanded and renamed as the Province of Quebec under the Quebec Act of 1774. Although many British people (including the American colonies to the south) hoped the French Canadians would be assimilated this was not the case as distinct rules of governance for Quebec were set out in the Quebec Act such as allowing the French Canadians to retain their Catholic religion and their French system of civil law. The Quebec Act became one of the Intolerable Acts that infuriated the thirteen British colonies in what would become the United States of America.\n\nAtlantic coast\nThe island colony of Newfoundland had been dominated by the British for a long time before the French finally abandoned any claims to the area. An anglophone society had already taken shape prior to 1763, although two islands were reserved for French fishermen.\nIn the Maritimes, the British had previously expelled many of the French colonists of Acadia in 1755 to Louisiana, but this would not be repeated in 1763. The remaining indigenous Mi'kmaq and Wabanaki Confederacy had laid down arms and pledged loyalty to the British Crown. The British Conquest of Acadia (which included Nova Scotia peninsula, but not present-day New Brunswick) happened in 1710, and the British had already established settlements, including Halifax. The establishment of Halifax sparked Father Le Loutre's War, which, in turn, led to the British expelling the Acadians from the region during the French and Indian War. As they later captured Cape Breton Island and Prince Edward Island, the policy of expulsion was extended there as well. The few Acadians who managed to return to the area have created the contemporary Acadian society. Once the Acadians were expelled, other settlements were formed by New England Planters.\n\nAmerican Revolution\nIn 1775, American revolutionaries (Patriots) attempted to push their insurrection into northeastern Quebec. Support for the Patriot cause was mixed; the clergy and landowners were generally opposed to it, while English-speaking merchants and migrants from the Thirteen Colonies were generally supportive of it. The habitants were divided; in some areas (notably the region between Montreal and Saint-Jean), there was significant support, and militia companies were raised in support of the Patriots by James Livingston.\n\nThe Patriots laid siege to Fort Saint-Jean, capturing it and Montreal in November 1775. They then marched on Quebec City, where an attempt to take the city on December 31, 1775, failed. Following an ineffectual siege, the arrival of British troops in May 1776 sent the Patriots into retreat back toward Montreal. An attempt against British troops at Trois-Rivières failed, and the Patriots were driven from the province in June. Leaving with the rebel army were about 250 Québécois in two regiments: James Livingston's 1st Canadian Regiment, and Moses Hazen's 2nd Canadian Regiment.\nQuebeckers living in the forts of the Great Lakes region also massively sided with the Patriots and were instrumental in the taking of the fort by the Patriots. Major Clément Gosselin, Pierre Ayotte, Antoine Paulin, Louis Gosselin, Germain Dionne, Pierre Douville, Edward Antill and Moses Hazen and 747 Quebec militiamen were all in Quebec when they joined the Patriots and defeated the British at Yorktown in 1781. In a key act leading up to the Siege of Yorktown, Louis-Philippe de Vaudreuil, the French-born nephew of French Canada's last French governor, the Marquis de Vaudreuil, assisted Bougainville and de Grasse in preventing the British Navy from resupplying or relieving Cornwallis' army in the Battle of the Chesapeake.\nIn Nova Scotia there was some agitation against British rule, largely instigated by Jonathan Eddy and John Allan, migrants from Massachusetts who had settled in the Chignecto Isthmus area near Fort Cumberland (formerly Fort Beauséjour). The only major event of their resistance was the Battle of Fort Cumberland, when Eddy and a combined force of Massachusetts Patriots, Acadians, and aboriginals besieged the fort in November 1776. The siege was broken and Eddy's forces were scattered when British reinforcements arrived. Eddy and Allan continued to make trouble on the frontier between what is now Maine and New Brunswick from a base in Machias for several years.\nThe Maritime provinces were also affected by privateering, and raids on settlements by privateers in violation of their letters of marque. In notable instances, Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island and Lunenburg, Nova Scotia were subjected to these raids.\nIn southwestern Quebec, the American forces had much better success there owing to the leadership of Virginia militia leader George Rogers Clark. In 1778, 200 men under Clark, supplied and supported mainly by Virginia, came down the Ohio River near Louisville, Kentucky, marched across southern Illinois, and then captured Kaskaskia without loss of life. From there, part of his men took Vincennes, but was soon lost to British Lieutenant Colonel Henry Hamilton, the commander at Fort Detroit. It was later retaken by Clark in the Siege of Fort Vincennes in February 1779. Roughly half of Clark's militia in the theatre were Canadien volunteers sympathetic to the American cause.\nIn the end, the British Empire was defeated in the Revolutionary War and formally ceded parts of southwestern Canada to the new United States as part of the Treaty of Paris. During and after the Revolution, approximately 70,000 or 15% United Empire Loyalists fled the United States, with the rest of the 85% choosing to stay in the new nation. Of these, roughly 50,000 Loyalists settled in the British North American colonies, which then consisted of Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Quebec, and Prince Edward Island (created 1769). The Loyalists who settled in western Nova Scotia wanted political freedom from Halifax, so Britain split off the colony of New Brunswick in 1784. Quebec was also divided into Lower Canada and Upper Canada under the Constitutional Act of 1791, permitting the 8,000 Loyalists who settled in southwestern Quebec (which became Upper Canada) to have a province in which British laws and institutions could be established.\nA number of Loyalists that came north after the American Revolution were of African descent including former slaves who had been freed as a result of service to the British and over 2,000 African slaves. In 1793 Upper Canada became the first British jurisdiction to enact legislation to suppress slavery, with the Act Against Slavery being passed allowing for its gradual abolition.\n\nPost-American Independence\nAfter the war the British expanded their mercantile interests in the North Pacific. Spain and Britain had become rivals in the area which came to a head with the Nootka Crisis in 1789. Both sides mobilised for war, and Spain counted on France for support; when France refused, Spain had to back down and capitulated to British terms leading to the Nootka Convention. The outcome of the crisis was a humiliation for Spain and a triumph for Britain, for the former had practically renounced all sovereignty on the North Pacific coast. This opened the way to British expansion in that area, and a number of expeditions took place; firstly a naval expedition led by George Vancouver which explored the inlets around the Pacific North West, particularly around Vancouver Island. On land, expeditions took place hoping for a discovery of a practicable river route to the Pacific for the extension of the North American fur trade, namely the North West Company. Sir Alexander Mackenzie led the first starting out in 1792 overland from Lake Athabasca via the Peace and Fraser Rivers, reaching the Pacific ocean near present-day Bella Coola on 20 July 1793. Mackenzie became the first European to reach the Pacific overland north of the Rio Grande which preceded the Lewis and Clark Expedition by twelve years. Shortly thereafter, Mackenzie's companion, John Finlay, founded the first permanent European settlement in British Columbia, Fort St. John. The North West Company sought further explorations firstly by David Thompson, starting in 1797, and later by Simon Fraser. These men pushed into the wilderness territories of the Rocky Mountains and Interior Plateau and all the way to the Strait of Georgia on the Pacific Coast expanding British North America Westward.\nFrom 1783 through 1801, the British Empire, including British North America (but not India, which was under the East India Company, and later the India Office), was administered by the Home Office and by the Home Secretary, then from 1801 to 1854 by the War Office (which became the War and Colonial Office) and Secretary of State for War and Colonies (as the Secretary of State for War was renamed). From 1824, the British Empire was divided by the War and Colonial Office into four administrative departments, including North America, the West Indies, Mediterranean and Africa, and Eastern Colonies, of which North America included:\nNorth America\n\nUpper Canada, Lower Canada\nNew Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island\nBermuda, Newfoundland\nThe Colonial Office and War Office, and the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Secretary of State for War, were separated in 1854, dividing the civil and military administration of the British Empire. The War Office, after 1854 and until the 1867 confederation of the Dominion of Canada, split the military administration of the British colonial and foreign stations into nine districts: North America and North Atlantic; West Indies; Mediterranean; West Coast of Africa and South Atlantic; South Africa; Egypt and The Sudan; Indian Ocean; Australasia; and China. North America and North Atlantic included the following stations (or garrisons):\nNorth America and North Atlantic\n\nNew Westminster (British Columbia)\nNewfoundland\nQuebec\nHalifax\nKingston, Canada West\nBermuda\nThe Atlantic archipelago of Bermuda (originally administered by the Virginia Company and, with The Bahamas, considered with North America prior to 1783), was grouped with the Maritime provinces from 1783 until formation of the Dominion of Canada in 1867, and thereafter generally with the colonies in the British West Indies (although the Church of England continued to place Bermuda under the Bishop of Newfoundland until 1919).\n\nFollowing the war, the Royal Navy spent a dozen years charting the barrier reef around Bermuda to discover the channel that enabled access to the northern lagoon, the Great Sound, and Hamilton Harbour. Once this had been located, a base was established (initially at St. George's before the construction of the Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda) in 1794, when Vice Admiral Sir George Murray, Commander-in-Chief of the new River St. Lawrence and Coast of America and North America and West Indies Station, set up the first Admiralty House, Bermuda at Rose Hill, St. George's. In 1813, the area of command became the North America Station again, with the West Indies falling under the Jamaica Station, and in 1816 it was renamed the North America and Lakes of Canada Station. The headquarters was initially in Bermuda during the winter and Halifax during the summer, but Bermuda, became the year-round headquarters of the Station in 1821, when the area of command became the North America and West Indies Station.  The Royal Naval Dockyard, Halifax was finally transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy in 1907. Bermuda and Halifax, Nova Scotia, along with Gibraltar and Malta would be designated Imperial fortresses.\nA British Army garrison was re-established at Bermuda in 1794 (a small regular infantry garrison had existed from 1701 to 1768, alongside the militia, and part of the Royal Garrison Battalion had been stationed there in 1778 but the battalion was disbanded there in 1784) and was expanded greatly during the 19th Century, both to defend the colony as a naval base and to launch amphibious operations against the Atlantic coast of the United States in any war that should transpire. Prior to 1784, the Bermuda Garrison had been placed under the military Commander-in-Chief America in New York during the American War of Independence, but was to become part of the Nova Scotia Command until the 1860s (in 1815, Lieutenant-General Sir George Prevost was Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief in and over the Provinces of Upper-Canada, Lower-Canada, Nova-Scotia, and New-Brunswick, and their several Dependencies, Vice-Admiral of the same, Lieutenant-General and Commander of all His Majesty's Forces in the said Provinces of Lower Canada and Upper-Canada, Nova-Scotia and New-Brunswick, and their several Dependencies, and in the islands of Newfoundland, Prince Edward, Cape Breton and the Bermudas, &c. &c. &c. Beneath Prevost, the staff of the British Army in the Provinces of Nova-Scotia, New-Brunswick, and their Dependencies, including the Islands of Newfoundland, Cape Breton, Prince Edward and Bermuda were under the Command of Lieutenant-General Sir John Coape Sherbrooke. Below Sherbrooke, the Bermuda Garrison was under the immediate control of the Lieutenant-Governor of Bermuda, Major-General George Horsford). The Royal Navy, British Army, Royal Marines, and Colonial Marines forces based in Bermuda carried out actions of this sort during the American War of 1812 (most notably the Burning of Washington in retribution for the \"wanton destruction of private property along the north shores of Lake Erie\" by American forces under Col. John Campbell in May 1814, the most notable being the Raid on Port Dover) to draw United States forces away from the Canadian border. In 1828, His Excellency George, Earl of Dalhousie, (Baron Dalhousie, of Dalhousie Castle,) Knight Grand Cross of the Most Honourable Military Order of the Bath was Captain General and Governor in Chief in and over the Provinces of Lower-Canada, Upper-Canada, Nova-Scotia, and New-Brunswick, and their several dependencies, Vice-Admiral of the same, Lieutenant-General and Commander of all His Majesty's Forces in the said Provinces, and their several dependencies, and in the Islands of Newfoundland, Prince Edward, and Bermuda, &c. &c c. &c. Beneath Dalhousie, the Provinces of Nova-Scotia, New-Brunswick, and their Dependencies, including the Island of Newfoundland, Cape Breton, Prince Edward and Bermuda were under the Command of His Excellency Lieutenant-General Sir James Kempt GCB, GCH.\nThe established Church of England in Bermuda (since 1978, titled the Anglican Church of Bermuda) and Newfoundland was attached to the See of Nova Scotia from 1825 to 1839 and from 1787 to 1839, respectively. From 1839, the island of Newfoundland and the coast of Labrador, as well as Bermuda, became parts of the Diocese of Newfoundland and Bermuda, with the shared Bishop (Aubrey George Spencer being the first) alternating his residence between the two colonies. A separate Bermuda Synod was incorporated in 1879, but continued to share its Bishop with Newfoundland until 1919, when the separate position of Bishop of Bermuda was created (in 1949, on Newfoundland becoming a province of Canada, the Diocese of Newfoundland became part of the Anglican Church of Canada; the Church of England in Bermuda, which was re-titled the Anglican Church of Bermuda in 1978, is today one of six extra-provincial Anglican churches within the  Church of England overseen by the Archbishop of Canterbury).\n\nWar of 1812\nIn the War of 1812, the Canadas were once again a battleground, this time between the British and the relatively young United States. During the war, unsuccessful attempts were made by the Americans to invade Upper Canada, after overestimating the amount of support they would receive from Canadian colonists. Much of the settler population of Upper Canada (now southern Ontario) were Americans who had very recently arrived in the colony, and some of them did support the invading force; however, the rest of the settler population was made up of the descendants of Loyalists or the original French colonists, who did not want to be part of the United States. The first American invasion came in October 1812, but they were defeated by General Isaac Brock at the Battle of Queenston Heights. The Americans invaded again in 1813, capturing Fort York (now Toronto). Later in the year, the Americans took control of the Great Lakes after the Battle of Lake Erie and the Battle of the Thames, but they had much less success in Lower Canada, where they were defeated at the Battle of Châteauguay and the Battle of Crysler's Farm. The Americans were driven out of Upper Canada in 1814 after the Battle of Lundy's Lane, although they still controlled the Great Lakes and defeated the British at the Battle of Lake Champlain. In English Canada, it is seen as a victory against American invasions, with heroic legends surrounding many of the participants (such as Isaac Brock and Laura Secord) and battles (especially those in the Niagara Peninsula).\n\nFur trade\nFor centuries one of the most important economic ventures in North America was the fur trade. This trade, which had been pioneered by the French, came to be dominated by the British as they gained increasing territory on the continent. The main British fur trading posts were located inside of what became the United States (the British were forced to relocate northward as borders were established with the new nation). First Nations were central to the trade as they were the primary fur trappers. The role gave the peoples of many of the First Nations a political voice as, though they were viewed as an underclass, they were too important to simply be ignored. The American Revolution led to intense competition between the British and the U.S. By the 1830s changing fashions in Europe had begun a steep decline in fur prices and an overall collapse in the market. Apart from the economic losses to whites involved in the fur trade, many of the First Nations were devastated, both in terms of economic loss and in terms of loss of influence in local politics.\n\nTimber trade\nAs the fur trade declined in importance, the timber trade became Canada's most important commodity. The industry became concentrated in three main regions. The first to be exploited was the Saint John River system. Trees in the still almost deserted hinterland of New Brunswick were cut and transported to Saint John where they were shipped to England. This area soon could not keep up with demand, and the trade moved to the St. Lawrence River where logs were shipped to Quebec City before being sent on to Europe. This area also became insufficient, and the trade expanded westward, most notably to the Ottawa River system, which by 1845 provided three quarters of the timber shipped from Quebec City. The timber trade became a massive business. In one summer 1200 ships were loaded with timber at Quebec City alone.\n\n\"Responsible government\" and the Rebellions of 1837–38\nAfter the War of 1812, the first half of the 19th century saw the growth of political reform movements in both Upper and Lower Canada, largely influenced by American and French republicanism. The colonial legislatures set out by the Constitutional Act had become dominated by wealthy elites, the Family Compact in Upper Canada and the Château Clique in Lower Canada. The moderate reformers, such as Robert Baldwin and Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine, argued for a more representational form of government which they called \"responsible government\".\nBy \"responsible,\" the reformers meant that such a government would be ultimately responsible to the will of the subjects of the colonies, not to authorities in London.  The critical move toward responsible government came between 1846 and 1850. In practice, it meant that the Executive Council of each colony formulated policy with the assistance of the legislative branch. The legislature voted approval or disapproval, and the appointed governor enacted those policies that it had approved. It was a transition from the older system when the governor took advice from an executive council, and use the legislature chiefly to raise money. The radical reformers, such as William Lyon Mackenzie and Louis-Joseph Papineau demanded equality or a complete break from British rule and the establishment of a republic.\nLouis-Joseph Papineau was elected speaker of the colonial assembly in 1815. His attempts at reform were ignored by the British, and in 1834, the assembly passed The Ninety-Two Resolutions, outlining its grievances against the legislative council. Papineau organized boycotts and civil disobedience. The colonial government illegally ordered the arrest of Papineau. The Patriotes resorted to armed resistance and planned the Lower Canada Rebellion in the fall of 1837. British troops in the colony quickly put down the rebellion and forced Papineau to flee to the United States. A second rebellion by the Frères chasseurs of Robert Nelson broke out one year later, but the British put it down as well, with much loss of life and destruction of property.\nWilliam Lyon Mackenzie, a Scottish immigrant and reformist mayor of York (Toronto), organized the Upper Canada Rebellion in December 1837 after the Patriotes rebellion had begun. Upper Canadians had similar grievances; they were annoyed at the undemocratic governance of the colony, and especially by the corrupt and inefficient Bank of Upper Canada and the Canada Company. On December 4, the rebels assembled near Montgomery's Tavern, where the British troops stationed in the city met them on December 7. The rebels were hopelessly outnumbered and outgunned and were defeated in less than an hour. Mackenzie escaped to the United States.\nAlso in December, a group of Irish immigrants attempted to seize southwestern Ontario by force in the Patriot War. They were defeated by government troops at Windsor.\n\nLord Durham's report\nLord Durham was appointed Governor General of Canada in 1838. He was assigned to investigate the causes of the Rebellions, and concluded that the problem was essentially animosity between the British and French inhabitants of Canada. His Report on the Affairs of British North America contains the famous description of \"two nations warring in the bosom of a single state.\" For Durham, the French Canadians were culturally backwards, and he was convinced that only a union of French and English Canada would allow the colony to progress in the interest of Great Britain. A political union would, he hoped, cause the French-speakers to be assimilated by English-speaking settlements, solving the problem of French Canadian nationalism once and for all.\n\nAct of Union (1840)\nLord Durham was succeeded by Lord Sydenham who was responsible for implementing Durham's recommendations in the Act of Union 1840 passed on July 23, 1840, by the Parliament of the United Kingdom and proclaimed February 10, 1841. Upper and Lower Canada became, respectively, Canada West and Canada East, both with 42 seats in the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada despite Lower Canada being more populated. The official language of the province became English and French was explicitly banned in the Parliament and in the courts.\n\nThe moderate reformers Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine and Robert Baldwin fought two successive governors general Sir Charles Bagot and Sir Charles Metcalfe to secure what became known as responsible government. Metcalfe fought to preserve the prerogatives of the Crown and the governor's control over the administration and patronage. He nonetheless had to make some concessions to win support, and the most notable of these was persuading the Colonial Office to grant amnesty to the rebels of 1837–38, and to abandon forced anglicization of the French-speaking population. Lafontaine and Baldwin reintroduced French as an official language alongside English in the Assembly, the Courts and other governmental bodies. Under the progressive Governor General James Bruce (Lord Elgin), a bill was passed to allow the leaders of former Patriote movement to return to their homeland; Papineau returned and for a short time re-entered Canadian politics. A similar bill was passed for the former Upper Canadian rebels. Elgin also implemented the practice of responsible government in 1848, several months after it had already been granted to the colony of Nova Scotia.\nThe parliament of United Canada in Montreal was set on fire by a mob of Tories in 1849 after the passing of an indemnity bill for the people who suffered losses during the rebellions of Lower Canada.\nOne noted achievement of the Union was the Canadian–American Reciprocity Treaty of 1855 which sanctioned free trade in resources. However, the achievement must be seen in the wider politics of British North America which had seen the major boundary disputes with the United States settled (see Rush–Bagot Treaty, Treaty of 1818, Webster–Ashburton Treaty, Oregon Treaty), thus easing tensions which for most of the first half of the 19th century had Americans threatening war or retaliation.\nThe Union Act of 1840 was ultimately unsuccessful, and led to calls for a greater political union in the 1850s and 1860s. Support for independence was strengthened by events such as the Battle of Ridgeway, an 1866 invasion into Ontario by some 1500 Irish nationalists which was repulsed largely by local militia.\n\nBritish colonies on the northwest coast\nAlthough Spain had taken the lead in the exploration of the northwest Pacific Coast, with the voyages of Juan José Pérez Hernández in 1774 and 1775, by the time the Spanish determined to build a fort on Vancouver Island, the British navigator James Cook had himself visited Nootka Sound and charted the coast as far as Alaska, while British and American traders had begun settling on the coast so as to develop resources for trade with Europe and Asia. In 1793, Alexander Mackenzie a Scotsman working for the North West Company crossed the continent and with his aboriginal guides, French-Canadian voyageurs and another Scot, reached the mouth of the Bella Coola River, completing the first continental crossing of North America north of Mexico, missing George Vancouver's charting expedition to the region by only a few weeks. The competing imperial claims between Russia, Spain and Britain were compounded by treaties between the former two powers and the United States, which pressed for the annexation of most of what is now British Columbia, not recognizing the title of the many First Nations present.\nWith the signing of the Oregon Treaty in 1846, the United States agreed to establish its northern border with western British North America along the 49th parallel. By 1857, Americans and British were beginning to respond to rumours of gold in the Fraser River area. Almost overnight, some ten to twenty thousand men moved into the region around present-day Yale, British Columbia, sparking the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush. Governor James Douglas was suddenly faced with having to exert British authority over a largely alien population. In order to normalize its jurisdiction, and undercut any Hudsons's Bay Company claims to the resource wealth of the mainland, the Crown colony of British Columbia was established August 2, 1858. Douglas signed a few treaties with the First Nations on Vancouver Island, but did not otherwise recognize the First Nations of the colony. In 1866, it was united with the Colony of Vancouver Island into the united Colony of British Columbia.\nBy the mid-1850s, politicians in the Province of Canada began to contemplate western expansion. They questioned the Hudson's Bay Company's tenure of Rupert's Land and the Arctic territories, and launched a series of exploring expeditions to familiarize themselves and the settler population with the geography and climate of the region.\n\nTrade with the United States\nIn 1854, the Governor General of British North America, Lord Elgin, signed a significant trade agreement with the United States on behalf of the colonies. This agreement endured for ten years until the American government abrogated it in 1865.\n\nConfederation\nEffective governance of the Province of Canada after 1840 required a careful balancing of the interests of French and English- speaking populations; and between Catholics and Protestants. John A. Macdonald emerged in the 1850s as a personality who could manage that task. A political conservative, MacDonald forged political relationships and coalitions with George-Étienne Cartier, the leader of powerful French Canadian bleus, and George Brown of the more stridently reformist English-Canadian and anti-French \"Grits\". MacDonald came to realize that Canada's likeliest hope of resisting absorption into the United States was to reform itself into a workable federation. A delegation from the Canadas made its way to a conference being held in Charlottetown in 1864 by representatives from the Maritimes who had intended to hold discussions regarding a federation of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. This conference was followed by a subsequent conference in Quebec City. The Seventy-Two Resolutions from the 1864 Quebec Conference laid out the framework for uniting British colonies in North America into a federation. They were adopted by the majority of the provinces of Canada and became the basis for the London Conference of 1866, which led to the formation of the Dominion of Canada on July 1, 1867. Federation emerged from multiple impulses: the British wanted Canada to defend itself; the Maritimes needed railroad connections, which were promised in 1867; British-Canadian nationalism sought to unite the lands into one country, dominated by the English language and British culture; many French-Canadians saw an opportunity to exert political control within a new largely French-speaking Quebec. Finally, but by no means least significant, were fears of possible U.S. expansion northward in the wake of the end of the United States Civil War. On a political level, there was a desire for the expansion of responsible government and elimination of the legislative deadlock between Upper and Lower Canada, and their replacement with provincial legislatures in a federation. This was especially pushed by the liberal Reform movement of Upper Canada and the French-Canadian rouges in Lower Canada who favoured a decentralized union in comparison to the Upper Canadian Conservative party and to some degree the French-Canadian bleus which favoured a centralized union. Even Queen Victoria was supportive, noting \"...the impossibility of our being able to hold Canada, but we must struggle for it; and by far the best solution would be to let it go as an independent kingdom under an English prince.\" In the end Canada went as a Dominion under the Crown of the United Kingdom itself. It was a fresh start, but not one that was greeted with universal joy. While some envisaged Confederation for the British North American colonies as a way forward together, La Minerve, a newspaper in the new Province of Quebec endorsed the federation because it provided \"la seule voie qui nous soit offerte pour arriver à l'indépendance politique.\" (\"the only way offered to us to achieve political independence\"). A change of heart toward Confederation was evident in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where the Morning Chronicle newspaper announced on the front page of its July 1, 1867, edition the death of \"the free and enlightened Province of Nova Scotia\".\n\nSee also\nHeritage Minutes\nHistory of Canada\nFormer colonies and territories in Canada\n\nReferences\nSources\nCruikshank, Ernest (2006) [1814].

    "title": "Right to privacy in New Zealand",
    "text": "New Zealand is committed to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and has ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, both of which contain a right to privacy. Privacy law in New Zealand is dealt with by statute and the common law. The Privacy Act 2020 addresses the collection, storage and handling of information.  A general right to privacy has otherwise been created in the tort of privacy. Such a right was recognised in Hosking v Runting [2003] 3 NZLR 385, a case that dealt with publication of private facts. In the subsequent case C v Holland [2012] NZHC 2155 the Court recognised a right to privacy in the sense of seclusion or a right to be free from unwanted intrusion.\n\nLegislation\nNew Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990\nThe New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 (NZBORA) is based on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, however no express right to privacy is included in the Act. Despite the lack of an express right, privacy is the foundation for many of the rights contained within NZBORA, such as freedom from unreasonable search and seizure as protected by section 21. The fact that a right to privacy is not included in NZBORA does not affect or invalidate it in any way. It is suggested that privacy was not included in NZBORA due to its difficulty to define, and because the social environment at the time was not one in which it was appropriate to implement a right with vague and uncertain parameters.\n\nPrivacy Act 2020\nNew Zealand has a statute entitled the Privacy Act 2020 (which replaced the Privacy Act 1993). However, despite its declaration that it is an Act to promote and protect individual privacy, it in fact only covers information privacy. The Privacy Act was created to combat concerns about technological advances and their potential to be used to access private information, when this risk had been far less under manual data systems.\nThe Act contains 13 Information Privacy Principles which govern the handling of private information by agencies. An 'agency' is widely defined as any person or body of persons, whether public or private, and whether corporate or unincorporated, with specified exceptions. There are also numerous exceptions to the Information Privacy Principles, which can be found both within the principles and in other places within the Act.\nWhen an individual feels there has been a breach of the principles he or she can lodge a complaint with the Privacy Commissioner. The Privacy Commissioner investigates the complaint and undertakes a process of conciliation rather than punishment. If the complaint cannot be settled, it may be referred to the Human Rights Review Tribunal, which may or may not consider the situation anew, and it's quite likely that they won't consider a complaint at all (especially if the issue is related to debt). If the Tribunal finds there has been a breach, it may award a range of remedies including damages and restraining orders.\nThe Privacy Act recognises that privacy is not an absolute concept and that there are other factors which need to be weighed to determine what the outcome should be. The Privacy Commissioner must always have regard to factors such as human rights, social interests, and international obligations and guidelines. The Privacy Commissioner is able to make authorisations regarding the use of private information which would normally be contrary to the Act if he or she is satisfied that the public interest or benefit outweighs the interference with privacy.\n\nBroadcasting Act 1989\nThe Broadcasting Act 1989 requires broadcasters to maintain standards consistent with the privacy of the individual. The Act establishes the Broadcasting Standards Authority (BSA), which has the functions of receiving and deciding complaints against broadcasters, issuing opinions relating to ethical conduct and standards in broadcasting, and issuing codes of practice for broadcasters and encouraging compliance with them. Privacy is consistently mentioned in the codes and standards of practice issues by the BSA. While the Broadcasting Act does not provide any explanation of what constitutes a breach of privacy, the BSA has seven principles relating to alleged breaches of privacy. In considering a complaint, the BSA can award a variety of remedies if it finds there has been a breach, but there is no ability to take a complaint to a court of law based on the standards contained within the Act.\n\nCommon law\nA general tort of invasion of privacy exists in New Zealand. The case which is accepted to be the first which found that a tort of privacy may exist was Tucker v News Media Ownership Ltd, in which the judge supported the introduction of such a tort into the law of New Zealand. A few years later in \nBradley v Wingnut Films, the judge accepted that a tort of privacy did exist in New Zealand law, but that it should be approached with caution as it was in the earlier stages of development. The most crucial New Zealand High Court decision was that of P and D v Independent News Auckland Ltd, where the court defined the elements of a tort of privacy as:\n\nThe public disclosure of facts\nThe facts disclosed are of a private nature\nThe facts made public would be considered highly offensive to a reasonable person\nThere is insufficient legitimate public concern in having the facts made public.\nThe New Zealand Court of Appeal in a bare majority in Hosking v Runting accepted that there was a tort of privacy in New Zealand. The tort was affirmed as protection in this area was needed and the breach of confidence tort was not suitable to cover situations involving privacy. The two requirements for the tort set out by the majority closely reflect those set out in P v D:\n\nExistence of facts which were reasonably expected to be private\nPublicity given to those facts which would be considered highly offensive by the objective and reasonable person.\nIn addition, privacy had to be weighed against the defence of legitimate public concern which encompasses the right to freedom of expression.\nThe Supreme Court of New Zealand has in one case accepted that a tort of privacy exists for the purposes of a case before it, but had differing opinions about its requirements and application. In Brooker v Police the court acknowledged the decision of Hosking but refrained from commenting.\n\nSecurity and intelligence\nNew Zealand’s intelligence and security agencies\nTwo government bodies are responsible for monitoring New Zealand's national security: the Government Communications Security Bureau (the 'GCSB') and the Security Intelligence Service (the 'SIS'). Prior to the introduction of the Intelligence and Security Act 2017, these bodies operated strictly independently of one another, and general mystery surrounded their exact functions and capabilities. Much of the confusion originated from the fact that the SIS and GCSB appeared to have differing objectives which meant that, if required, co-operation and coordination would likely be complex and convoluted.\nFor example, only the SIS could perform surveillance, or spy, on New Zealanders, as provided by the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service Act 1969. There were stipulations as to what 'spy-activities' were permitted, and as a pre-requisite, any proposed surveillance had to be relevant to \"security\" and its associated threats, such as instances of 'espionage, sabotage, subversion or terrorist attacks'.\n\nThe 2013 surveillance landscape\nIn September 2012, Paul Neazor, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security advised John Key, the then New Zealand Prime Minister, of a situation which would later be called an \"unlawful interception\" of an individual known as Kim Dotcom by the GCSB. Following a formal request from the United States' Federal Bureau of Investigation that Kim Dotcom be extradited to the United States, the GCSB spied on Mr Dotcom in order to assist the FBI's request. However, as the GCSB did not have the legal authority to conduct surveillance, Justice Gilbert of the Court of Appeal, deemed unlawful.\nFollowing this widely publicised incident, GCSB Director Ian Fletcher and Chief Executive of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet Andrew Kibblewhite initiated a review of compliance. They assigned the then Cabinet Secretary Rebecca Kitteridge with undertaking the review to look into the \"activities, systems and processes since 1 April 2003\". This date is significant as it was the date from which the Government Communications Security Bureau Act 2003 came into force.\n\nThe “Kitteridge Report” ultimately concluded that GCSB lacked the legal basis and authority to perform many of its intelligence acts – including the surveillance carried out on Kim Dotcom. The Kitteridge Report made a number of recommendations to ensure that the Government agency had the legal authority to do the activities necessary. All of the recommendations presented in the Kitteridge Report were accepted by the Government and GCSB which led to a number of legislative reforms. These included giving the GCSB the express capability to legally perform surveillance on New Zealanders when required by the SIS, the police or Defence forces. At the time when these changes were introduced, with mounting public concern about New Zealanders' rights to privacy, the then Prime Minister John Key stated that the \"new legislation does not add up to an expansion of the bureau’s powers\".\nIt is now permissible for GCSB to legally spy on New Zealanders as a result of the 2013 reforms. In addition, the GCSB's role has expanded and it is now able to perform surveillance on \"behalf of the SIS, the police or the Defence forces, or for the purposes of cyber security\".\n\nThe 2016 surveillance landscape\nIn August 2016 the then Prime Minister John Key announced that due to the threat of ISIS and global terrorism, the New Zealand Government would be introducing new legislation to provide further safeguards for New Zealanders.\nNew Zealand's first Intelligence and Security Review was undertaken by Sir Michael Cullen and Dame Patsy Reddy, and looked at \"the legislative framework governing the agencies and considered whether they were well placed to protect New Zealand’s current and future national security while protecting individual rights\". The review was completed at the end of February 2016, and its findings proposed that one Act be introduced to bring all of New Zealand's intelligence and security agencies together.\nCullen and Reddy identified a number of issues in their report.  One of the prominent issues identified was that the fragmented legislative landscape meant that it was difficult to bring the multiple agencies together when required.  Because each intelligence and security agency operated under its own legislative framework, it was confusing for New Zealanders to understand which agency was responsible for what, and exactly what their lawful powers and capabilities were.\nThe reviewers concluded that a \"single Act\" was necessary to overcome these issues. They commented that a single Act would:\n\n\"give a comprehensive and much clearer view of the agencies' functions and powers, and the checks and balances that apply to the operation of their powers … [and] would avoid inconsistencies and gaps between various statutes and enable a consistent set of fundamental principles to be applied to the agencies and their oversight\". \nUnderstandably, drawing the two bodies together would make it easier for them to co-operate and work together when required.\nAnother issue concerning to the reviewers was the lack of security protection available to New Zealanders under the prevailing legislation. The most recent piece of legislation dealing with intelligence and surveillance was enacted some 47 years ago, the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service Act 1969. Over the course of those years and the accompanying advances in technology, the need to overhaul the law has increased markedly. As terrorist groups continue to advance in their technological capabilities, the current legislation was quickly becoming out-dated and unsuitable for present day society.\n\nThe Intelligence and Security Act 2017\nThe purpose of the Intelligence and Security Act 2017 was to bring clarity and cohesion to the GCSB and SIS, the two agencies in New Zealand responsible for monitoring the country's security and intelligence.\nThe Act was \"a direct response to the report of the First Independent Review of Intelligence and Security in New Zealand: Intelligence and Security in a Free Society, and it replaces the four Acts that applied to the GCSB, the NZSIS, and their oversight bodies\".\nGiven the importance of this proposed legislation, when public submissions for the Bill were called for, 92 were received by the Select Committee. These included submissions made by the New Zealand Law Society, the New Zealand Human Rights Commissioner, and the Privacy Commissioner and many of their recommendations were similar in nature expressing concern over the words used to draft the Bill making the powers of the bodies uncertain, and also the potential for ordinary New Zealanders' privacy rights to be breached.\nAlthough the Act intended to give oversight and transparency to the New Zealand intelligence and security agencies, the Act was drafted in a manner that gave far-reaching powers to the GCSB and SIS to perform surveillance on New Zealand citizens and non-residents in ways that had previously been prohibited. The basis for doing so was that New Zealand's national security is at stake with the ever-present and increased risk of terrorism in today's society.\nThe new Act has extended the GCSB's capabilities to perform surveillance on New Zealanders, whereas previously, only the SIS was permitted do this. This extension of the GCSB's powers has the potential to have serious ramifications for all New Zealanders, as author and associate professor of law Stephen Penk notes, \"surveillance of an individual may lead to a loss of privacy through an individual’s loss of control or autonomy when, typically, he or she is subjected to undesired monitoring of his or her functions, movements or communications\"\nAs per the recommendations made by Cullen and Reddy the new Act covers a number of points such as:\n\nBringing the GCSB and SIS together under a single Act for the purpose of achieving co-operation between the agencies.\nClarifying the rules regarding monitoring, gathering, and storing of human intelligence.\nMaking the SIS and the GCSB state-sector government departments, and therefore requiring them to comply with all regulations governing state-section government bodies.\nThe Act's purpose was expressed in Section 3; which is to \"protect New Zealand as a free, open, and democratic society\". This is achieved by:\n\nPart 2 of the Act \"continues the SIS and the GCSB\" but clarifies that they will remain two separate agencies with differences in capabilities and methods. Although Part 2 makes note of these differences, they will continue to have shared objectives and functions under a \"joint warranting\" framework.\nIn response to concerns that this proposed legislation interferes with New Zealanders' human rights, Part 2 provides a number of safeguards. One such safeguard is expressed in sections 12 and 13 that \"require that the agencies operate in accordance with New Zealand law and all human rights obligations, including when co-operating or sharing intelligence with foreign partners\". These sections were a direct recommendation of the Human Rights Commission to ensure that New Zealand complies with its international and domestic human rights obligations.\nSection 22 of the Act provided a further safeguard extending protection to \"the right to engage in lawful advocacy, protest and dissent\". This is an important and long-standing human right that ought to be protected. The right to freedom of expression is enshrined in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, with section 14 stating that \"everyone has the right to freedom of expression, including the freedom to seek, receive and impart information and opinions of any kind in any form\". The right has also been expressed in many other human rights instruments, such as Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which also upholds this right. It is also reflected in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: \"Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers\".\n\nFuture directions\nIn dissenting judgments in the 2007 case Brooker v Police, two judges of the Supreme Court of New Zealand voiced their support for the strengthening of privacy rights in New Zealand. McGrath J outlined the international and domestic recognition of the right to privacy, concluded that privacy is close to matching the strength given to the right to freedom of expression, and used the privacy interests of an individual concerned in the case as the main reason for his conclusion and dissent. Thomas J explicitly stated his support for privacy to be given the status of a right, and reasoned his support by citing the NZBORA, international instruments, judicial decisions and social attitudes.\nIn August 2011, the New Zealand Law Commission released the fourth and final part to a detailed inquiry into the state of New Zealand's privacy laws. The four parts discuss the concept of privacy, public registers, the invasion of privacy in both civil and criminal contexts, and the Privacy Act 1993. The Commission recommends a range of changes be made to the law, such as the creation of a Do Not Call register and better protection of online information. Some of these recommendations are currently tabled before Parliament, while others are currently awaiting a response from the government.\nIn March 2018, Minister of Justice Andrew Little introduced the Privacy Bill to amend the Privacy Act 1993. The Bill will repeal and replace the current Act and make various changes, including strengthening powers for the Privacy Commissioner, introducing mandatory reporting of privacy breaches, creating new offences and increasing fines.\n\nSee also\nCredit Reporting Privacy Code\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\nThe Office of the Privacy Commissioner\nBroadcasting Standards Authority\nNew Zealand Law Commission: Review of the Law of Privacy\nPrivacy Act 1993\nBroadcasting Standards Act 1989\nNew Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990",

    "title": "Domra",
    "text": "The domra (Russian: домра, Russian pronunciation: [ˈdɔmrɑ], pl. домры, domry) is a long-necked Russian folk string instrument of the lute family. It has a round body and three or four metal strings.\n\nName\nAccording to A. S. Famintsyn, domra is the russified form of Arabic tanbura.\n\nHistory\nThe first known written mention of the domra is in Admonitions of Metropolitan Daniel (1530). This musical instrument gained great popularity in the 16th–17th centuries, replacing the gusli. There are numerous mentions of the domra in historic documents of this period. For instance, Alphabet (1654), in the Moscow Synodal Library, says: \"As to what musikiia is: Musikiia, playing, that is, the sounding of gusli and kiniry, or lyres, and domry, and similar things\". \nIn addition, medieval Russian illuminated manuscripts of the Psalter contain images of musicians with necked plucked-string instruments, and some of those miniatures are clearly captioned \"depiction of domras\". Judging by those images, late medieval Russian domry can be divided into two types: lute-shaped, which had five to six strings, a large body and а pegbox angled back, and tanbur-shaped, which had three to four strings, a small body and a straight pegbox.\nAfter the pious Tsar Alexis of Russia issued an edict ordering the persecution of Russian folk musicians and destruction of their instruments (1648), the domra gradually came into disuse and was replaced by the balalaika, which was much easier to make and play. According to the edict:\n\nWhenever domras appear, they should be confiscated and, after those objects of demonic games are broken, burned. And people who play them should be beaten and sent to the end of our state.\nIn 1896, a student of Vasily Vasilievich Andreyev found a broken instrument in a stable in rural Russia. It was thought that this instrument may have been an example of a domra, although at that time no illustrations or examples of the traditional domra were known to exist (the traditional domra was only known through numerous mentions in folklore, though examples existed of the dombra, a related Turkic instrument). A three-stringed version of this instrument was later redesigned in 1896, patented, and introduced into the orchestra of Russian folk instruments.\n\nOrchestral instruments\nThe basic domra is tuned as follows:\n\nThree strings: EAD tuning.\nFour strings: GDAE tuning (like the mandolin or the violin)\nInstruments are made in various sizes including piccolo, prima, alto, tenor, bass, and contrabass.\n\nPiccolo: b1 e2 a2\nPrima: e1 a1 d2\nMezzo-Soprano: b e1 a1\nAlto: e a d1\nTenor: B e a\nBass: E A d\nContrabass (minor): 1E 1A D\nContrabass (major): 1A D G\n\nPerformers\nTamara Volskaya is considered to be one of the leading contemporary performers on the domra.\nAleksandr Tsygankov is considered to be one of the leading contemporary performers, teachers, and composers of the 3 string domra.\n\nSee also\nBalalaika\nMandolin\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nFindeizen, Nikolai (7 February 2008).

    "title": "Plying",
    "text": "In the textile arts, plying (from the French verb plier, \"to fold\", from the Latin verb plico, from the ancient Greek verb πλέκω.) is a process of twisting one or more strings (called strands or plies) of yarn together to create a stronger yarn. Strands are twisted together in the direction opposite that in which they were spun. Plied yarns will not unravel, break, or degrade as easily as unplied yarns. When enough twist is added to the plies to counter the initial twist of each strand, the resulting yarn is \"balanced\", having no tendency to twist upon itself. \nThe number of strands used to make the yarn is usually the same as the number of plies it has. Two-ply yarn means two strands were used, three-ply yarn means three strands were used, etc. Embroidery floss is generally a six-ply yarn, for example. There are some exceptions to this, most notably in chain plying.\n\nPlying handspun yarns\nThere are two common ways to ply a balanced yarn: regular and chain plying. \nBoth methods involve the manipulation of \"singles\"—unplied strands on their own—into multiple-ply yarns by applying twist in the opposite direction than how the single was spun. For example, if in spinning the single the wheel was spinning clockwise (called a \"Z\" twist, as on any given side the fibres appear to cross each other like the line in the middle of the letter \"Z\"), the wheel must spin counter-clockwise (an \"S\" twist) in order to ply it.\n\nRegular plying\nRegular plying consists of taking 2 or more singles and twisting them together. This can be done on either a spinning wheel or a spindle.\n\nWhen plying, the singles are kept separate, either with the fingers or with a tool. This tool can be anything from the top of a salt dispenser, and the singles threaded through the holes, or a specially carved piece of wood with holes in it. The singles are kept separate to ensure that they do not get tangled and so the tension can be controlled.\nMost spinners who use spinning wheels ply from bobbins or spools. This is easier than plying from balls because there is less chance for the yarn to become tangled and knotted. So that the bobbins can unwind freely, they are put in a device called a Lazy Kate, or sometimes simply kate. The simplest lazy kate consists of wooden bars with a metal rod running between them. Most hold three or four bobbins. The bobbin sits on the metal rod. Other lazy kates are built with devices that create an adjustable amount of tension, which adds control to how much string is unwound using a given amount of force. Some spinning wheels come with a built-in lazy kate. \nOn a drop spindle, two-ply is created by placing the spools on a lazy kate, tying the ends together onto the drop spindle, holding equal lengths of singles together and dropping the spindle. The weight of the drop spindle, combined with the twist in the singles, causes the drop spindle to turn in the opposite direction that the singles were twisted in until the two singles are plied together.\n\nChain plying\nChain plying (also known as Navajo plying) consists of making large loops, similar to crocheting. Only one single is necessary, and if the single is already dyed, this technique allows it to be plied without changing the color scheme. \nThe spinner first makes a loop on the end of the leader—the string left on the bobbin, which the new yarn is spun from—that is large enough to slip their hand through. They pull some of the working yarn through the loop. Then the spinner starts applying twist to the three plies, consisting of the two sides of the loop together with the yarn pulled through it. When the loop and the yarn are nearly fully plied together, a new loop of yarn is pulled through the initial loop, and spinning continues. This process is repeated until the yarn is all plied. This technique allows the spinner to try to match up thick and thin spots in the yarn, thus making for a smoother end product.\n\nCenter-pull ball plying\nCenter-pull ball plying results in yarn similar in appearance to regular plying. However, it doesn’t require a lazy kate or multiple bobbins. It requires a single bobbin and a center-pull ball winder or a nostepinne to create the center-pull ball that is plied with.\nOnce the ball is wound, the single from both the center and outside are held together, in a similar manner to the regular plying method, then twisted together. This results in a two-ply yarn.\nCenter-pull ball plying results in one single being more tightly wound than the other, causing a fluffier and looser texture when knit, compared to the regular plying method.\n\nMachined yarns\nMachines that ply yarn use the 'regular' method mentioned above. The main difference is that gears control the intake, making sure that the strands all have the same tension and the same length. Other than that, the process for plying is exactly the same as when hand done.\n\nNovelty yarns\nMany novelty yarns make use of special plying techniques to gain their special effects. By varying the tension in the strands, or the relative sizes of the strands, or many other factors different effects can be achieved. For example, when a soft, thick strand is plied against a tightly twisted thin strand, the resulting yarn spirals. Another example is bouclé, which is a yarn where one strand is held loosely and allowed to make loops on the other yarn while plying.\n\nSee also\nRope\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nAbby Franquemont, Respect the Spindle, spin infinite yarns with one amazing tool, Interweave (2009) ISBN 9781596681552, pp100–111.\n\n\n== External links ==",

    "text": "Mstrkrft (stylized as MSTRKRFT; disemvowelment of \"master craft\") is a Canadian electronic music duo from Toronto. The group was started in 2005 by Jesse F. Keeler of Death from Above and Al-P (Alex Puodziukas) formerly of the Mississauga, Ontario electropop group Girlsareshort. Al-P was also the producer for Death from Above's 1979 album You're a Woman, I'm a Machine as well as several of (Keeler's former band) Black Cat #13's records. The duo have been close friends, as well as work partners, for a long time. Mstrkrft also produced Die Mannequin's first EP, How to Kill, and Magneta Lane's second LP, Dancing With Daggers.\nMstrkrft has been commissioned to remix songs by such artists as Death From Above 1979, Justice, Kylie Minogue, Katy Perry, Bloc Party, Ayumi Hamasaki, Metric, Wolfmother, Annie, and The Kills.\n\nHistory\nPrior to forming MSTRKRFT, Al-P and Keeler collaborated in the late 1990s, then lived in different cities as Al-P moved to New York and worked at the studios Sound on Sound and Chung King, and did some recording for Jay-Z and Wyclef Jean. Al-P was later in the electronic pop group Girlsareshort, with friend Daniel Zabawa. They released two albums, Contactkiss in 2002 and Earlynorthamerican in 2003, before disbanding. Al-P produced for Black Cat 13, Death from Above's album You're a Woman, I'm a Machine and The Sick Lipstick's Sting Sting Sting.\nThe band took out the vowels from their name in order to avoid trademark infringement with Mastercraft, a Canadian tools company. The 'C' was changed to a 'K' in order to maintain the pronunciation and image of the original name. Their first single was \"Easy Love\", released in 2006 on Last Gang Records. They released their second single, \"Work On You\", on 6 July. In contrast to the \"Easy Love\" music video, \"Work On You\" featured animated robots, similar to those found in classic cartoons (similar to Voltron and Transformers). The band has created remixes from a variety of other artists, ranging from Buck 65 to The Kills to Death from Above 1979.\nMstrkrft released their debut album, The Looks, on 18 July 2006 in the United States and 2 February 2007 in Britain. Keeler and Al-P told Eye Weekly weeks before the release of The Looks, that as the album was being finished, the planning stages for a follow-up record had already begun. Describing the upcoming album's new direction, Al-P said that the album would be \"darker, underground disco and house with elements of American rock music.\"\nThe 2007 version of their song \"Street Justice\" was also released as a single. On the band's website message board, Keeler mentioned they were also working on a compilation album composed of their remixed tracks. \"Street Justice\" was also featured in Saints Row 2. \"Neon Knights\" was also featured on Need For Speed: Pro Street, their remix for Justice's \"D.A.N.C.E.\" was featured in the film Meet the Spartans, and \"Work on You\" was featured in Dirt 2. Their song \"Paris\" was featured in a 2006 commercial for the online music store URGE. In 2007, Mstrkrft appeared at the WEMF World Electronic Music Festival. In September 2007, Mstrkrft performed at an Australian spring music festival \"Parklife\" in Brisbane. They performed their remix of the song \"Woman\" from Modular label mates Wolfmother. Andrew Stockdale of Wolfmother appeared on stage and sang live while Mstrkrft performed the remix.\nIn 2008, they released a mix CD with Z-Trip through Obeygiant.com. In conjunction with this CD, Obey offered the Artwork print, entitled Soundclash of the Titans. On 24 May 2008, Mstrkrft was featured on BBC Radio 1 show, The Essential Mix. Mstrkrft later performed at the 2008 Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival, which included a diverse group of artists ranging from Metallica to Jack Johnson. In 2009, their remix of \"Woman\" by Wolfmother was featured in the film Lesbian Vampire Killers. On 17 March 2009, Mstrkrft released their second LP, Fist of God. Initial critical response was average, with major periodicals Spin, Rolling Stone, and Blender giving the album less-than-stellar reviews. The album features guest appearances by John Legend, E-40, N.O.R.E., and Lil' Mo, among others. In 2010, their song “Bounce’ featuring N.O.R.E. was featured in DJ Hero 2.\nIn 2011, they released two new singles, \"Beards Again\" and \"Back in the USSA\". \"Beards Again\" was later featured on the Injustice: Gods Among Us video game soundtrack in 2013. The band's third LP, Operator was released on 22 July 2016. The singles \"Little Red Hen\" and \"Party Line\" were released in March and May 2016 respectively to promote the album. Starting in May 2019, MSTRKRFT started releasing a single every month on ORO Records, including \"City Violence\", \"La Chiaccherona\", \"All Night, All Night\", \"Buffalo Fat\", and \"Dorsia\".\n\nDiscography\nAlbums\nEPs\nSingles\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website",

    "title": "Cercis occidentalis",
    "text": "Cercis occidentalis, the western redbud or California redbud (syn. Cercis orbiculata — Greene), is a small tree or shrub in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is found primarily in Northern California, with other populations in parts of Utah and Arizona.\nIt is easily recognized when it is in bloom from March to May, when it is covered with small pink to purple flowers.\n\nDescription\nCercis occidentalis is a deciduous shrub to small tree, growing up to 7 metres (23 ft) tall. The largest individual is in Santa Rosa and is 8.8 metres (29 ft) high. Its crown is rounded on clustered, erect branches to a width of 10–20 feet (3.0–6.1 m). The branches are thin, shiny, and brown. Twigs are slender, erect, and hairless.\nThe leaves are arranged alternately along the twigs and are simple, round, and slightly leathery, growing to 5–9 centimetres (2.0–3.5 in) in diameter, with 12–25-millimetre (0.47–0.98 in) petioles. They have heart shaped bases with entire margins. Leaves have 7 to 9 fan-like veins. The upper surfaces of the leaves are dark green, shiny, and hairless, while their lower surfaces are green and hairless. They start as light green early in the season and darken as they age; on plants at higher elevation, leaves may turn gold or red as the weather cools.\nInflorescences are unbranched and showy with bright pink or magenta flowers. Flowers, described as similar to pea flowers, measure about 12 millimetres (0.47 in) long and appear before leaves emerge. They grow in clusters all over the shrub, making the plant very colorful and noticeable in the landscape. The fruits are legume pods, 4–7.5 centimetres (1.6–3.0 in) long and about 12 millimetres (0.47 in) wide, thin and dry, and brown or reddish-purple. The clustered pods persist through winter.\nIt is an abundant seeder and seeds have a high rate of germination. It endures shade in early life and light shade when mature; shade tolerance appears to be greater with increased soil moisture.\nThe wood is fine-grained, dark yellowish brown, with a thin layer of whitish sapwood.\nCompared to the more commonly cultivated Cercis canadensis, it has more rounded leaves and tends to grow as a small shrub rather than a tree, although it does commonly grow as larger trees up to 25 feet tall, particularly in natural settings.\n\nHabitat\nIts native habitats include foothill woodlands and chaparrals; they grow near stream banks in dry foothills and lower canyon slopes below 1,100 metres (3,600 ft). It grows frequently in crevices and pockets where seeds are well covered with mineral soil.\n\nEcology\nCercis occidentalis flowers bloom in spring from February to April. As is the case with other legumes, it is a nitrogen-fixing plant because of the presence of root nodules, allowing symbiotic bacteria to produce nitrogen. They grow singly and in shrubby clumps alongside California buckeye, ceanothus, manzanita, and other chaparral brush.\nIt is noted for attracting birds and other wildlife. The leaves are harvested by native leafcutter bees and the flowers are an important nectar and pollen source for native insects and hummingbirds.\nIt can be susceptible to occasional tent caterpillar infestations, but these can be controlled. It is also known to be susceptible to other caterpillars as well as crown rot, phytophthora, root rot, and scales. It is resistant to oak root fungus and armillaria.\n\nUses\nIndigenous Californians use the twigs of the western redbud to weave baskets, and even prune the shrub to encourage growth of new twigs. \nIt has been described as being worthy of notice for foresters only because of their use in \"forming a scanty cover along dry, rocky borders of streams,\" and the wood has been described as being of no economic or domestic use.\n\nCultivation\nCercis occidentalis is cultivated as an ornamental plant and tree, for planting in parks and gardens, and as a street tree. It is also used in drought tolerant, native plant, and wildlife gardens. It is also used as a screen tree.\n\nCultural significance\nCercis occidentalis is important to the ethnobotany of multiple native groups, being used in basketry, and has different names in their respective languages. Botanist Victor King Chestnut gave the name for the tree in various north California indigenous languages; according to him, the Yuki call the tree Chā'ā, the Koncow call it dop or tal'k, the Ukiah (cited as Yokia) call it Kälā' ä kälã', and it is called Mūlā' in Northern Pomo.\n\nImages\nReferences\nBibliography\nCasebeer, M.

    "title": "African striped weasel",
    "text": "The African striped weasel (Poecilogale albinucha), also known as the white-naped weasel, striped weasel or African weasel, is a small mammal native to sub-Saharan Africa, where its range stretches from as far north as Kenya south to South Africa. It is in the family Mustelidae and is the lone member of the genus Poecilogale. It has a long, slender body with short legs and a bushy tail. One of the smallest carnivorans in Africa, it measures 24 to 35 cm (9.4 to 13.8 in) long excluding the tail, with males generally larger than females. It has black fur over most of its body, with distinctive white bands running from the top of its head down its back, with the tail being completely white. The closest living relative of this species is the striped polecat, and it may also be related to the extinct Propoecilogale bolti.\nThe African striped weasel is most commonly seen in savanna and veld grasslands with termite mounds, but has also been recorded in semideserts, rainforests, fynbos and even areas used by humans such as pine plantations and agricultural land. It is a powerful digger and excavates burrows which it inhabits. Though not commonly seen, it has been listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because of its wide range and habitat tolerance. There are no known major threats to the species, though it is commonly used in local traditional medicine. Owls and domestic dogs are known to prey on it, and weasels sometimes die in fights against each other. This weasel generally flees from any perceived threats, but may try warding off its attacker with noises, fake charges or a noxious fluid sprayed from its perineal glands.\nAfrican striped weasels are specialized predators that feed almost entirely on rodents, though they occasionally eat birds as well. Even when hungry, they ignore other types of small animals and eggs provided to it as food. This animal commonly bites its prey in the back of the neck while rolling around or kicking the prey's back, likely in an attempt to dislocate the neck. Larger prey may instead be dispatched with bites to the throat, though only females have been observed doing this. This weasel rarely drinks water, only doing so in small quantities when the weather is hot. It is mostly a nocturnal and solitary animal, though small groups of up to four individuals are sometimes seen. Breeding takes place from spring to the end of summer, and two to three young tend to be born per litter after a gestation period of about 30 days.\n\nTaxonomy and evolution\nThe African striped weasel was first described in 1864, when British zoologist John Edward Gray studied a skin of the animal purchased by the British Museum ten years earlier that was labeled as that of a \"zorilla\". He recognized that this skin was unlike that of any other known member of the mustelid family, and determined that it represented a new species which he named Zorilla albinucha. The specific name combines the Latin words albi meaning 'white' and nucha meaning 'nape'. Five years later, Gray published a catalogue of some of the mammal specimens in the British Museum, in which he moved the species into the genus Mustela as Mustela albinucha, commenting that it only has the colouration of a zorilla. In 1883, another British zoologist, Oldfield Thomas, noticed that the species had significant differences in the skull compared to any known mustelid genera. He therefore established the new genus Poecilogale, the sole included species being Poecilogale albinucha. The generic name is derived from the Ancient Greek words poikilos (ποικίλος), meaning 'particoloured' or 'cunning', and galē (γαλῆ), meaning 'weasel'. Thomas' study was based on five African striped weasel specimens, four of which were kept in the British Museum, with the remaining one in the Paris Museum of Natural History.\nIn 1865, German naturalist Wilhelm Peters reported two mustelid specimens from Golungo Alto, Angola. He described one of them as a new species which he named Zorilla africana, and thought the other should also be considered a variety of this species. However, Austrian explorer Friedrich Welwitsch told him that the latter specimen represents the species named a year earlier as Zorilla albinucha. Welwitsch believed that the two forms were consistently different, and that even the local indigenous population refers to them by different names. In the same year, Portuguese zoologist José Vicente Barbosa du Bocage studied two skins and a skeleton of African striped weasels from Calandula, Angola and proposed that the animal's scientific name be changed to Zorilla flavistriata. Both Zorilla africana and Zorilla flavistriata are no longer deemed valid names, and are now considered junior synonyms of Poecilogale albinucha.\n\nSubspecies\nA number of African striped weasel subspecies have been proposed during the 20th century, though there is debate as to how many of these are valid. Some authors believe that the species is monotypic and that all proposed subspecies should be considered invalid. The following five subspecies were recognized in the third edition of Mammal Species of the World, published in 2005:\n\nEvolution\nThe African striped weasel is the only species in the monotypic genus Poecilogale, which belongs in the subfamily Ictonychinae within the family Mustelidae. Ictonychinae is divided into two tribes, Ictonychini and Lyncodontini. This species is part of Ictonychini, which it shares with the striped polecat, Saharan striped polecat and marbled polecat. Genetic analyses indicate that the closest living relative of the African striped weasel is the striped polecat, with the two being recovered as sister taxa in multiple studies. A study published in 2008 suggested that the lineages of these two species diverged between 2.7 and 2.2 million years ago, while a 2012 study proposed an earlier date between 4.3 and 3.4 million years ago. The following cladogram shows the position of the African striped weasel among its closest living relatives according to Gray et al., (2022):\n\nA fossil species, Propoecilogale bolti, was originally named as a member of the genus Ictonyx, but has been placed in a separate genus since 1987. It shows features in its skull and teeth that are intermediate between Ictonyx and Poecilogale, and has been suggested to be an ancestor of the African striped weasel. Fossil specimens of Propoecilogale have been found in the Late Pliocene and Early Pleistocene-aged cave deposits of South Africa, suggesting the animal existed between 2.6 and 1.4 million years ago.\n\nDescription\nOne of the smallest carnivorans found in Africa (along with the dwarf mongoose), the African striped weasel has a slender body and short legs, and is the proportionally longest mammal native to the continent. It has small eyes, a short, broad snout, and short, rounded ears. Adults have a head-body length of 24 to 35 cm (9 to 14 in), with the tail adding a further 13.8 to 21.5 cm (5 to 8 in). This species exhibits sexual dimorphism, with males being larger than females. Six males sampled in KwaZulu-Natal in 1978 weighed an average of 339 g (12 oz), and three sampled in the former Cape Province in 1981 had an average weight of 357 g (13 oz). In comparison, 251 g (9 oz) and 215 g (8 oz) were the average weights of females according to the same respective studies, with the former sampling six females and the latter sampling two. The fur is mostly black, with a white patch on the top of the head which splits into two and then four white to pale yellowish bands running down the back. The bands may change in hue and become darker, with those of one subadult recorded to change from white to a light honey colour within a time span of about six weeks, and those of a different individual in captivity were reported to change from light yellow to deep buff. Staining caused by the soil in its habitat may cause these bands to appear red, grey or yellow, particularly in periods of rain. The width of the bands varies between individuals; some specimens found in Botswana have bands reaching 1.5 cm (0.6 in) in width, whereas they only reach 0.7 cm (0.3 in) in others. The tail is completely white in colour and has a bushy appearance, with each of its hairs growing about 3 cm (1 in). In comparison, most of the body has hairs which are around 1 cm (0.4 in) long, and those on the limbs are only 0.5 cm (0.2 in) long.\nThe head is elongated, with the skulls of some females measured in 1951 reaching an average length of 5.13 cm (2 in) and an average width of 2.36 cm (1 in) at the zygomatic arches (cheek area). The lower jaw fits tightly into the jaw joint, which greatly limits its ability to move its jaw from side to side. The carnassial teeth are sharp, and the canine teeth are long. The dentition has a dental formula of 3.1.2.13.1.2.1, that is, three incisors, one canine, two premolars and one molar on either half of each jaw, for a total of 28 teeth. This differs from the striped polecat (its closest living relative) in having one less premolar on each side of each jaw and one less molar on each side of the lower jaw. The absence of those teeth is a derived trait differing from the ancestral condition retained by the striped polecat, as are some features of the cusps (projecting parts) of the first molar (namely the absence of a metaconid and the fusion of the metacone and paracone).\n\nLike other mustelids, the limbs of an African striped weasel each have five digits, with each digit bearing a sharp claw. The front claws are larger and more curved than the hind claws. Each digit has an oval-shaped pad on its underside. The undersides of the paws are mostly hairless, each one having a large, four-lobed plantar pad, with each front limb having two additional carpal pads on the wrist. In this aspect it differs from some mustelids (whose paws have hairy undersides) and is most similar to the Malayan weasel and back-striped weasel. However, the African striped weasel differs from these two species in having larger front claws and the third and fourth digits of the hind limbs being closer together. This makes it a rare example of a mustelid whose paws are intermediate in form between cursorial paw forms (adapted for running like in the Malayan and back striped weasels) and fossorial paw forms (adapted for digging like in the striped polecat). Females usually have four teats, though some have been found with six. Like many other mustelids, the African striped weasel has a developed pair of perineal scent glands.\n\nDistribution and habitat\nThe African striped weasel inhabits much of Africa south of the equator, being found from the Democratic Republic of the Congo to Kenya in the north, and as far south as southern South Africa. It occurs in moist habitats with an annual rainfall of over 60 cm (24 in). It is often found in savannah and veld environments where termite mounds are present, with a 1978 survey revealing that 75% of African striped weasel sightings were made in such grasslands. However, the species appears to tolerate a wide range of habitats, having also been seen in semideserts, rainforests, fynbos and pine plantations, and roadkill carcasses have been collected in agricultural land. Considering the increase in sightings from regions formerly believed to be unsuitable for them (such as in southwestern South Africa in 1998), the weasel may be more widespread than previously thought. It commonly lives below 1,500 m (4,921 ft) elevation, but may occasionally be found as high as 2,200 m (7,218 ft).\n\nBehaviour and ecology\nThe African striped weasel is a mostly nocturnal animal, though it can sometimes be found at dawn or dusk. This species walks with a distinctive gait, with the body stretched out or arched while the snout is held low to the ground, swinging the front part of its body from side to side in a snake-like manner. It regularly stops to stand on its hind legs so that it can survey its surroundings. These weasels are effective diggers and construct their own burrows, sometimes working in pairs to do so, using their front limbs to dig into the ground and their hind limbs to kick soil backwards. However, they may sometimes rest in natural cavities such as hollow logs or rock crevices. They defecate in well-defined latrine locations, raising their tails almost vertically when doing so, possibly as a means of scent marking. In the wild, these latrines are commonly at the bases of trees and termite mounds, whereas captive animals may deposit dung against a vertical wall instead. Captive females with nursing young have been recorded to dip their necks into water during very hot weather, which may be to both cool themselves and carry water so that they can moisten and cool their young.\n\nSocial behaviour and communication\nAfrican striped weasels are generally solitary, but may occasionally be seen in pairs or family groups of up to four individuals. Males are aggressive when they encounter one another, at first bristling up the hair on their tails, making short cries and fake charges, and then escalating to fighting with bites, thrashing, and aggressive shrieks if neither individual retreats. The species has been identified as making six different calls. Apart from the warning and aggressive calls, and a third call that transitions between the two, another call signals submission of a retreating male. In addition, there is a call which indicates surrender during a fight, and a greeting call is used only between males and females and between young and their mother. Young weasels also make distress calls when separated from their mother.\n\nFeeding\nAfrican striped weasels are specialist predators known to hunt small mammals and birds, with the vast majority of their diet consisting of rodents of their own size or smaller, and will travel into the burrows of rodents to hunt them. While they occasionally feed on reptiles, insects, and eggs, in experiments conducted during the 1970s, captive striped weasels did not attack or eat several genera of invertebrates (including various insects), reptiles, amphibians and chicken eggs offered to them, even while hungry. The weasels hunt primarily by scent, attacking prey with a sudden lunge and biting onto the back of the neck. After the initial strike, they roll around and kick the prey animal's back or pelvic region, perhaps in order to dislocate the prey's neck (as suggested in 1978 by South African researcher David T. Rowe-Rowe). When taking on larger prey such as rats, which can weigh more than the weasels themselves, adult female weasels bite at the throat instead, though males have not been recorded doing this. Prey is generally eaten whole while the weasel is in a crouched pose, though the feathers and legs of birds and the stomachs of mammals are sometimes left uneaten. Unlike the related striped polecat, this species does not use its front limbs to stabilize its food while eating. Although African striped weasels eat smaller prey weighing up to 180 g (6.3 oz) head first, larger prey is eaten from the shoulder first. They sometimes store prey in their burrow instead of eating it immediately, picking up small prey by the back skin off the ground and dragging larger prey backwards towards the storage area. The gut of an African striped weasel is between 1.75 and 2 times the length of its body excluding the tail, and food passes through rather quickly, with defecation occurring approximately 165 minutes after the food was consumed.\nThey do not drink frequently, gaining most of their moisture requirements through their food. When they do drink, they do so by lapping up water with their tongues. A male kept in a cage for two weeks during the winter did not drink almost any water during this time, only occasionally drinking small amounts of water during hot weather.\n\nReproduction\nThe breeding season of the African striped weasel is extensive, lasting from spring to the end of summer. The testes of the male remain large from September to April (spring to early autumn) and are shrunken for the rest of the year. A soft chattering sound, believed to be a greeting call, is emitted by the male when courting a female during this time. If the female is receptive, she may express her receptiveness by moving around him. The male will then gently chew on her cheek, sniff her vulva and hold onto her neck from behind. During mating, the male continues to grip the female's neck from behind while clutching his forelimbs around her pelvic region. The duration of copulation is variable and can be as short as 27 minutes, though it typically lasts between 60 and 80 minutes. At least three bouts of copulation can occur within a day. Females raise the young with no aid from the males and give birth to one litter per year of two or three young after a gestation period of about 30 days, though they may have a second litter if the first is lost early.\nBirth takes place in a burrow during the daytime, and the mother eats the placenta afterwards. The newborn young weigh just 4 g (0.14 oz) each. They are almost hairless, with their pink skin visible over most of the body, a mane of white hair on the back of the head, and a hump which stretches from the back of the head to the shoulders. Their mother carries them by this hump until it and the mane disappear at seven weeks, at which point she carries them by the scruff of the neck instead. Newborns have closed eyes and ears, making them blind and deaf, despite the eye slits and pinnae (ear flaps) already being present. Their skin becomes dark at seven days old, and the prominent black and white colouration of the species develops at 28 days old. Their milk canine teeth grow out at five weeks, at which point they begin eating the soft parts of prey killed by their mother, with permanent canines growing at 11 weeks before the milk canines are shed. Their eyes open at an age of 51 to 54 days. By 11 weeks of age they are weaned (stop drinking milk), and they start killing their own prey at 13 weeks. They reach full adult size at 20 weeks, and are sexually mature at eight months.\n\nMortality and defense\nThe lifespan of the African striped weasel is short, with captive individuals recorded to only live for five or six years. Tuberculosis of the spleen is a common cause of death in some captive weasels. They are also known to kill each other in intraspecific fights (fights with others of their species). Documented predators of wild individuals include owls and domestic dogs, with humans also sometimes trapping and killing them when they visit chicken houses or to use them in traditional medicine. Some fall victim to vehicular collisions, as evidenced by roadkill carcasses found in agricultural areas. The tapeworm Taenia brachyacantha is also a known parasite of the species.\nWhen startled, African striped weasels attempt to flee by escaping into a hole, or (according to anecdotal evidence) occasionally by climbing up trees. If unable to flee, the animal may emit a sound similar to a growl or shriek while raising its tail and making fake charges at the perceived threat. If this fails, the weasel may spray a yellowish, musky fluid from its perineal glands that can be ejected up to 1 m (3 ft 3 in) away. Though this fluid has a heavy, sweet and pungent smell which has been described as \"foul\", it apparently is not nauseating and less persistent than the similar secretions of skunks and striped polecats.\n\nConservation\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) first assessed the African striped weasel in 1996 and listed it as a Least Concern species on the IUCN Red List, with the same listing given in subsequent assessments in 2008 and 2015, citing that although it is not commonly seen, it has a wide distribution and habitat tolerance. The IUCN did not make any population estimates for the species, simply stating that the number of mature individuals is unknown, but notes that it is \"rare to uncommon\". It is not known to face any major threats, even though it is one of the most regularly used species in local traditional medicine. In addition, its skin is used as a good luck charm. Modification of the weasel's preferred grassland habitat due to human activities such as agriculture and livestock grazing may also pose a threat.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "Lajos Martin (30 August 1827 – 4 March 1897) was a Hungarian mathematician and engineer, known by his works in transportation and aerodynamics.\n\nLife and work\nHe was the seventh son of a wine grower. After completing his studies in the Roman Catholic Secondary School, he began studies in the University of Pest. The 1848 European revolutions disrupted his studies and due his active participation was imprisoned and after enrolled in the Imperial Army. Finally, he finished his studies graduating in 1854 in the Military Engineering Academy in Vienna.\nHe was teaching in the Vienna's Military School until 1859 when he left the army and returned to Buda where he worked privately as civil engineer until 1861. From 1863 to 1868 he was teaching at secondary schools in Selmecbánya and Pressburg and he wrote some textbooks on mathematics in this level.\nIn 1872 he was appointed professor of mathematics in the university of Kolozsvár. He became rector of the university in 1895–1896 and in his inaugural discourse he spoke about the importance of flights in the transportation of people and goods.\nHe began his research in ballistics in the army, and he followed his theoretical and experimental works in this area all his life. He became also interested in hydraulics and in the search of the most efficient propeller. In his last years he worked in aerodynamics and he had a very clear idea about aviation would be in the future.\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nBitay, Enikő; Máté, Márton (2013). \"Martin Lajos a Feltaláló Mérnök és Lebegökerke\".

    "title": "Real estate",
    "text": "Real estate is a property consisting of land and the buildings on it, along with its natural resources such as growing crops (e.g. timber), minerals or water, and wild animals; immovable property of this nature; an interest vested in this (also) an item of real property, (more generally) buildings or housing in general. In terms of law, real relates to land property and is different from personal property, while estate means the \"interest\" a person has in that land property.\nReal estate is different from personal property, which is not permanently attached to the land (or comes with the land), such as vehicles, boats, jewelry, furniture, tools, and the rolling stock of a farm and farm animals.\nIn the United States, the transfer, owning, or acquisition of real estate can be through business corporations, individuals, nonprofit corporations, fiduciaries, or any legal entity as seen within the law of each U.S. state.\n\nHistory of real estate\nThe natural right of a person to own property as a concept can be seen as having roots in Roman law as well as Greek philosophy. The profession of appraisal can be seen as beginning in England during the 1500s, as agricultural needs required land clearing and land preparation. Textbooks on the subject of surveying began to be written and the term \"surveying\" was used in England, while the term \"appraising\" was more used in North America. Natural law which can be seen as \"universal law\" was discussed among writers of the 15th and 16th century as it pertained to \"property theory\" and the inter-state relations dealing with foreign investments and the protection of citizens private property abroad. Natural law can be seen as having an influence in Emerich de Vattel's 1758 treatise The Law of Nations which conceptualized the idea of private property.\nOne of the largest initial real estate deals in history known as the \"Louisiana Purchase\" happened in 1803 when the Louisiana Purchase Treaty was signed. This treaty paved the way for western expansion and made the U.S. the owners of the \"Louisiana Territory\" as the land was bought from France for fifteen million dollars, making each acre roughly 4 cents. The oldest real estate brokerage firm was established in 1855 in Chicago, Illinois, and was initially known as \"L. D. Olmsted & Co.\" but is now known as \"Baird & Warner\". In 1908, the National Association of Realtors was founded in Chicago and in 1916, the name was changed to the National Association of Real Estate Boards and this was also when the term \"realtor\" was coined to identify real estate professionals.\nThe stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression in the U.S. caused a major drop in real estate worth and prices and ultimately resulted in depreciation of 50% for the four years after 1929. Housing financing in the U.S. was greatly affected by the Banking Act of 1933 and the National Housing Act in 1934 because it allowed for mortgage insurance for home buyers and this system was implemented by the Federal Deposit Insurance as well as the Federal Housing Administration. In 1938, an amendment was made to the National Housing Act and Fannie Mae, a government agency, was established to serve as a secondary market for mortgages and to give lenders more money in order for new homes to be funded.\nTitle VIII of the Civil Rights Act in the U.S., which is also known as the Fair Housing Act, was put into place in 1968 and dealt with the incorporation of African Americans into neighborhoods as the issues of discrimination were analyzed with the renting, buying, and financing of homes. Internet real estate as a concept began with the first appearance of real estate platforms on the World Wide Web (www) and occurred in 1999.\n\nResidential real estate\nResidential real estate may contain either a single family or multifamily structure that is available for occupation or for non-business purposes.\nResidences can be classified by and how they are connected to neighbouring residences and land. Different types of housing tenure can be used for the same physical type. For example, connected residences might be owned by a single entity and leased out, or owned separately with an agreement covering the relationship between units and common areas and concerns.\nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, in 2021, 65% of homes in the U.S. are owned by the occupier.\n\nMajor categories\nAttached / multi-unit dwellings\nApartment (American English) or Flat (British English) – An individual unit in a multi-unit building. The boundaries of the apartment are generally defined by a perimeter of locked or lockable doors. Often seen in multi-story apartment buildings.\nMulti-family house – Often seen in multi-story detached buildings, where each floor is a separate apartment or unit.\nTerraced house (a.k.a. townhouse or rowhouse) – A number of single or multi-unit buildings in a continuous row with shared walls and no intervening space.\nCondominium (American English) – A building or complex, similar to apartments, owned by individuals. Common grounds and common areas within the complex are owned and shared jointly. In North America, there are townhouse or rowhouse style condominiums as well. The British equivalent is a block of flats.\nHousing cooperative (a.k.a. co-op) – A type of multiple ownership in which the residents of a multi-unit housing complex own shares in the cooperative corporation that owns the property, giving each resident the right to occupy a specific apartment or unit. Majority of housing in Indian metro cities are of these types.\nTenement – A type of building shared by multiple dwellings, typically with flats or apartments on each floor and with shared entrance stairway access found in Britain.\nSemi-detached dwellings\nDuplex – Two units with one shared wall.\nDetached dwellings\nBungalows\nSplit-level home\nMansions\nVillas\nDetached house or single-family detached house\nCottages\nPortable dwellings\nMobile homes, tiny homes, or residential caravans – A full-time residence that can be (although might not in practice be) movable on wheels.\nHouseboats – A floating home\nTents – Usually temporary, with roof and walls consisting only of fabric-like material.\nOther categories\n\nChawls\nHavelis\nIgloos\nHuts\nThe size of havelis and chawls is measured in Gaz (square yards), Quila, Marla, Beegha, and acre.\nSee List of house types for a complete listing of housing types and layouts, real estate trends for shifts in the market, and house or home for more general information.\n\nReal estate and the environment\nReal estate can be valued or devalued based on the amount of environmental degradation that has occurred. Environmental degradation can cause extreme health and safety risks. There is a growing demand for the use of site assessments (ESAs) when valuing a property for both private and commercial real estate.\nEnvironmental surveying is made possible by environmental surveyors who examine the environmental factors present within the development of real estate as well as the impacts that development and real estate has on the environment.\nGreen development is a concept that has grown since the 1970s with the environmental movement and the World Commission on Environment and Development. Green development examines social and environmental impacts with real estate and building. There are 3 areas of focus, being the environmental responsiveness, resource efficiency, and the sensitivity of cultural and societal aspects. Examples of Green development are green infrastructure, LEED, conservation development, and sustainability developments.\nReal estate in itself has been measured as a contributing factor to the rise in green house gases. According to the International Energy Agency, real estate in 2019 was responsible for 39 percent of total emissions worldwide and 11 percent of those emissions were due to the manufacturing of materials used in buildings.\n\nDevelopment\nReal estate development involves planning and coordinating of housebuilding, real estate construction or renovation projects. Real estate development can be less cyclical than real estate investing.\n\nInvestment\nIn markets where land and building prices are rising, real estate is often purchased as an investment, whether or not the owner intends to use the property. Often investment properties are rented out, but \"flipping\" involves quickly reselling a property, sometimes taking advantage of arbitrage or quickly rising value, and sometimes after repairs are made that substantially raise the value of the property. Luxury real estate is sometimes used as a way to store value, especially by wealthy foreigners, without any particular attempt to rent it out. Some luxury units in London and New York City have been used as a way for corrupt foreign government officials and business people from countries without strong rule of law to launder money or to protect it from seizure. Investment in real estate can be categorized by financial risk into core, value-added, and opportunistic. Real estate value tends to depreciate with age according to hedonic regression.\n\nProfessionals\nReal estate agent – North America\nEstate agent – United Kingdom\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\n The dictionary definition of real estate at Wiktionary\n Quotations related to Real estate at Wikiquote",

    "text": "The Queen's Tiara (Swedish: Drottningens juvelsmycke, lit. 'The Queen's Jewels') is a classic Swedish novel by Carl Jonas Love Almquist.\nIt is the fourth instalment in the series of novels known as Törnrosens bok ('The Book of the Thorn Rose') and was published in 1834. Drottningens juvelsmycke was the first original historical novel to be written in Sweden, and features one of Swedish literature's most enduringly popular characters, the intersex Tintomara.\n\nPlot\nThe novel is set in 1792 and weaves the story of the beautiful but sexless androgyne Tintomara around the assassination of King Gustav III of Sweden, \"a vigorous patron of the arts\" commonly nicknamed \"The Theatre King\", on the stage of Stockholm's Royal Swedish Opera at a masked ball in 1792.  \nTintomara is employed by the Royal Swedish Ballet to function as the centrepiece of their lavish spectacles. Tintomara's true gender is never made clear, but Tintomara is referred to by the pronoun \"She\". She is described as beautiful and is often the object of passion for both men and women.\nTintomara is portrayed as the secret half sibling to the underage King, Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden. Her father was Count Adolf Fredrik Munck af Fulkila, and her mother was the actress Clara: Count Adolf Fredrik Munck af Fulkila was said to be the biological father of the king and lover of the Queen, Sophia Magdalena of Denmark.     \nPassing as a girl, Tintomara is involved in the notorious assassination of the King. On the same night, she steals the Queen's tiara in order to show it to her mother. Tintomara is then taken under the protection of a Baroness, who hides her on her country estate, where Tintomara passes as a boy. In the country, she becomes the love object of two women, Amanda and Adolfine, the daughters of the Baroness; and two men, the nobles Ferdinand and Clas-Henrik, who earlier courted the sisters and who are now concealing their involvement in the assassination. \nTintomara is killed by Ferdinand during a performance planned as a spectacular entertainment for the court which ends in disaster.\nThe novel's most famous line is spoken by Tintomara's dying mother, Clara: \"Tintomara, two things are white - Innocence and Arsenic\". She continues \"You have the Innocence - I have the Arsenic\".\n\nTrivia\nTintomara is said to have been inspired by the daughter of Giovanna Bassi, Johanna Fredrika (1787–1810), who was presumed to be fathered by Count Adolf Fredrik Munck af Fulkila. By persistent rumors, the count was said to be the true father of Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden; Bassi's daughter was said to have a strong resemblance to the King, who might have been her half-brother.\nAnother role model and source of inspiration was reportedly the contemporary transsexual Andreas Bruce.\n\nPeople\nAdolfine - daughter of the baroness\nAmanda - daughter of the baroness\nThe ballet master - employer of Tintomara\nBenjamin Cohen - money lender\nClara - mother of Tintomara\nClas Henrik - a young noble conspirator\nEmmanuel - brother of Tintomara\nFerdinand - a young noble conspirator\nThe Baroness - protector of Tintomara and mother of Adolfine and Amanda\nThe Uncle - brother of the Baroness\nTintomara - the main character\n\nReal people in the novel\nJohan Jacob Anckarström\nGustav III of Sweden\nGustav IV Adolf of Sweden – portrayed as the half-brother of Tintomara.\nGustaf Adolf Reuterholm – attempts to seduce Tintomara\nHedwig Elizabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp\nCharles XIII of Sweden – attempts to seduce Tintomara\nMagdalena Rudenschöld – an ally in Tintomara's attempt to escape persecution\n\nFilm adaptation\n\nA Swedish-Danish film production entitled Tintomara was released in 1970.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "Palat – Tera Hero Idhar Hai",
    "text": "\"Palat – Tera Hero Idhar Hai\" (transl. Turn around – Your hero is here) is a Hindi song from the 2014 Hindi film Main Tera Hero. Composed by Sajid–Wajid, the song is sung by Arijit Singh, with lyrics penned by Kausar Munir and Danish Sabri. The music video features Varun Dhawan and Ileana D'Cruz.\n\nBackground\nThe song is composed by Sajid–Wajid and rendered by Arijit Singh, marking their first collaboration which is followed by \"Raat Bhar\" from Heropanti which was released the same year. It is also the first song which features Dhawan in a song sung by Singh, followed by \"Samjhawan\" from Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania, which was also released on the same year. Singh has performed another track in the album, titled \"Shanivaar Raati\" a duet with Shalmali Kholgade.\nThe producers of the film capitulating on the popularity of the song \"Palat – Tera Hero Idhar Hai\" from the soundtrack attached a remix version of it along with the theatrical prints of Ragini MMS 2 which released on 21 March 2014—instead of the theatrical trailer—marking the first such instance. Some critics compared the track, \"Palat – Tera Hero Idhar Hai\" to the 1981 song, \"Jahan Teri Yeh Nazar Hai\" from the soundtrack of the film, Kaalia. Talking about the resemblance, Sajid stated: \"I won't deny any influence in our work, but I am not sure to what extent it goes\". According to him the lyrics and the vibe of the song are similar, though the tune is different. The song was talked for its similarity with many tracks performed by Govinda.\nThe song is directed by David Dhawan who is contributed by his elder son, Rohit. The lyrics of the song is penned by Kausar Munir who stated; \" To crack this very simple yet catchy and populist vibe is hard, and I don't understand the game of hits and flops\". Additional lyrics of the song is penned by Danish Sabri. Since the song required Dhawan to involve a lot of heavy duty steps on the ground with body weight balanced on the hands solely and to avoid any injuries to his wrist and hand, he suggested wearing biker's gloves.\nThe promotional released music video features, Nargis Fakhri through various snippets from the film and songs like \"Galat Baat Hai\" and \"Shanivaar Raat\". However the video used in the movie, features Varun Dhawan and Ileana D'Cruz with no frames of Fakhri. In the music video of the song, he dances in the middle of a basketball court, on a wall and even while hanging from an artificial climbing rockface. The song starts as Dhawan tries wooing Ileana on a college campus who is then accompanied by a bunch of guys, showing some Bollywood dance moves.\n\nRelease and response\nA 15-second teaser of the song was released on YouTube handle of T-Series, on 26 February 2014. The promotional music video of the song was uploaded on 28 February 2014. The full version of the audio track was released digitally on 3 March 2014, in the soundtrack of the album.\nTalking about the popularity of the song, Ileana D'Cruz said; \"Songs are such an important part of the film. I am very happy and surprised that 'Palat' became a big hit\". Regarding the success of the song, Varun Dhawan commented: \"While promoting the film in various cities, I was inundated with requests to dance on Palat. In Indore, when we asked the crowd to select a track, this song was the unanimous choice. They went berserk when it was played\".\n\nCritical reception\nJoginder Tuteja from Rediff.com felt the song has \"catchy beats and a foot-tapping rhythm\", calling it as \"the height of the masala score\". Devesh Sharma from Filmfare talked about the resemblance of the song with the RD Burman's composition and commented: \"Singh sings it in full Kishore Kumar mode and you can’t help but smile at the nostalgic feel that it provides as well is own comic resonance\".

    "title": "Creators: The Past",
    "text": "Creators: The Past is an Italian science fiction fantasy film directed by Piergiuseppe Zaia, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Eleonora Fani and composed the soundtrack. The film stars Eleonora Fani, Jennifer Mischiati, Bruce Payne, and Per Fredrik Åsly in the lead roles, and features guest appearances by Gérard Depardieu and William Shatner. The story is about how the destinies of mankind are being manipulated by a race of powerful extraterrestrials known as the Creators. \nThe film was announced as the first part of a planned trilogy, whose next two installments would have been Creators: The Present and Creators: The Future. Principal photography began in 2014, but the film did not reach theaters before 2020. Its release in Italy suffered from the COVID-19 pandemic and it flopped at the box office. The film later generated some curiosity in Italy due to the script's allusions to conspiracy theories.\n\nPlot\nThe film provides a fictional explanation as to why the Mayan prophecy did not come to pass. As the end of the year 2012 arrives, the universe is about to undergo an extraordinary planetary alignment which will cause a total eclipse to be visible from planet Earth. The eight members of the Galactic Council regulating the stability of the universe gather to discuss the effects of the coming alignment. Each of the godlike members of the council is a \"Creator\" governing their own planet. All the data regarding the planets, including the secrets about the DNA of their respective species, are recorded into mystical objects known as the lens.\nFollowing the rebellion of Lord Kanaff, the regent of planet Earth, the Galactic Council loses control of the lens which contains the recording of the entire history and the memories of humanity. The data contained in the object includes the secret that mankind was created by aliens and that all religions are a sham to keep humanity under control. Sofy, a young woman who was abducted as a child by aliens, is entrusted by the Creators with the task of locating the missing lens. The female warrior Lady Airre is sent by the council of the Creators to capture Lord Kanaff. Meanwhile, another Creator, Lord Kal, has been secretly plotting to take control of Earth through the Illuminati, in order to replace his own dying planet.\n\nCast\nEleonora Fani as Lady Airre, an emissary of the Creators\nBruce Payne as Lord Kal, a villainous Creator who wants to take control of planet Earth\nJennifer Mischiati as Sofy, a young woman entrusted with finding the missing lens\nPer Fredrik Åsly as Alex Walker, a young doctor who helps Sofy in her quest\nMarc Fiorini as Lord Kanaff, the regent of planet Earth\nWilliam Shatner as Lord Ogmha, chairman of the Creators' Galactic Council\nGérard Depardieu as the Master of Faith, an agent of the Creators who secretly oversees all of Earth's religions\nKsenia Prohaska as Dr. Ferrari, one of Lord Kal's evil minions\nAngelo Minoli as Natan, a man created by Lady Airre using the DNA of Jesus Christ\nSébastien Foucan as Tammuz, Natan's \"brother\"\nYohann Chopin as Chris Walker\nElio Pascarelli as Young Natan\nElisabetta Coraini as Elizabeth\nPete Antico as Lord Marduk, a member of the Galactic council\nDaniel McVicar as Dan Anderson\nKristina Pimenova as Singing Child\nJonna Cambrand as Joro\nMauro Biglino as himself\nPiergiuseppe Zaia as Jesus Christ\n\nProduction\nThe film originated with a project by music composer and festival organizer Piergiuseppe Zaia and psychologist and alternative medicine therapist Eleonora Fani. Zaia and Fani co-wrote the screenplay, with Zaia directing the film and Fani playing one of the lead roles. The film was shot on location in Italy, mostly in the Piedmont region. Locations included the province of Biella and the historical area of Canavese in Piedmont, as well as the Aosta Valley and Venice. Some scenes were filmed at the Verrès Castle and the Castle Savoia. The city of Biella and its province were actively involved in the making of the film, for which they provided locations as well as funding. The film's production also received support from the province's Confederation of Industry branch. Gérard Depardieu's involvement in the production reportedly played an important role in gaining support from public authorities in the Biella province. Michel J. Vandewalle, who had been an executive producer on Iron Sky (2012), worked on the film in a similar capacity.\nThe film's budget was reported to be about 8 million euros. Part of the funding came from contributions by businesses from the Biella province, who were incited to invest a minimum of 12,500 euros. Some businesses reportedly invested hundreds of thousands.  In Canavese, private individuals reportedly invested in the picture through their banker. The production company was also granted a tax credit of over 765, 000 euros by the Italian ministry of culture. In 2021, after the film had been completed and released, the ministry granted the production company an incentive of about 389,000 euros, plus 71,000 euros to compensate for the COVID-related difficulties. \nPrincipal photography started in 2014. The first scenes involving Gérard Depardieu and Bruce Payne were shot in October of that year. Post-production took place at FotoKem in Burbank. The film, originally slated for a release in February 2016, remained unreleased at that date. In December 2017, director Zaia said that the film was \"almost ready\" for worldwide distribution and that it had been delayed in part due to the extensive use of green screen and special effects, and to the addition of new scenes involving new actors. As the film had been shot in English, the Italian dubbing had not yet been completed at that point.\n\nPromotion\nThe official trailer was shown on January 17, 2019, on Vimeo. A novelization, co-authored by Fani with her mother Gea Mizzani Corio, was released in February 2020 only in Italian.\n\nSoundtrack\nThe end credits theme song \"Across Endless Dimensions\" is performed by Dimash Kudaibergen. Director Piergiuseppe Zaia composed the song as well as the rest of the soundtrack.\n\nRelease\nThe film's trailer was released on March 6, 2019. Also in 2019, the film premiered in China at the Shanghai International Film Festival and in Santa Monica, United States at the Atlas International Film Exhibition. A promotional tour commenced in Italy at the Lucca Comics & Games festival. The film was first set to be theatrically released on March 13, 2020 but this was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The film was eventually released in cinemas in Italy on October 8, 2020, but was pulled from distribution two weeks later when Italian theaters closed again due to the resurging pandemic. \nThe film then remained entirely unavailable for over two years, generating some interest from Italian reviewers. On February 7, 2023, it was released to streaming on Amazon Prime, licensed exclusively in Italy and Vatican City, with only Italian dubs. A DVD, also with the Italian version, was released in 2023. The English-language version was later released on Amazon's video rental services.\n\nReception\nGiancarlo Zappoli of mymovies.it stated that the film's two strengths were its notable cast and the foray into fantasy and sci-fi (unusual for contemporary Italian films) but that the screenplay suffered from an abundance of subplots. Valerio Molinaro of Corriere spettacolo praised the film's scenography and its \"first-rate choral cast\" but found the screenplay \"not always up to par\". Antonio Palazzo of extratek.com commented that the film \"is an ambitious all-Italian Blockbuster, with an excellent background story\" and good performances from \"world-famous actors\" but that the screenplay was often confusing and that the film's running time did not allow the story to develop as it should have. Fiaba Di Martino of Film TV magazine criticized the screenplay and the underwritten characters, and compared the movie to an overenthusiastic fan film made for YouTube. Martina Catrambone of themacguffin.it wrote that the writing, editing, music, and special effects did not make any sense, and stated that such a film proved that Italian cinema should avoid science fiction. Alberto Mutignani of the online magazine The Walk of Fame called it \"the worst film of the year\", stating that the film ended up being an unintentional comedy, with a story so confusing that one wondered if some scenes were missing. \nCreators: the Past ranked ninth at the Italian box office during its first weekend, earning 69,000 euros. Some sources say it earned between 120,000  and 130,000 euros before its release was cut short by the resurging COVID-19 pandemic. The revenue for the producers, after deduction of ticket sales fees, was reported to be a mere 47,000 euros.\nIn January 2021, director Piergiuseppe Zaia stated that despite the film's aborted release, he and Fani were working on what would be the second installment of the trilogy. However, his production company, Artuniverse, was liquidated in December 2023 due to its inability to generate revenues. In 2025, Zaia said that he was no longer involved in filmmaking.\n\nControversies\nUpon the film's release, a reviewer noted that the story alluded to all sorts of conspiracy theories, as evidenced by the cameo of author Mauro Biglino.\nSince the film became available again, it has gained minor \"cult\" status in Italy due to its conspiracist content.\nAfter the film's 2020 release, Eleonora Fani gained some following on YouTube and Telegram, publishing videos where she appeared to take seriously the film's content, including theories about ancient astronauts. She went on to publish geopolitical content that praised Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, and to promote QAnon-influenced conspiracy theories.\nIn 2025, several private investors who had participated in the film's funding filed a complaint against Zaia, Fani, and a banker who had organised the fundraising, saying that they had been defrauded. The disgruntled investors said the film never had a proper distribution plan. Zaia blamed the COVID-19 pandemic for the project's failure.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n(IT) Official website \nCreators-The Past at IMDb",

    "title": "HD 18742",
    "text": "HD 18742 (proper name Ayeyarwady) is a 8th-magnitude subgiant star located about 530 light-years (160 pc) away in the constellation of Eridanus. It is orbited by one confirmed exoplanet, super-Jupiter HD 18742 b (proper name Bagan), and possibly by another Jovian planetary candidate (HD 18742 c).\n\nStellar characteristics\nHD 18742 is a yellow subgiant star with a spectral type of G8/K0 IV. Its physical parameters vary from publication to publication, with calculated radii ranging between 4.08–6.34 R☉, and mass estimates falling mostly between 1.36–1.73 M☉, though a 2017 paper suggests a significantly higher value of 2.58±0.24 M☉. The star has an effective temperature of about 5,000 K (4,730 °C; 8,540 °F) and a luminosity of 13.2 or 20.7 L☉, and is thought to be about 2.3–2.5 billion years old. Seen from Earth, the star has an apparent magnitude of 7.81, making it visible with binoculars and by the naked eye under the darkest skies with effort.\n\nNomenclature\nIn 2019, the Republic of the Union of Myanmar was assigned to giving the HD 18742 system a proper name as part of the IAU100 NameExoWorlds Project, planned to celebrate the hundredth anniversary of the International Astronomical Union (IAU), which grants the right to name an exoplanetary system to every state and territory in the world. Names were submitted and selected within Myanmar, which were then presented to the IAU to be officially recognized. On 17 December 2019, the IAU announced that HD 18742 and its confirmed planet, b, were named Ayeyarwady and Bagan, respectively.\nAyeyarwady was named after a river of the same name, the longest and most important river in Myanmar. Bagan refers to one of the ancient cities of the country located right beside the Ayeyarwady, which was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2019.\n\nPlanetary system\nIn 2011, radial-velocity observations made at the W. M. Keck Observatory revealed the existence of one exoplanet around HD 18742. The planet, HD 18742, is thought to be a gas giant with a minimum mass of 3.362 MJ, which orbits its host star at a distance of 1.82 AU once every 766 days (2.10 years). Its orbit is nearly circular (i.e., with a low eccentricity), similar to planets in the Solar System.\nOther than the doppler shifts caused by HD 18742 b, radial-velocity measurements used to discover the planet also included an additional linear trend. Utilizing data gathered at the Keck Observatory between 2007 and 2015, Luhn et al. subtracted the effects of HD 18742 b from the radial-velocity curve, revealing a 900-day-period signal, possibly caused by another similar planet. Though the existence of such a planet would provide a far better match to the observed curve, this signal remains a planetary candidate since it would be in a 9:10 resonance with HD 18742 b, a non-physical resonance that is previously unheard of. Follow-up observations are expected to show the true nature of the system.\n\nSee also\nList of proper names of stars\nList of proper names of exoplanets\nList of stars in Eridanus\nList of exoplanets discovered in 2011\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nJean Schneider. \"Planet HD 18742 b\".

    "text": "USNS Guadalupe (T-AO-200) is a Henry J. Kaiser-class underway replenishment oiler operated by the Military Sealift Command to support ships of the United States Navy.\nGuadalupe, the fourteenth ship of the Henry J. Kaiser class, was laid down at Avondale Shipyard, Inc., at New Orleans, Louisiana, on 9 July 1990 and launched on 5 October 1991. She entered non-commissioned U.S. Navy service under the control of the Military Sealift Command with a primarily civilian crew on 25 September 1992. She serves in the United States Pacific Fleet. In June 2004, USNS Guadalupe rescued 13 crew and a dog from the burning Taiwanese fishing vessel Hsin Chin Chanz, around 900 miles north east of Guam in the Pacific.\n\nDesign\nThe Henry J. Kaiser-class replenishment oilers were preceded by the shorter Cimarron class. Guadalupe has an overall length of 206.5 metres (677 ft 6 in). It has a beam of 29.7 metres (97 ft) and a draft of 11 metres (36 ft). The oiler has a displacement of 41,353 tonnes (40,700 long tons; 45,584 short tons) at full load. It has a capacity of 180,000 imperial barrels (29,000,000 L; 6,500,000 imp gal; 7,800,000 US gal) of aviation fuel or fuel oil. It can carry a dry load of 690 square metres (7,400 sq ft) and can refrigerate 128 pallets of food. The ship is powered by two 10 PC4.2 V 570 Colt-Pielstick diesel engines that drive two shafts; this gives a power of 25.6 megawatts (34,800 PS; 34,300 shp).\nThe Henry J. Kaiser-class oilers have maximum speeds of 20 knots (37 km/h; 23 mph). They were built without armaments but can be fitted with close-in weapon systems. The ship has a helicopter platform but not any maintenance facilities. It is fitted with five fuelling stations; these can fill two ships at the same time and the ship is capable of pumping 900,000 US gallons (3,400,000 L; 750,000 imp gal) of diesel or 540,000 US gallons (2,000,000 L; 450,000 imp gal) of jet fuel per hour.

    "title": "DUMBA",
    "text": "DUMBA was a collective living space and anarchist, queer, all-ages community center and venue in Brooklyn, New York.\nDUMBA (a feminized version of DUMBO—Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass, the name of its NYC neighborhood) became a radical cultural nexus point around which the Queercore movement flourished and an independent film scene developed.  It was the site of many notable events, as well as being a residence for a few dozen people over the years.  DUMBA was a unique experiment providing a combination of live music and disc jockeys (usually several DJs a night), film screenings of  Super 8 and 16mm films, video, artwork, performances, vegetarian food, and an unrestricted erotic atmosphere.\n\nBackground and history\nDUMBA was founded in a loft, during the summer of 1996 by a group of people which included filmmaker Scott Berry, Kelly Besser, Vincent Baker, and others. It would come to call itself the \"DUMBA Collective\" by around 2000.\nThe group's name, DUMBA, is derived from DUMBO, the neighborhood between Fulton Landing and Vinegar Hill.\nThe 5,000-square-foot (460 m2) loft used for the collective's space was commercially zoned under the Manhattan Bridge overpass and housed six or seven residents between the years 1996 and 2006. It has been described as  \"a maze of rooms small and large\".\nDUMBA lost its lease to the loft in 2006.\n\nProjects and Productions\nDUMBA first became known for putting on all-ages punk shows, which were promoted by word of mouth and simple photocopied flyers displaying a DIY aesthetic. Diana Morrow designed several of the flyers. Bands and performers who played DUMBA include The Need, Los Crudos, Limp Wrist, Nedra Johnson, The Spaceheads, Bitch and Animal, Octant, God Is My Co-Pilot, Tribe 8, Three Dollar Bill, Kaia, Patsy, The Lookers, and many more.  In time, the venue began to feature more diverse performances by artists such as Vaginal Davis.\n\nFuck the Mayor Collective\nDUMBA was also involved in the Fuck the Mayor Collective, a queer activist organization created in response to what some believed were the racist, classist, sexist, and homophobic policies of the Giuliani administration. In 1998, DUMBA and the Fuck the Mayor Collective created Gay Shame, a controversial anti-assimilationist and anti-consumerism response to the annual Gay Pride celebrations during June.  Kiki and Herb and Three Dollar Bill performed, and Eileen Myles, Mattilda aka Matt Bernstein Sycamore, and Penny Arcade spoke at the event that year, which was filmed by Scott Berry and released as the documentary film Gay Shame 98.  The event was written about by Alissa Chadburn in the San Francisco Bay Guardian:\n\nThe goal of Gay Shame in New York was to form a free \"non-consumerist space for creating culture and community building\" and to try to \"build some opposition to the reactionary gay mainstream,\" which [Mattilda] says has \"a stranglehold on all representations of queerness in the media.\n\nThe collective behind Gay Shame also produced a fanzine each year for the occasion of the event, entitled Swallow Your Pride. Gay Shame was held at DUMBA in June 1998 and June 2000 (June 17, 2000).\n\nQueeruption, 1999\nThe second iteration of Queeruption, an annual international Queercore festival, was largely housed at DUMBA October 7–11, 1999.  Hundreds of activists came from across the United States and Europe for this free, radical, queer \"encuentro\" that was part skill-share, part social event, and part conference, and that featured over 60 workshops, along with films, performances, and parties.  There was also a Columbus Day action in Central Park in which city vehicles were \"ticketed\" for parking on stolen land, and to protest the arrest of a gay man, allegedly for cruising in the park (he claimed to be urinating).\n\nBrooklyn Babylon Cinema\nBrooklyn Babylon Cinema, a recurring analog film screening series, was born at DUMBA and continued for several years. It featured events such as the \"Times Square Sinema\" on May 7, 1999, which provided a kissing booth and encouraged fraternization; a tribute to the Deuce's seedy past; and \"Caught Looking\" (March 2000), a program about voyeurism curated by Aaron Scott, which included two video programs, as well as installations by Rob Roth and others. Brooklyn Babylon Cinema regularly showed films by emerging directors, providing a space in which new work could develop, as well as work by better-known directors such as Sadie Benning, Anonymous Boy, G.B. Jones, Miranda July, and Scott Treleaven.\n\nLusty Loft Parties\nFrom 2000 through 2002, DUMBA was home to the \"Lusty Loft Parties,\" described by writer and sex columnist Tristan Taormino as \"pure queer erotic utopia, with people of all genders fucking side by side.\" These parties were deemed successful and were written about in Village Voice several times, notably by Guy Trebay and by Taormino, though several years after the fact.\nThe Lusty Loft Parties were part of the basis for the film Shortbus.\n\nThe DUMBA Collective\nAround 2000, the group living in the space called themselves the \"DUMBA Collective,\" a name that stuck until the collective's demise in 2006.\nIn 2004, writer Arial Levy described in New York Magazine DUMBA's trannyboi scene:\n\nBeing a boi means different things to different people—it’s a fluid identity, and that’s the whole point. Some women who call themselves bois are playing off \"boy\" in the gay-male S/M sense of the term, as in Daddy/Boy: The boy or boi is the submissive and, in the case of lesbians, has sex with dominant butches (tops). Some of the people who identify as bois are female-to-male transsexuals in various stages of the transition process, ranging from having had top surgery and taking testosterone (\"T\") to simply adopting the pronoun he. Some, like Lissa, date other bois and think of themselves as “fags,” while others only date femmes.\nThe article also noted that at Dumba \"[t]hey have sex parties and art shows, and above the bathroom door, instead of GIRLS or BOYS, it says TRANNIES.\"\n\nShortbus\nJohn Cameron Mitchell's film Shortbus (2006) was partially shot at DUMBA in 2005.  The \"Lusty Loft Parties\" are credited as the events on which he loosely based his movie. In the film, a hyperbolized DUMBA was the site of Justin Bond's salon. People associated with DUMBA appear in the film as \"sextras\".\nIn October 2006, Village Voice quoted John Cameron Mitchell discussing DUMBA:\n\nStill, real life and faux life merged while making the movie—the sexed-up loft scenes were shot in DUMBO at the DUMBA artists' space, and guess what: \"DUMBA—where we shot it—has been shut down,\" Mitchell says. \"The neighbors complained about parties and sex parties. The lease is up this December.\"\n\nTimeline of events that took place at DUMBA\nFuck the Mayor celebration\nThe annual Gay Shame event during Gay Pride (June 1998 and onward)\nSpin Cycle: The Game\nBrooklyn Babylon Cinema (1999 and onward), including the following film programs:\nPlease Kill dumba (12-hour film marathon), June 14, 1998\nSoiree Guy Debord, October 2, 1998\nWhat Goes Around Comes Around (queer shorts program), November 6, 1998\nFree the Land!

At the time of its completion in 1965, it was the tallest building in Ankara.\n\nConstruction\nThe building was commissioned by the Emekli Sandığı (Pension Fund, abbreviated as Emek) bound to the Social Security Administration of Turkey, and was built between 1959 and 1965 as a revenue generating property. The architects were Enver Tokay and İlhan Tayman, and the statics engineer was Yusuf Berdan.\nIt was one of the first International Style highrise buildings in Turkey, and the first with a glass curtain wall facade. Its design was primarily inspired by the Lever House (1952) building, blended with some of the facade characteristics of the United Nations Secretariat Building (1952) in New York City.\nThe ground floor and the first two floors were designed as a shopping center, while the other floors were reserved for offices. The building is situated to the southeast of Kızılay Square, opposite to the Kızılay (Turkish Red Crescent) building, which gives the square its name.\nConstruction works temporarily stopped due to the 1960 coup d'état, which delayed the completion and opening date to 1965.\n\nPrivatization\nOn March 8, 2006, the Privatization Board of Turkey sold the building for $55,500,000 to Talip Kahraman Construction Co.

    "title": "George Porteous",
    "text": "George Porteous  (April 7, 1903 – February 6, 1978) was the 14th lieutenant governor of Saskatchewan, from 1976 to 1978.\n\nEarly life\nGeorge Porteous was born in Douglas, Lanarkshire, Scotland on 7 April 1903. His family emigrated to Canada in 1910 and he attended secondary school in Saskatoon, going on to the University of Saskatchewan, where he was awarded BA in 1927. He began working for the YMCA as  boys’ work secretary in Saskatoon in 1922, later becoming an Army physical education instructor. At the outbreak of World War II he went with the 1st Canadian Division to England as a YMCA Auxiliary Service officer, returning later on to Canada to train others.\n\nWar service\nIn 1941 Porteous was posted with the Winnipeg Grenadiers to Hong Kong, to reinforce the British garrison. The regiment arrived just in time to be overwhelmed by invading Japanese forces, and Porteous was to spend a total of 44 months in one of the notorious prisoner of war camps, where he remained until the end of the war. In due course he was decorated as an MBE, Member of the Order of the British Empire, for his outstanding contribution in maintaining prisoner morale while imprisoned.\n\nHonours\nPorteous returned to Saskatoon after the war and was named executive director of the Saskatoon Community Chest. He was later awarded the Order of Canada in 1974 for dedication to community affairs, and was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of Saskatchewan, the Queen’s representative, on 3 March 1976, thus becoming that Province's 14th Lieutenant Governor. He died in office on 6 February 1978.\n\nMedical research\nAn interesting insight into Porteous' experience is that from 1960 until his death in 1978 Porteous was an enthusiastic advocate of the medical benefits of niacin. Dr. Abram Hoffer had approached him to request that he recommend it to the senior citizens in the social housing development which Porteous administered. Hoffer believed large doses of niacin, up to six grams a day, could retard the development and even reverse senility, as it dilates the blood vessels, thus improving circulation.\nPorteous insisted he would not recommend anything to anyone which he had not first tried himself. For six months, he took the six grams a day and then recommended it to the senior citizens without reservation. As he told the Department of Veterans Affairs doctor on his next annual visit (he was on a 100% disability pension) that he had not felt as well since before the war; he could even touch his hands together above his head, not having been able to raise them above his shoulders before the treatment. He discovered that niacin had greatly relieved the severe arthritis and insomnia that had plagued him as a result of his wartime imprisonment and systematic starvation over a four-year period.

    "text": "Kristina Wong, Sweatshop Overlord is a 2021 American play by Kristina Wong. Its premise is based on Wong's experience organizing hundreds of volunteers to sew masks amid the COVID-19 pandemic, calling themselves the \"Auntie Sewing Squad\". Over the course of the play, Wong uses comedy to address themes such as the often unattainable nature of the American Dream, anti-Asian racism in the U.S. caused by the pandemic, and the invisible labor of women and people and color. The play was a finalist for the 2022 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, and won the Lucille Lortel Award, Drama Desk Award, and Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Solo Show.\n\nSynopsis\nDuring the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, Kristina Wong begins sewing masks from old bedsheets and bra straps on her Hello Kitty sewing machine. She quickly organizes the Auntie Sewing Squad, a network of hundreds of volunteers—including children and her mother—working from home to produce masks and address gaps in the U.S. public health system. As the project grows, Wong reflects on the blurred line between mutual aid and cult-like dedication.\nAs demand for masks declines and pandemic restrictions ease, Wong navigates life after leading the group, exploring the challenges of rebuilding personal and communal connections. The performance combines humor and generosity, inviting the audience to witness Wong’s efforts to foster community during isolation while reflecting on the pandemic’s broader social impact.\n\nProduction history\nThe play was developed through live Zoom performances during the pandemic.\n\nNew York Theatre Workshop, NYC (2021)\nKristina Wong, Sweatshop Overlord premiered off-Broadway at the New York Theatre Workshop on November 4, 2021. The production was directed by Chay Yew, and was streamed virtually for purchase.\n\nWest Coast Productions (2022–2023)\nThe show made its West Coast premiere at La Jolla Playhouse's Potiker Theatre on September 20, 2022. Wong later brought the play to Portland Center Stage beginning in November 2022 and performed at Center Theatre Group's Kirk Douglas Theatre beginning in February 2023.\n\nReception\nThe show has received positive reviews. Laura Collins-Hughes of The New York Times declared it a Critics Pick, describing the show as a \"spiky comic tonic\". In a review of Center Theatre Group's production of the show in Los Angeles, critic Charles McNulty of the Los Angeles Times praised Wong's performance as being full of \"vibrant, wacky, lovably chaotic immediacy\".\n\nAwards and nominations\nReferences\nExternal links\nKristina Wong, Sweatshop Overlord at the Internet Off-Broadway Database (archived)",

    "title": "1938 Cincinnati Reds season",
    "text": "The 1938 Cincinnati Reds season was a season in American baseball. The team finished fourth in the National League with a record of 82–68, 6 games behind the Chicago Cubs.\n\nOffseason\nDuring the off-season, Cincinnati hired Bill McKechnie to manage the club. McKechnie had extensive major league experience as a manager, as he most recently managed the Boston Bees from 1930 to 1937, leading the club to a 560–666 over eight seasons. McKechnie also managed the St. Louis Cardinals from 1928 to 1929, leading the team to a 129–88 record and winning the 1928 National League pennant. McKechnie had his most success as manager with the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1922 to 1926, as he earned a 409–293 record. McKechnie managed the Pirates to the 1925 National League pennant, and won the 1925 World Series as Pittsburgh defeated the Washington Senators in seven games.\nOn October 4, 1937, the Reds released outfielder Kiki Cuyler following the 1937 season. Cuyler spent three seasons in Cincinnati, where he batted .293 with nine home runs, 128 RBI and 30 stolen bases in 323 games.\nThe Reds sold centerfielder Hub Walker to the Nashville Volunteers of the Southern Association on December 2. In 78 games with the Reds in 1937, Walker hit .249 with one home run and 19 RBI.\nThe next day, on December 3, the Reds were involved in a trade with the New York Yankees. Cincinnati sent shortstop Eddie Miller and $40,000 to New York for catcher Willard Hershberger. Hershberger batted .325 with five home runs in 96 games with the Newark Bears of the International League during the 1937 season. Following the acquisition of Hershberger, the Reds sold catcher Gilly Campbell to the Montreal Royals of the International League three days later.\nOn February 3, the Reds released pitcher Bill Hallahan. Hallahan struggled to a 3–9 record with a 6.14 ERA in 21 games with the Reds during the 1937 season.\nThe next day, on February 4, Cincinnati purchased second baseman Lonny Frey from the Chicago Cubs. Frey hit .278 with one home run and 22 RBI in 78 games during his only season with Chicago. Previously, Frey played with the Brooklyn Dodgers from 1933 to 1936, where in his best season in 1935, Frey hit .262 with 11 home runs and 77 RBI in 131 games.\nIn mid-April, the Reds signed pitcher Ray Benge as a free agent. Benge did not play during the 1937 season. In the 1936 season, he earned a record of 8–13 with a 5.49 ERA in 36 games while splitting the season between the Boston Bees and the Philadelphia Phillies. In 1931, Benge enjoyed his best season, as he earned a 14–18 record with a 3.17 ERA in 38 games with the Phillies.\n\nRegular season\nOn April 19, the Reds opened the 1938 season with a loss to the Chicago Cubs by a score of 8–7 in front of 34,148 fans at Crosley Field. Ernie Lombardi went 3-for-3 for the Reds, while Billy Myers went 3-for-4, while driving in three runs.\nThe Reds purchased pitcher Jim Weaver from the St. Louis Browns on April 25. Weaver had a 0–1 record with an ERA of 9.00 in one game with the Browns. In 1935 with the Pittsburgh Pirates, Weaver finished tied for the National League lead with four shutouts.\nFollowing a 3–8 start of the season in their first 11 games, Cincinnati would win six of their next seven games, bringing their record to .500 at 9–9 through 18 games. The Reds would stay hot throughout the month of May, as the club finished the month with a record of 15–9, which brought their overall win-loss record to 19–17 heading into June, as the club sat in fourth place in the National League.\nOn June 6, the Reds acquired outfielder Wally Berger from the New York Giants in exchange for infielder Alex Kampouris. Berger struggled with the Giants in 1938, hitting only .188 with four RBI in 16 games. Earlier in his career, Berger was one of the top sluggers in the National League. In 1930, he set the record for most home runs by a rookie with 38 when he played for the Boston Braves. In the 1933 season, Berger finished in third place in National League MVP voting after he hit .313 with 27 home runs and 106 RBI in 137 games with the Braves. In 1935, Berger led the National League with 34 home runs and 130 RBI.\nJohnny Vander Meer became the only pitcher in major league history to pitch two consecutive no-hitters in 1938.  On June 11, 1938, he no-hit the Boston Bees at Crosley Field. Four nights later, in the first night game played at Ebbets Field, he no-hit the Brooklyn Dodgers. One of two balls that survives from this historic game is in the Seth Swirsky collection. After his double no-hit achievement, Reds' management wanted Vander Meer to change his uniform number to \"00.\" He politely refused.\nOn June 13, the Reds were involved in a blockbuster trade, as the team acquired pitcher Bucky Walters from the Philadelphia Phillies in exchange for catcher Spud Davis, pitcher Al Hollingsworth and $50,000. Walters struggled to begin the 1938 season with the Phillies, posting a record of 4–8 with a 5.23 ERA in 12 starts, pitching 82.2 innings and nine complete games.\nCincinnati had a very solid record of 15–10 in the month of June, bringing their overall win-loss record to 35–27 by the end of the month, sitting in a second place tie with the Pittsburgh Pirates, only four games behind the pennant leading New York Giants.\nThe Reds started off the month of July with a four-game losing streak, which dropped the team into fourth place in the National League and eight games behind the Giants. Cincinnati rebounded from this streak, winning their next seven games, however, the streaky Reds then dropped four games in a row following their winning streak. Overall, Cincinnati had a 15–15 record during the month, as their overall record was 50–42 by the end of July, as they were in fourth place, 8.5 games out of first.\nCincinnati put together a record of 18–14 during the month of August, bumping the club from fourth place into second by the end of the month with an overall record of 68–56, however, the Reds sat 6.5 games behind the pennant leading Pittsburgh Pirates.\nThe Reds were never able to catch New York for first place, as the team put together a record of 14–12 in their remaining 26 games, dropping the Reds to fourth place in the National League, as Cincinnati finished six games behind the pennant winning Chicago Cubs.\nOffensively, outfield Ival Goodman led the club, as he hit .292 with a team leading 30 home runs, and drove in 92 runners in 145 games. Catcher Ernie Lombardi led Cincinnati with a .342 batting average, while he hit 19 home runs and had 95 RBI in 129 games. First baseman Frank McCormick led the Reds with 109 RBI, as he hit .327 and had five home runs in 151 games played. Outfielder Wally Berger, who the Reds acquired in a trade during the season, hit .306 with 16 home runs and 56 RBI in 99 games with the Reds.\nThe Reds pitching staff was anchored by Paul Derringer, as he led the club with a 21–14 record and a 2.93 ERA in 41 games. Derringer led Cincinnati with 26 complete games, four shutouts, 307 innings pitched, and struck out 132 batters. Johnny Vander Meer had an unforgettable season, throwing back-to-back no-hitters. He posted a record of 15–10 with a 3.12 ERA in 32 games. Bucky Walters posted a record of 11–6 and an ERA of 3.69 in 168.1 innings pitched following his trade to Cincinnati during the season.\nThe Reds 82–68 record in 1938 was a 26 win improvement over the 1937 season, in which the club finished in last place with a 56–98 record. The 1938 season was the first time Cincinnati finished over .500 since the 1928 season, when the club finished 78–74. The Reds 82 victories was their highest total since the 1926 season, when the Reds finished 87–67. Cincinnati set a club record in attendance, as the team drew 706,756 fans, an improvement of 295,535 from 1937. The Reds previously record high for attendance was in 1926 as the club drew 672,987 fans.\n\nSeason standings\nRecord vs. opponents\nRoster\nPlayer stats\nBatting\nStarters by position\nNote: Pos = Position; G = Games played; AB = At bats; H = Hits; Avg. = Batting average; HR = Home runs; RBI = Runs batted in\n\nOther batters\nNote: G = Games played; AB = At bats; H = Hits; Avg. = Batting average; HR = Home runs; RBI = Runs batted in\n\nPitching\nStarting pitchers\nNote: G = Games pitched; IP = Innings pitched; W = Wins; L = Losses; ERA = Earned run average; SO = Strikeouts\n\nOther pitchers\nNote: G = Games pitched; IP = Innings pitched; W = Wins; L = Losses; ERA = Earned run average; SO = Strikeouts\n\nRelief pitchers\nNote: G = Games pitched; W = Wins; L = Losses; SV = Saves; ERA = Earned run average; SO = Strikeouts\n\nFarm system\nReferences\nExternal links\n1938 Cincinnati Reds season at Baseball Reference",

    "title": "The Seven Minutes (film)",
    "text": "The Seven Minutes is a 1971 American legal drama film directed and produced by Russ Meyer. The movie was based on the 1969 novel of the same name by Irving Wallace.\n\nPlot\nAfter a teenager, Jerry Griffith (John Sarno), who purchased the erotic novel The Seven Minutes is charged with rape, an eager prosecutor who is against pornography (and preparing for an upcoming election) uses the scandal to declare the book as obscene, sets up a sting operation where two detectives enter a bookstore and purchase a copy of the eponymous book, then the prosecutor brings charges against the bookstore for selling obscene material. The trial soon creates a heated debate about the issue of pornography vs. free speech. The young defense lawyer, Mike Barrett, must also solve the mystery of the novel's true author.\nIn examining the history of the book, the defense attorney discovered it was written by J.J. Jadway, an American expatriate living in Europe.  The book was originally published in English by a publisher in France, and eventually picked up by various tawdry publishing companies in the United States, most of whom tried to emphasize the more lurid and salacious aspects of the book. Its content was considered so sexually explicit that it was banned as obscene in over 30 countries. Apparently. J.J. Jadway was so despondent over the treatment of his book that he committed suicide; one of his friends found him and reported it.\nAs the trial takes place, the prosecutor finds ordinary members of the public who find the book grossly offensive (one of whom admits on cross-examination by the defense that she cannot even repeat out loud one of the words used in the book to describe what the female protagonist was doing in bed with her lover), and the defense finds professionals in academia and the media who attest to the book's value as literature. The prosecution then puts the young man who committed the rape on the stand to say the book drove him to it.\nThe attorney defending the book is contacted by Constance Cumberland, a member of a local decency society who decides to testify in court about the young man who committed the rape and other things surrounding the book. She had spoken with the young man, and his motivation for the rape was not the book, but his own fears over his sexuality.\nConstance also admits that she knew J.J. Jadway, the book's author, that he did not die of a heart attack in Europe in the 1950s as was reported, and that she knew that the book's content was not intended to be pornographic but rather an examination of a woman's sexuality.\nWhen she is asked how she could know this, Constance responds with a bombshell, \"Because I am J.J. Jadway, and I wrote The Seven Minutes.\" She had asked a friend to publicize the fake suicide of J.J. Jadway in order to discourage investigation into the book's author because, more than 20 years ago, it would have been bad for her if it were discovered she was the author, but she should not hide any longer. She proceeds to explain that the man with whom the female protagonist of the novel was having sex, as the book showed, had had problems with impotence, and had become able to experience intercourse because of her. Her feeling of what this man reawakened in her, having not taken a lover for many years, makes her realize she wants to be with him – all of this occurring inside her head during her experience of the seven minutes of intercourse.\nThe jury finds the book not obscene. The prosecutor says that decision only applies in that part of the state, and he can try again somewhere else in California. The attorney who won the case chastises him, pointing out that it is ridiculous to try to restrict what adults choose to read in their homes when no harm has been shown (as it was in this case, since the book was simply a scapegoat used to explain away the case of alleged rape by the young man.)\nA note at the end of the movie states that for a woman during a session of lovemaking, the average length of time from initial arousal to orgasm is about seven minutes.\n\nCast\nWayne Maunder as Mike Barrett\nMarianne McAndrew as Maggie Russell\nPhilip Carey as Elmo Duncan\nJay C. Flippen as Luther Yerkes\nEdy Williams as Faye Osborn\nLyle Bettger as Frank Griffith\nYvonne De Carlo as Constance Cumberland\nJackie Gayle as Norman Quandt\nRon Randell as Merle Reid\nCharles Drake as Sergeant Kellogg\nJohn Carradine as Sean O'Flanagan\nHarold J.

The first of these was The Plot. The second was The Seven Minutes, which he finished in 1968.\nIn June 1969, Fox announced it would make the movie in the next 18 months. It would be produced and directed by Richard Fleischer.\nThe book came out in October 1969 and became a best seller. The New York Times called it \"impossible to put down.\"\n\nRuss Meyer\nFleischer withdrew, and the movie was assigned to Russ Meyer, who had directed Beyond the Valley of the Dolls for Fox. Fox was happy with the movie and signed a contract with Meyer to make three more movies: The Seven Minutes, from a novel by Irving Wallace; Everything in the Garden from a play by Edward Albee; and The Final Steal from a 1966 novel by Peter George. \"We've discovered that he's very talented and cost conscious\", said Fox president Richard Zanuck. \"He can put his finger on the commercial ingredients of a film and do it exceedingly well. We feel he can do more than undress people.\"\nMeyer later said of his time at Fox, \"I made the mistake of acquiring a big fat head while I was there. I was flush with victory from Vixen, Cherry, Harry and Raquel, and BVD. They told me, \"You must do The Seven Minutes. You are the spokesperson against the forces of censorship.\" And Irving Wallace sits there with this profound look. They gave me $2.7 million for the film, but no tits and ass... I had another property I should have done instead. But Brown gave me the blue smoke up my ass. So I did it.\"\n\"Russ is trying to do something different for him\", said Wallace. \"As far as I can tell it will not be a skinflick and at least for most of it the movie will follow the line of my novel.\"\n\nCasting\n\"We're casting it much like an English movie\", said Meyer. \"We're really paying attention to the vignettes.\"\nAs with many of his movies, Meyer used several actors from his previous productions, including then-wife Edy Williams, Charles Napier, Henry Rowland and James Iglehart. Established actress Yvonne De Carlo makes an appearance along with veteran character actor Olan Soule. Tom Selleck also had a role in the movie, and DJ Wolfman Jack made a cameo.\nKnown as \"King of the Nudies\" for his work in the sexploitation film genre, Meyer planned nude scenes in this mainstream film. He informed female lead candidates that nudity would be integral to their roles, and after casting interviews, considered Marianne McAndrew to be suitable. He subsequently signed her for the lead role of Maggie Russell. McAndrew, previously known for her work as the prim and proper Irene Molloy in Hello, Dolly!, accepted the role based upon her wish to change her own image and in order to gain more work within the industry. She reported that during the filming, Meyer was \"considerate and gentlemanly\".\nRon Randell had a small role.\n\nShooting\nWallace requested Meyer use Picassos from his personal collection in the movie.\nFilming started 14 October 1970.\nMeyer said it was \"a very wordy picture\" so he used rapid cutting.\nWhile the movie was being made Richard Zanuck was fired as head of production and was replaced by Elmo Williams. Williams said Seven Minutes was \"going to be a very interesting film. I was worried after the first cut but Russ handled the sex extremely well. When I saw the first half I was going to ask him to slow the picture down. And it's rare for me to ask a guy to slow a picture down. I mean, so people could understand the story better. But when I saw the whole film with the second half – the trial – I understood what he was doing...I've never seen a good trial in a film – a trial that isn't slow, isn't boring.\"\n\nSoundtrack\nThe music was composed by Stu Phillips.\nThe soundtrack contains three songs written by Stu Phillips (composer) and Bob Stone (lyricist): \"Love Train\" sung by Don Reed, \"The Seven Minutes\" performed by B.B. King and \"Midnight Tricks\" sung by Neil Merryweather and Lynn Carey.\n\nReception\nMeyer later said \"The first night in every theater was packed. And the next night: three people. Why? The audience knows...It was a good film. But attaching my name to that film was a bummer. It does a great disservice to everyone concerned.\"\nThe Seven Minutes received a lukewarm reception from critics and was a rare commercial failure for Meyer.\nMeyer later said, \"I made the mistake of reading my reviews. What the public wants are big laughs and big tits and lots of ‘em. Lucky for me that's what I like, too.\"\n\"It was boring and tedious\", he said in 1975. \"I should never have taken it on. Message pictures are never successful. This one had too much courtroom and not enough he-ing and she-ing.\"\nRoger Ebert later said the movie \"was unsuited to Meyer's strongest points, which are eroticism, action and parody in about equal doses. The Seven minutes was intended as a serious consideration of pornography and censorship and, alas, that is the way Meyer approached it. He got serious about the theme. He had been harassed for years by various amateur and professional vigilantes, and intended The Seven Minutes as his statement against censorship. The result, whatever it was, was not a Russ Meyer film in the classical vein.\"\nEbert admitted there were some nice touches like making a U.S. Senator from California a woman played by Yvonne De Carlo \"but Meyer's main thrust seemed to be to bring The Seven Minutes to the screen more or less faithfully and seriously, and I think that was a mistake. The courtroom scenes and philosophical discussions clashed with the melodrama (as they also do in the Irving Wallace novel), and the result was a film of a project that should probably not have been made at all, and certainly not by Russ Meyer.\"\n\nCritical\nThe New York Times' reviewer Roger Greenspun wrote \"I don't think that a court of law is the right Russ Meyer arena, and The Seven Minutes, which had started out pretty well, bogs down hopelessly in its courtroom legalisms and its absolutely non-cliff-hanging rush to unearth the real identity of the mythical J.J. Jadway\", citing some problems with the movie's complicated plot and \"enormous cast of characters\". In addressing the movie's use of nudity, he wrote \"[Meyer] has never been so much concerned with undressing his girls (there are maybe five seconds of nudity in \"The Seven Minutes\") as admiring their appetites, their overwhelming proportions (but not so much their seductive flesh), their often destructive and self-destructive wills.\"\nVariety wrote that Irving Wallace's original novel was a \"potboiler\" \"which averted the essence of the problem in resolving the story\", and noted that Russ Meyer was a \"censor-exploited as well as a censor-exploiting filmmaker\", who began with a story handicap and added a few of his own. They expanded that Meyer used \"cardboard-caricatures of his heavies\" which obscured issues, and included the \"regular time-out for the sexually-liberated dalliances which have been his stock in trade.\"\nWriting for Filmink, Stephen Vagg declared \"I think I’m the only person in the world who likes The Seven Minutes – I find it an entertaining, fast paced courtroom drama which deals with interesting issues, which is well directed and acted.\"\n\nSee also\nList of American films of 1971\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nThe Seven Minutes at IMDb\nThe Seven Minutes at Rotten Tomatoes\nThe Seven Minutes at the TCM Movie Database (archived version)",

    "title": "Vanderstock v Victoria",
    "text": "Vanderstock v Victoria is a High Court of Australia case concerning excise. A charge imposed by the state of Victoria on zero and low emission vehicles (ZLEVs) was ruled invalid on the grounds that it imposed a duty of excise as defined by Section 90 of the Constitution. It overruled Dickenson's Arcade Pty Ltd v Tasmania, and imposed a broad view of an excise as defined by Section 90.\n\nFacts\nThe Zero and Low Emission Vehicle Distance-based Charge Act 2021, which came into effect on 1 July 2021, imposed a charge on the use of electric, hydrogen, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (collectively referred to as ZLEVs) on Victorian roads. The charge was 2.5 cents per kilometre for electric and hydrogen vehicles, and 2.0 cents per kilometre for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. The charge was introduced to ensure ZLEV owners paid for the maintenance of the road network, as ZLEVs would not be subject to the fuel excise.\nIn September of 2021, Melbourne ZLEV drivers Chris Vanderstock and Kathleen Davies, represented by Equity Generation Lawyers, launched a challenge against the constitutional validity of the law, arguing that the Victorian law created a tax of consumption on ZLEVs, which would be a duty of excise and exclusive to the Commonwealth under Section 90 of the Constitution.\n\nDecision\nA narrow majority of the Court, consisting of Kiefel CJ, and Gageler, Gleeson, and Jagot JJs, ruled in favour of Vanderstock, deciding that the charge on ZLEVs constituted an excise as defined by Section 90 of the Constitution, and was therefore beyond the state of Victoria's constitutional powers. The majority ruled that Dickenson's Arcade Pty Ltd v Tasmania, which held that a tax on goods at the stage of consumption did not constitute an excise, should be reopened and overruled. Kiefel CJ, Gageler, and Gleeson JJs found that the nature of Victoria's ZLEV charge would inherently \"dampen demand\" for ZLEVs, as the charge applied to almost all uses of ZLEVs on Victorian roads, and therefore the Victorian charge was a tax and a duty of excise.\nJagot J, concurring with the Court's ruling, agreed that the Victorian ZLEV charge was a tax, and thus could not be imposed on the state level, distinguishing it from a \"fee for service\", such as a license or permit fee.\nGordon, Edelman, and Steward JJs all disagreed with the Court's opinion, authoring separate dissents. Gordon J argued that the majority's ruling \"amends the Constitution\", by redefining a \"duty of excise\" in Section 90 to refer to any tax on goods, and argued that the Victorian ZLEV charge, while serving as a tax on the consumption of goods, did not affect the production, manufacture, or commerce of ZLEVs. \nEdelman J wrote that the definition of excise that the majority had adopted had no basis in past rulings, serving as a \"neglect of precedent\". He believed that the Victorian charge was not a consumption tax, and aimed to have the same effect as a fuel excise. However, he stated that the ZLEV charge differed from a fuel excise in that it was not levied at the point of sale. Edelman J argued that the ZLEV charge was \"unlikely to have any real and substantial effect\" on demand for ZLEVs.\nSteward J disagreed with the Court's view that the ZLEV charge was a tax on goods and therefore an excise, writing that the charge had \"the character of a direct tax\". He argued that, even if it was to be assumed that the ZLEV charge was a consumption tax, such a tax would not fall under the definition of an excise. All three dissenting justices agreed that Dickenson's Arcade should not have been reopened.\n\nReaction\nPlaintiffs Vanderstock and Davies welcomed the Court's ruling, stating that Victoria's ZLEV charge had disincentivised the purchase of ZLEVs and unfairly punished ZLEV drivers. Upon the announcement of the Court's ruling, the Victorian Greens and Victorian shadow treasurer Brad Rowswell called upon the Victorian government to repay charges claimed under the Zero and Low Emission Vehicle Distance-based Charge Act 2021.\nThe Court's ruling was immediately noted to have severely effected the vertical fiscal imbalance between the Commonwealth and the states. Similar charges planned to be introduced by New South Wales and Western Australia were likely prohibited, and the constitutionality of other state-imposed road user charges, such as motor vehicle duties and vehicle registration charges, could be brought into question. Every state and territory government had submitted in support of Victoria in the case.\nVictorian treasurer Tim Pallas argued that the Court had redefined an excise to mean \"a tax on anything\", suggesting that other state charges could be challenged under the Court's ruling. He emphasised the need to \"secure the state’s revenue base\" through legislative changes and collaboration with the Commonwealth. New South Wales Premier Chris Minns stated that the decision in Vanderstock had \"caught everyone off guard\", adding that the funding of future road projects in New South Wales may have to be re-examined due to the state's reliance on road user charges.\nPallas announced in November 2023 that the ZLEV charges imposed would be repaid with interest, amounting to an approximate A$7 million repayment to ZLEV owners.\n\nSee also\nSection 90 of the Constitution of Australia\nAustralian constitutional law\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n[2023] HCA 30 (Vanderstock v Victoria) - Judgement",

    "title": "Rear flank downdraft",
    "text": "The rear flank downdraft (RFD) is a region of dry air wrapping around the back of a mesocyclone in a supercell thunderstorm. These areas of descending air are thought to be essential in the production of many supercellular tornadoes.  Large hail within the rear flank downdraft often shows up brightly as a hook on weather radar images, producing the characteristic hook echo, which often indicates the presence of a tornado.\n\nFormation\nThe rear flank downdraft can arise owing to negative buoyancy, which can be generated by cold anomalies produced at the rear of the supercell thunderstorm by evaporative cooling of precipitation or hail melting, or injection of dry and cooler air in the cloud, and by vertical perturbation pressure gradients that can arise from vertical gradients of vertical vorticity, stagnation of environmental flow at an updraft, and pressure perturbations due to vertical buoyancy variations (which are partially due to hydrostatic effects).\nVertical pressure perturbations are generated by the buildup of pressure due to the vertical buoyancy, creating a pressure perturbation gradient. The subsiding air is generally dry and as it subsides the air warms adiabatically and can form a clearing in the cloud cover called a clear slot. A clear slot can be observed to wrap around a tornado or form away from a tornado in the shape of a horseshoe. This clearing is most likely the formation of the hook echo region associated with tornado formation. An RFD originating in dry air warming adiabatically can produce warmer observations out of the RFD at the surface.\n\nThermodynamic characteristics\nRFDs may present themselves as a clear slot wrapping itself at least two-thirds of the way around the tornado, but the clear slot is not always evident in cases where an RFD is present. Many documents indicate that surface pressure excesses up to a few millibars exist within RFDs. Some findings showed that within the RFDs equivalent potential temperature (θe) is cold with respect to the inflow. Moreover, the lowest wet-bulb potential temperature (θw) values observed at the surface were within the RFD. There are, however, also observations of warm, high-θe air within RFDs.\n\nDifference from forward flank downdraft\nCompared to the forward flank downdraft (FFD) the rear flank downdraft (RFD) consists of warm and dry air. This is because the RFD is forced down from the mid-levels of the atmosphere, resulting in compressional heating of downward moving parcels. The FFD, in contrast, is driven by precipitation loading and evaporative cooling in the precipitation core of a supercell thunderstorm, making the FFD relatively cold and wet. Both are thought to be significant in tornado formation.\n\nRole in tornadogenesis\nAssociation with hook echo\nRear-flank downdrafts have a well-established association with hook echoes. Firstly, the initial rear flank downdraft is air from aloft transported down to the surface by colliding and mixing with the storm. Secondly, hook echoes form through advection of precipitation from the rear of the main echo around the region of strong updraft. Thus, precipitation loading and evaporation cooling induced by the hook echo can enhance the downdraft. Some observations showed the presence of an enhanced downdraft in the vicinity of the strongest low-level rotation, behind the main storm updraft.\nDry environmental air is also entrained into the downdraft and evaporative cooling helps create more negatively buoyant air. As precipitation falls and cool entrained air circulated downward and eventually reaching the surface. This contributes to the circulation to form a hook echo. It was concluded the presence of a hook echo can reflect downdraft intensification.\n\nAssociation with tornadoes\nMany researchers have realized that rear flank downdrafts, especially those associated with hook echoes, are fundamentally critical to tornado formation (tornadogenesis). In 1975, Ted Fujita originated the recycling hypothesis of tornadogenesis: First, downdraft air is recirculated into the (developing) tornado, which results in an appreciable convergence on the back side of the (still developing) tornado. Then the downward transport of the angular momentum by precipitation, and the recycling of air into the tornado, will create a tangential acceleration required for the intensification of the tornado as a positive feedback loop.\nObservations of low-level vorticity couplets within RFDs indicate that tilting of vorticity by the RFD is important in the formation of tornadoes within supercell storms. During the tornadogenesis phase in supercells, the parcels of air infiltrating the tornado or incipient tornado regularly seem to pass through the hook echo and RFD, which can serve as the basis for Fujita's recycling hypothesis. Furthermore, observations of the clear slot during and just prior to the tornadic stage, imply the air infiltrating the tornado may come from the RFD.\nRegularly, generation of large vertical vorticity close to the surface in an environment which is required for tornadogenesis, is attributed to downdraft. Tornadoes may arise, however, in the absence of a downdraft in environments containing preexisting vertical vorticity at the surface, such as in some cases of nonsupercell tornadogenesis.\nDowndraft may have the following roles in near-ground mesocyclogenesis: \n\ntilts horizontal vorticity to produce vertical vorticity\ntransports air containing vertical vorticity from mid-level to the surface\nenhances the near-ground vorticity convergence beneath the updraft tremendously by entering the updraft and stretching vertically\n\nSee also\nHook echo\nSupercell\nThunderstorm\nTornado\nVertical draft\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nWallace; Hobbs (2006).

    "text": "The Wilbur Fiske Haven House is a historic house at 339 Pleasant Street in Malden, Massachusetts. Built in the 1860s, this Second Empire house is a remnant survivor of a series of fashionable mid-19th century Victorian houses, known as \"Doctor's Row\". The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. It is now used for professional offices.\n\nDescription and history\nThe Haven House is set on the north side of Pleasant Street, just west of the Malden Center MBTA station. Its historic position was at the head of a series of similar houses along Pleasant Street, which is now lined mainly with commercial buildings. The house is a 2+1⁄2-story wood-frame structure, topped with a slate mansard roof and resting on a granite foundation. The roof is pierced in several places by round-arch dormers, including a doubled one above the main entrance. The walls are finished in flushboard, with quoined corners. The front facade is three bays wide, with the central bay covered by a projecting glassed-in porch two stories in height. The flanking bays each have a projecting bay window on the first floor. Roof lines of the main roof, porch, and bays are dentillated and studded with brackets. An addition to the building, made during its 1989 restoration, was done in a stylistically sensitive way.\nThe house was built for Wilbur Fiske Haven, a Boston hardware merchant, during a period of growth in Malden center occasioned by the arrival of the railroad. A later resident was William Ferguson, a railroad contractor who laid miles of track in Malden and adjacent towns. In the early 1900s a large number of doctors lived in the area, including in this house, leading the neighborhood to be dubbed \"Doctor's Row\". The house was repurposes as a funeral home in 1929, and has most recently housed professional offices.\n\nSee also\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Middlesex County, Massachusetts\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "List of English words of Etruscan origin",
    "text": "This is a list of English words that may be of Etruscan origin, and were borrowed through Latin, often via French. The Etruscan origin of most of these words is disputed, and some may be of Indo-European or other origin. The question is made more complex by the fact that the Etruscans borrowed many Greek words in modified form. Typically if a Latin word has an unknown, uncertain or disputed origin, it is considered a possible candidate for deriving in whole or in part from an Etruscan word; however, native Etruscan must then be distinguished from Greek. If no Etruscan word is clearly identifiable sometimes an attempt is made to reconstruct one. Etruscan derivations therefore are highly variable in probability; that is, some are highly speculative and others more likely.\n\nList\nace\nfrom Middle English aas, from Old French as, from Latin as, \"a whole, a unit, copper coin\", possibly Etruscan. As was a Roman coin and was also a unit of weight equal to about one troy pound.\nantenna\nfrom antenna < antemna, \"yard-arm, sail\". Possibly Etruscan *antithemna > *ant(th)emna from Greek ἀνατιθέμενος anatithémenos, something set up.\nAnthony\nfrom Latin  Antōnius, a Roman gens claimed by Marcus Antonius to descend from  Ἄντων (Ántōn), a son of Heracles, but the gens is probably Etruscan in origin, most likely derived from Ani, the Etruscan god of the sky. Previous claims asserted an Ancient Greek (compare ἄνθος ánthos, “flower” or ἄνθρωπος, \"man, human\") origin with an unetymological excrescent -h- but this remains dubious.\nApril\nLatin aprilis probably from Etruscan form apera- (found the Tabula Capuana, a ritual calendar line 8--the next section mentions May anpile), which form may come from Greek Aphrodite. There is also a gloss that equates Etruscan <c>Abreus with Latin Aprilis mensis.\narena\nfrom arēna \"arena\" < harēna, \"arena, sand\" < archaic hasēna < Sabine fasēna, unknown Etruscan word as the basis for fas- with Etruscan ending -ēna.\natrium\nFrom Latin atrium which both Breyer and Bonfante consider to be a likely loan from Etruscan (along with other architectural terms such as fenestra \"window\" and cella \"chamber\"). But both Watkins and de Vaan trace it back to Proto-Indo-European (though they disagree on the exact root).\nautumn\nfrom autumnus \"autumn\". Just as Etruscan veltha, an earth god, appears as Latin Vola or Olta and is in Voltumna and Vertumnus, so the parallel construction autumnus ought to come from Etruscan autu-, related to avil, \"year\": *av(i)-to-m(e)nos, with loss of the l. There are some names with both l and t: avlethaium, authnal, avtle, and so on, which appear related to autu or auta in Venetic, the idea being that autumn signifies the passing of the year.\nbelt\nfrom balteus, \"sword belt.\" The sole connection between this word and Etruscan is a statement by Marcus Terentius Varro that it was of Etruscan origin. All else is speculation.\ncatamite\nLatin, from Etruscan catmite, from the Ancient Greek Ganymede, cupbearer to Zeus. Bonfante and most others accept this etymology.\nceremony\npossibly Etruscan or possibly referring to Etruscan rites performed at Caere.\ndefenestration, fenestra\nBoth Bonfante and Whatmough accept the probability that Latin fenestra was a loan from a derivative of Etruscan fnes-. Some of the other reasonably certain loans also deal with elements of architecture, for example atrium and cella.\nelement\nfrom elementum, 'letter'.\nhistrionic\nfrom histrionicus, from histrio, \"actor\".\nletter\nfrom Old French lettre, from Latin littera, which may have derived, via Etruscan, from the Greek \"διφθέρα\" (writing tablet).\nmantissa\n\nmarket\n\nmilitary\nEtruscan or perhaps related to Greek homilos, \"assembled crowd\" (compare homily).\nmundane\nfrom mundus, 'earth', from munth, 'land'.\nmutule\n\npalace, palate, palatine\nOne of the seven hills of Rome.  Either from Latin palus \"stake\" or the Etruscan shepherd goddess Pales.\npeople\nFrom Latin populus by way of Old French peuple, possibly of Etruscan origin. After a lengthy discussion, Whatmough concludes that it is not completely certain that Latin populus is an Etruscan loanword, but that such an etymology is \"satisfactory at the morphological and phonological levels.\"\nperson\nfrom Middle English persone, from Old French persone, from Latin persona, \"mask\", probably from Etruscan phersu, \"mask\". Another sources, however, links the Etruscan word as a derivative of Greek πρὀσωπον prosōpon, \"mask\".\nRome\nfrom 'Ruma', the name of one of the Etruscan tribes, or 'Rumon', which was what the Etruscans called the Tiber River, possibly of Etruscan origin as ruma was one of the Etruscan gentes, from rum, “teat”.\nsatellite\nfrom Latin satelles, meaning \"bodyguard, attendant\", perhaps from Etruscan satnal. Bonfante, otherwise quite skeptical of many proposed loans, calls it \"quite likely\" that Latin satteles is from Etruscan. Whatmough considers Latin satteles \"as one of our securest Etruscan loans in Latin.\"\nscurrilous\n\nSerge (first name)\nserve\nthe word serve derives from Latin servire ('to serve') and servus ('a slave'), which have sometimes been thought to derive from Etruscan. However, a detailed analysis has preferred an Indo-European etymology for the Latin word.\nspurious\nFrom Latin spurius \"born out of wedlock, illegitimate\" from Etruscan spur-al \"of the city\" because, as Pisani proposed, children not claimed by their fathers were considered to belong to the city. Whatmough, however, rejects Pisani's claim, both because of the late attestation of the Latin term, but also because the Etruscan root spur is now seen as meaning \"community\" not \"city\"; and furthermore, in any case, the form that would have to be the immediate predecessor of Latin spurius would have to be Etruscan spurie which may have a different meaning, and in one instance seems to be the name of a person with a named father.\ntriumph\nFrom Old Latin triumpus, probably a loan word via Etruscan from Greek thriambos, a hymn to Dionysus.\nvernacular\nfrom vernaculus, 'domestic', from verna, 'a native slave'.\nviburnum\nfrom Latin viburnum, likely Etruscan in origin. Compare laburnum, alaternus, basterna, lacerna, santerna, pincerna, clarnus, all strongly suspected to be derived from Etruscan or related languages.\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nBreyer, Gertraud (1993).

Brink started on the pitch, but was replaced by Lasse Rise in the 62nd minute in a 1–0 victory against Viborg FF in the Danish Superliga. A few days later, he extended his contract until 2019.\nAfter an individual successful period, his contract was extended once again in April 2017 until 2021.\nOn 25 July 2019, Brink made his European debut, starting in a 2–0 away loss to Belarusian club Shakhtyor Soligorsk in the second qualifying round of the UEFA Europa League.\n\nSilkeborg\nOn transfer deadline day, 31 January 2020, Brink joined Silkeborg IF on a three-year contract.\nHe made his competitive debut for the club on 16 February, replacing Vegard Moberg in the 84th minute of a 2–0 home loss to AaB. Silkeborg suffered relegation to the Danish 1st Division at the end of the 2019–20 season, bottom of the league.\nOn 11 September 2020, Brink scored his first goal for Silkeborg in the 92nd minute of a 4–2 away loss to FC Helsingør on the first matchday of the 2020–21 Danish 1st Division. Silkeborg bounced back to the Danish Superliga that season, finishing second in the league with Brink as a starter. He made 29 appearances, scoring the one goal.\nWith Brink as one of the key players in midfield, Silkeborg was one of the positive surprises of the 2021–22 season, impressing with an attacking and entertaining style of play under head coach Kent Nielsen. Due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, all Russian teams were excluded from European tournaments by UEFA. This meant that the Danish Cup winners entered the final qualifying round for the UEFA Europa League. When FC Midtjylland won the 2021–22 Danish Cup, and at the same time finished in second place in the Superliga, which now gave access to UEFA Champions League qualification, Silkeborg secured Europa League qualification by virtue of their third-place Superliga finish. Brink finished the season with 34 appearances in which he scored one goal.\n\nNordsjælland\nOn 2 September 2024, Nordsjælland announced the signing of Brink on a contract until June 2027.\n\nCareer statistics\nAs of match played 7 December 2025\n\nHonours\nSilkeborg\n\nDanish Cup: 2023–24\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nMark Brink national team profile at the Danish Football Association (in Danish) \nMark Brink at Soccerway.com\nMark Brink at WorldFootball.net\nMark Brink at FBref.com\nMark Brink at kicker (in German)",

    "title": "John D. Goeken",
    "text": "John D. \"Jack\" Goeken (August 22, 1930 – September 16, 2010) was an American telecommunications entrepreneur. Goeken founded multiple communications companies, often pursuing innovative technologies despite significant skepticism and resistance. He was the founder of Microwave Communications Inc. in the early 1960s, initially established to support the sale of two-way radios. The company would go on to play a major role in transforming the U.S. telecommunications industry by introducing lower-cost long-distance telephone service for consumers and businesses. Other ventures included Airfone and In-Flight Phone, which were instrumental in developing air-to-ground telephone systems, as well as the digital network later adopted by FTD florists.\n\nEarly life and education\nJohn D. Goeken was born on August 22, 1930, in Joliet, Illinois. His father was a Lutheran minister.\n\nCareer\nMCI Communications\nGoeken founded his company, originally named Microwave Communications Inc., after leaving the Army, where he had gained experience with microwave technology. At the time, truckers traveling between Chicago and St. Louis were unable to use two-way radios over long distances due to limited signal range. Goeken addressed this by building a network of microwave towers along the route to relay signals.\nThe company faced opposition from established telecommunications firms, which filed challenges with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Despite this, the FCC granted MCI the right to compete with AT&T for long-distance service in 1971. In 1974, MCI filed an antitrust lawsuit against AT&T, alleging anti-competitive practices. The lawsuit initiated the process that ultimately led to the breakup of AT&T. It resulted in a settlement under which AT&T agreed to divest its local telephone operations, culminating in its breakup in 1984.\nGoeken left MCI in 1974 following a disagreement with William G. McGowan, whom he had brought on to help raise capital. Goeken favored focusing on business clients, while McGowan steered the company toward consumer services. McGowan later became chairman of MCI Communications, while Goeken retained an ownership stake after his departure.\n\nAirfone\nDespite widespread skepticism about the demand for in-flight communication, Goeken founded Airfone, a company providing air-to-ground telephone service. He later sold a stake in the company to GTE Corporation to secure funding but ultimately departed following disagreements over GTE’s management approach.\nAfter selling Airfone Corp. to GTE Corp., Goeken alleged that GTE breached their contract by not allowing him to run the company as he saw fit, and he asked a court to void his non-compete agreement. A court agreed, and Goeken then founded In-Flight Phone Corporation in Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois, with the intent of competing with GTE Airfone, which held a monopoly on air-to-ground telecommunications.  In 1990, the FCC approved Goeken's plan to share the Airfone frequencies, and solicited applications for and subsequently issued licences to several companies to operate digital Terrestrial Aeronautical Public Correspondence (TAPC) services. In-Flight Phone Corp. was awarded one of these licenses, and Goeken was clear to compete with GTE Airfone.\nIn-Flight Phone Corporation attracted more than $200 million from investors, and Goeken set out to build the first nationwide digital air-to-ground telecommunications network, capable of delivering static-free telephone calls, internet service and information services, to airplane seats. The company successfully competed for service contracts with USAir and other airlines.  In 1996, Goeken sold In-Flight Phone Corp. to MCI Corp.\n\nFTD Mercury\nGoeken developed FTD Mercury, a computer network used by florists to transmit flower orders electronically.\n\nGoeken Group\nIn 1995, he established Goeken Group, a holding company to manage his business ventures.\n\nPersonal life\nGoeken was married to Mona Lisa Goeken for 59 years. The couple met in high school and lived in the same home in Plainfield, Illinois, for over 40 years. They had a daughter, Sandra Goeken Miles, who was involved in his business ventures; a son, John; and seven grandchildren.\nGoeken was interested in aviation and was a licensed pilot. He was commonly known as \"Jack\".\n\nDeath\nGoeken died on September 16, 2010, at the Provena St. Joseph Medical Center in Joliet. He had been undergoing treatment for esophageal cancer for five years.\n\n\n== References ==",

The team departed for Rio on August 29.  The team included 9 athletes, 4 guides and 7 officials.    The team's Chef  de Mission was Nicklaus Nghumoono.  The team manager was Iitwayi Johannes.  The team administrator was Memory Kahlari. The flag bearer was sprinter and long-jumper Johanna Benson.  Benson won the country's first Paralympic gold and silver medal.\n\nFunding and support\nThe Ministry of Sport, Youth and National Service in Namibia was expected to fund several intensive training camps in preparation for Rio.  The Paralympic movement in the country is largely dependent on the government for financial and other support, as the private sector has not contributed much to Paralympic sportspeople's efforts. Additional private funding for the national team came from Coca-Cola, Seaflower and Miss Namibia 2015.\nAthlete Ananias Shikongo raised funds through a personal crowd funding campaign to finance his preparation.\nPromotional events to support Paralympic efforts were scheduled to take place around the country in the lead up to Rio.\n\nDisability classifications\nEvery participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.\n\nMedallists\nNamibia finished seventh  among all African countries on the gold medal table with 1 gold.

In historical texts, and also nowadays in its upstream, the Bogotá River is also called Funza River.\n\nCourse\nMain tributaries of the Bogotá River are the Teusacá, Torca, Juan Amarillo, Fucha, Tunjuelo, Soacha (left) and Neusa, Río Frío, Bojacá and Subachoque Rivers (right).\n\nThe headwaters of the Bogotá River are in the municipality of Villapinzón, in the northeastern part of Cundinamarca near the limits with Boyacá. It has a course of about 150 kilometres (93 mi) as it crosses the Bogotá savanna, passing through Zipaquirá and eleven small municipalities, before reaching the city of Bogotá. As it runs along the western border of the city, the river forms the outlet for the heavily polluted Salitre, Fucha and Tunjuelito Rivers. After passing through the municipality of Soacha, the Bogotá River plunges off the savanna at the Tequendama Falls.

As with many of his early books which were considered unsuitable for publication when they were first submitted as manuscripts, this was not science fiction, but rather a work of straight literary fiction. The manuscript was 481 pages in length. At the time it was published, it was one of only two Dick novels for which the manuscript was known to exist which remained unpublished. The other, Voices from the Street, was published in 2007.\nDwight Brown wrote the afterword. As of 2011, the original hardcover edition was out of print; in July 2012, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt released a trade paperback edition of Gather Yourselves Together, complete with Brown's afterword.\n\nPlot summary\nAmerican Metals Development Company (\"the Company\") maintains an industrial site in China near the Indian border. After Mao Zedong's Communists proclaim the People's Republic of China in 1949, the Company's Chinese assets are seized. The Company negotiates safe passage for its workers out of the country provided three people remain to hand the factory over to the Communists when they arrive. Three workers are chosen at random: the bitter 24-year-old Barbara Mahler; the cynical, older ex-radio host Verne Tildon; and the curious, naive 23-year-old Carl Fitter.\nFour years earlier, at a resort town near Boston named Castle, Barbara lost her virginity to Verne. In the present, Barbara holds a grudge against Verne, believing he took advantage of her at a young age. They have sex again out of boredom, after which Barbara is frightened by a ghost which she takes a sign to move on from Verne. Barbara begins seducing Carl, who is more interested in exploring the factory and reading his handwritten volume of personal philosophy to her. \nA representative from the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Harry Liu, arrives at the site ahead of time. While talking to him, Verne makes an analogy that the trio are the last of the old world, like Romans near the end of the empire, and the Chinese are like the first Christians at the beginning of the new world. They debate if the Communist regime's promises are empty or not, with Harry believing that some degree of myth and untruth is necessary for social organising. Verne gives Harry his pipe lighter as a present \"from the old world to the new\", which Harry destroys as he leaves.\nCarl experiences his sexual awakening watching Barbara bathe naked in a lake. Later that night, he finishes reading his manuscript to her. Barbara forces herself onto Carl, taking his virginity.\nThe rest of the CPPCC arrive the following morning. Carl asks a soldier how he knows his use of force is justified: the soldier takes out and reads a Communist tract about rising up against the bourgeoisie. Carl thanks the soldier, then gets in a truck with Barbara and Verne to leave.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "Kónya Szécsényi (or Konya; Hungarian: Szécsényi Kónya, Croatian: Konja Széchényi; died 1367), was a Hungarian baron, who served as Ban of Croatia and Dalmatia from 1366 until his death, during the reign of King Louis I of Hungary.\n\nLife\nHis birth name was Nicholas, but contemporaries (even in official documents) exclusively called him \"Kónya\" after his drooping ears (lit. \"lekonyuló\"). He was born into the powerful Szécsényi family as the eldest son of Thomas Szécsényi, Voivode of Transylvania and his first wife, an unidentified daughter of nobleman Paul Visontai from the gens Aba. His brothers were prelate Michael, Bishop of Vác then Eger, and Stephen, who was mentioned only once in 1331. After their mother's death, Thomas Szécsényi married to Anne, Duchess of Auschwitz. The marriage produced further three children, but all of them (Kónya's half-siblings: Caspar, Ladislaus I and Anne) died in their childhood.\nKónya first appeared in contemporary documents as a young courtier in 1327, when he already served as Master of the stewards for Queen Elizabeth, spouse of Charles I of Hungary. Despite his court function, he was not present on 17 April 1330, when Felician Záh, stormed into the dining room of the royal palace at Visegrád with a sword in his hand and attacked the royal family. However Kónya Szécsényi's familiar, deputy master John Cselenfi stabbed the assassin and the arriving royal guards killed Felician. Szécsényi functioned as Master of the stewards in the Queen's Court until 1340.\n\nHe became a staunch supporter of Louis I, who ascended the throne in 1342 after his father's death. The king's mother Elizabeth \"acted as a sort of co-regent\" for decades, because she exerted a powerful influence on him, which also resulted her courtier Szécsényi's growing influence. He actively participated in the Neapolitan campaigns of Louis the Great, residing in Italy for years. He was involved in the siege of Corato, leading a garrison composed of Hungarian and \"Lombard\" soldiers. He served as ispán of Sáros and Szepes Counties from 1346 to 1349, and of Nógrád County from 1346 to 1350 (also possessing Szanda Castle as its honor). He was mentioned as castellan of Csejte Castle (today Čachtice in Slovakia) in 1354. Between 1354 and 1360, he served as ispán of Gömör County and castellan of Fülek Castle (today in Fiľakovo, Slovakia). He was made ispán of Pozsony County, holding the dignity from 1360 to 1362. He finished his career as Ban of Croatia and Dalmatia, serving in this capacity from 1366 until his death in the next year.\nKónya Szécsényi married Elizabeth Haschendorfer, a daughter of Austrian noble Wulfing I Haschendorfer from Haschendorf/Hasfalva (today part of Neckenmarkt in Austria). Margaret, the sister of his wife was the wife of Lawrence Nagymartoni. After her brother Wulfing II was killed in the Siege of Zadar (1346) and left no male heirs, King Louis granted the status of a son to Elizabeth in 1347, authorizing her to inherit her father's landed property. As a result of this, Szécsényi acquired the castle of Ecseg and other estates through his wife, which after then belonged to the Hollókő lordship (and soon it was demolished by the Szécsényis themselves). The couple had three sons: Frank, Nicholas I and Simon. Frank and Simon became notable barons during the reign of Sigismund of Luxembourg, who continued to expand family wealth and held important dignities, while Nicholas, who owned the village of Cered, was last mentioned in 1383, possibly died around that year.\n\nReferences\n\n\n== Sources ==",

FGF18 and sprifermin act via the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR) family, with preferential activity via FGFR3c.\n\nOsteoarthritis\nIn 2020, Merck reported 5-year follow-up data from the Phase 2 clinical trial for knee osteoarthritis (OA). The placebo controlled, multi-center study demonstrated that sprifermin was able to promote statistically significant improvement in cartilage thickness relative to control in a dose-dependent manner, meeting the primary endpoint of the study. The findings suggested the ability of FGF18 to arrest progression to joint replacement, with 0% of patients in the high dose group progressing to Total Knee Replacement (TKR) surgery over the 5 year study period; in contrast, nearly 1 in 10 patients of the high risk subgroup progressed to TKR when treated with the placebo. These findings suggest significant potential of FGF18 as a disease modifying drug for the treatment of OA (DMOAD) and warrant further clinical evaluation.\nSprifermin was well tolerated with no severe adverse events associated with the treatment.  Long-term follow up showed that continual injections (up to 12 per year of bilateral treatment) may need to be sustained over a period of multiple years to prevent recurrence of cartilage loss.  Improvement in WOMAC, a secondary endpoint, was met for the Subgroup at Risk. Subsequent analysis further demonstrated that a clinically meaningful reduction in the rate of symptomatic progression (WOMAC) was demonstrated in the full trial population and Subgroup at Risk by the high treatment dose.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nSprifermin - AdisInsight",

    "text": "The Boca Beacon is an American newspaper based in Boca Grande. The paper was founded in 1980 by Marnie Banks, but currently the newspaper is owned by Hopkins & Daughter Publishing. The newspapers headquarters are at 431 Park Avenue Boca Grande, FL 33921.\n\nHistory\nThe newspaper was founded by Marnie Banks, with some help from Jack Harper, in 1980. It was first published from the old Kuhl house on Palm Avenue and printed in Clearwater. Afterwards, in May 1980 Banks's parents aided her to buy Jack Harper out. Banks then extended the newspaper's reach to the surrounding barrier islands, Placida and Cape Haze. At that time there were about 1,150 people subscribed to the newspaper.\nAs time went on Banks wanted the Boca Beacon to become a weekly paper. However, she knew that it would take too much work and had realized that there were other goals that she wanted to pursue and decided to find a new owner for the newspaper.\nOn July 27, 1988, the ownership of the newspaper transitioned to Dusty Hopkins and Terry Hopkins. Terry Hopkins had extensive experience in newspaper business and had just left Fort Myers News Press that same year. In addition, both Terry and Dusty Hopkins had worked for newspapers in August, Portland and Waterville, Maine as well as in New York at The Ithaca Journal, in Washington D.C. and Connecticut. They both moved to the Gasparilla Island shortly before they purchased the paper. Afterwards, they purchased the Gulfcoast Press and printed the newspaper in the Naples. Currently, the Boca Beacon is printed at the Venice Gondolier newspaper.\n\nCoverage\nThe newspaper is in circulation to the surrounding barrier islands, Placida and Cape Haze. The online website's news section of the Boca Beacon is divided into 7 sections: Spotlight, Featured News, Breaking News, Editorial, Obituaries, Letter to Editor and  Commentary.\n\nFishing Center\nOn the online website of the Boca Beacon there is a section that's dedicated to the Tide Table for Boca Grande, FL Station ID 8725520 as well as it provides fishing reports.\n\nBoca Grande's Community Calendar\nThis section of their website provides information on the various events in Boca Grande.\n\nSignificant Stories\nOne of the more significant stories of the newspaper is about the Gasparilla Island Lighthouse campaign. The Boca Beacon extensively covered the need to restore both the Gasparilla Island Light and Port of Boca Lighthouse. Currently the Port of Boca Lighthouse has received state funding under the historic restoration category through an amendment (995154) that was proposed by Florida Senator Lizbeth Benacquisto (R-Fort Myers).\n\nAwards\n2016 Florida Press Association Better Weekly Newspaper contest\nFirst place award issued to Leighton Ingram for his fishing column titled “An Old Skiff and a New Tide”\nFirst place award issued to Editor Marcy Shortuse for her Arts, Entertainment and Review Reporting on Taste of Boca.\nSecond place award issued to Editor Marcy Shortuse for her sports column titled, “There are a Lot of Legends in Boca Grande Pass”\nSecond place award issued to Editor Marcy Shortuse and Art Director Daniel Godwin for Tarpon Times.\nThird place award issued to Writer Susan Erwin for Best Headline called “100 Trillion Friends You Didn’t Know You Had,”\nThird place award issued to Writer Susan Erwin in the Outdoor & Recreation field for her story on Silver Creek Preserve.\nThird place award issued to Writer Susan Erwin in the Arts, Entertainment and Review Reporting category for her story on Ingrid Bergman's daughter.\nThird place award issued to Editor Marcy Shortuse in the General News Story category for her story titled, “Saying Good-Bye to the Old Boca Grande Swing.”\nThird place award issued to Beacon cartoonist Dave Horton for “Hortoons.”\nThird place award issued to Editor Marcy Shortuse in the Editorial Award category for her piece titled, “The Parking-Challenged Ghosts of Boca Grande.”\n2017 Florida Press Association Better Weekly Newspaper contest\nFirst place award issued to Art Director Daniel Godwin and Editor Marcy Shortuse in the “Special Issue, Section or Supplement” category for the 2017 Tarpon Times.\nSecond place award issued to Editor Marcy Shortuse in the “General Excellence” category and in the “Best Obituary” category.\nSecond place award issued to Publisher Dusty Hopkins in the “Spot News Photo” category.\nThird place award issued to Freelance Photographer Skip Perry in the “Spot News Photo” category.\nThird place award issued to Contributor Erica Ress-Martin in the “Arts, Entertainment and Review Reporting” category.\nThird place award issued to Writer Sue Erwin in the “Community History” category.\n2018 Florida Press Association Better Weekly Newspaper Contest\nArt Director Daniel Godwin and Editor Marcy Shortuse took a first place in the “Special Issue, Section or Supplement” category for the 2017 Tarpon Times, and Shortuse took a second place in the “General Excellence” category and a second place in the “Best Obituary” category.

    "text": "Aristaces or Aristakes I (Armenian: Արիստակէս Ա, romanized: Aristakēs) was the second Catholicos of the Armenian Church from 325 until his death in 333. He was the younger son and successor of Gregory the Illuminator, the founder and first head of the Armenian Church and his wife, Julitta (or Mariam) of Armenia.\nMost of the information about Aristaces's life comes from the fifth-century Armenian history attributed to Agathangelos. Aristaces was born in Caesarea of Cappadocia to Gregory the Illuminator and his wife Julitta (or Mariam) of Armenia. He is said to have entered a monastery with his mother as a child after his father left for Armenia. When Aristaces grew up, he went under the tutelage of a monk called Nicomachus, who sent him to live as an ascetic in the desert. Around 325, when Gregory wished to give up the Catholicosate in favor of a life as a hermit, King Tiridates III of Armenia sent for Aristaces and his brother Vrtanes and had them brought to Armenia to take over leadership of the Church.\nIn 325, Aristaces was sent as the Armenian representative to the First Council of Nicaea and brought back the Nicene canons; his signature appears among those of the bishops who participated in the council. Aristaces is also said to have participated in an embassy together with Gregory and King Tiridates to the newly converted Roman emperor Constantine the Great, although this is considered \"purely legendary\" by scholar Robert W. Thomson.\nAgathangelos writes nothing about Aristaces's death. Faustus of Byzantium writes that Aristaces died \"a confessor's death\" but gives no further details, while Movses Khorenatsi claims that he was murdered in Sophene by a governor named Archilaeus in retaliation for being reprimanded by the Catholicos. According to Khorenatsi and Faustus, Aristaces was buried in the town of Til in the district of Acilisene, although in a different chapter Faustus gives the alternative burial site of Tordan in the district of Daranali, where Gregory is said to have been buried.\n\nSee also\nGregorids\n\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\nGarsoïan, Nina G.

He was born in Lisbon.\n\nCareer\nRadio\nAt age 10, Markl already simulated radio broadcasts at home, while in the late 80s, he started working at a pirate radio station, A Voz de Benfica. With the desire of entering the professional radio world, he enrolled at CENJOR's journalism course, in 1990. Upon finishing, he worked as a journalist on Correio da Manhã Rádio (1991–1993), later on Rádio Comercial (1993–1997), even though this wasn't his vocation. On CMR, Markl fmade a program called Prok Der e Vier, where he started the satirical radionovela \"A Saga de Abílio Mortaça\". Upon its closure, he was transferred to Rádio Comercial, where its production continued. Thanks to this work, he was invited to enter the Produções Fictícias creative agency in 1995.\nMarkl is well known in Portugal for his radio series \"O Homem Que Mordeu o Cão\" (The Man Who Bit The dog). It started in 1997, when he joined Pedro Ribeiro, José Carlos Malato and Ana Lamy for the morning show at Rádio Comercial. In 2001, Malato and Lamy left, and were replaced by Maria de Vasconcelos. The radio series later spawned a TV show, and three books. \nSince October 2008, Markl has worked for Antena 3, with his current shows being \"São Coisas Que Acontecem\", \"Laboratolarilolela\" (a showcase of lesser known Pimba artists and songs), and \"Nuno & Nando\" (with Fernando Alvim). Before \"São Coisas Que Acontecem\", he ran \"Há Vida em Markl\" (based on a comic strip formerly published on Inimigo Público) and \"O Livro dos Porquês\" (where funny answers were given to mundane factoid questions). Another one of his most famous radio shows is Caderneta de Cromos, which ran on Rádio Comercial, upon his return in 2009. In it, he reminisced about nostalgic things from his childhood.\nHe has another show on Rádio Comercial,  Grandiosa História Universal das Traquitanas, which discusses mankind's inventions.\n\nTelevision\nUpon joining Produções Fictícias, he wrote sketches for Herman Zap (1995-96), Herman Enciclopédia (1997), Herman 98 (1998), Herman 99 (1999), Herman SIC (2000), Paraíso Filmes (2001–2002), O Programa da Maria (2002), Hora H (2007) and Os Contemporâneos (2008), this last one, also as an actor.\nNuno Markl debuted his hosting career on television in 2001, co-hosting \"Sem Filtro\" (a youth-oriented talk show on RTP1) alongside Rita Mendes and Gaspar Borges. He then moved to SIC Radical, where he worked on two different projects revolving around his other passion, film. Also on SIC Radical, he had a television show with Fernando Alvim, O Perfeito Anormal, which launched the comedy troupe Gato Fedorento. \nHe wrote many cult sketches for Herman José, especially for his show \"Herman Enciclopédia\". He wrote for the prematurely cancelled Programa da Maria (which had some Upright Citizens Brigade influenced sketches) and now writes for Os Contemporâneos. Nuno regularly updates his weblog, A Cave do Markl, providing movie reviews, video blogs, and updates on his work. Other side projects include TV and print ads for Café Delta and performing voice acting duties for the Portuguese version of films:\n\n\"Spike\" in Flushed Away;\n\"Raphael\" in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles;\n\"Barry B. Benson\" in Bee Movie\nHe was also responsible for translating and adapting Monty Python sketches for an onstage Portuguese version, performed by, among others, Bruno Nogueira, Miguel Guilherme, António Feio and José Pedro Gomes.\n\nPersonal life\nNuno Markl lives in the Greater Lisbon area. He is of Austrian descent through his paternal grandfather. On 3 September 2010, he married the radio and television show host Ana Galvão, with whom he has a son, Pedro, born 7 June 2009.  In 2016, they announced their separation.\nNuno and Ana are well known advocates for children's and animal rights.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nA Cave do Markl – Markl's weblog",

On 1 July the same year he became an assistant at the Astrophysical Institute Potsdam.\nEarly in his career as an astronomer he aided German solar astronomer Gustav Spörer in his work to observe sun spot activity. Kempf joined an 1882 German expedition to Chile to observe the transit of Venus across the Sun. He was then part of solar eclipse missions to Russia in 1887 and 1914. In 1886, he was promoted to full astronomer and began a collaboration with his friend, German astronomer Gustav Müller to perform a massive survey of northern stars with magnitudes brighter than 7.5 found in the Bonner Durchmusterung. This work was published between 1894 and 1906, with the completed so-called Potsdamer Photometrische Durchmusterung appearing in 1907.

    "title": "Glutathione reductase",
    "text": "Glutathione reductase (GR) also known as glutathione-disulfide reductase (GSR) is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the GSR gene. Glutathione reductase (EC 1.8.1.7) catalyzes the reduction of glutathione disulfide (GSSG) to the sulfhydryl form glutathione (GSH), which is a critical molecule in resisting oxidative stress and maintaining the reducing environment of the cell.  Glutathione reductase functions as dimeric disulfide oxidoreductase and utilizes an FAD prosthetic group and NADPH to reduce one molar equivalent of GSSG to two molar equivalents of GSH:\n\nThe glutathione reductase is conserved between all kingdoms. In bacteria, yeasts, and animals, one glutathione reductase gene is found; however, in plant genomes, two GR genes are encoded. Drosophila and trypanosomes do not have any GR at all. In these organisms, glutathione reduction is performed by either the thioredoxin or the trypanothione system, respectively.\n\nFunction\nGlutathione plays a key role in maintaining proper function and preventing oxidative stress in human cells. It can scavenge hydroxyl radicals, singlet oxygen, and various electrophiles. Reduced glutathione reduces the oxidized form of the enzyme glutathione peroxidase, which in turn reduces hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a dangerously reactive species within the cell. In addition, it plays a key role in the metabolism and clearance of xenobiotics, acts as a cofactor in certain detoxifying enzymes, participates in transport, and regenerates antioxidants such and Vitamins E and C to their reactive forms. The ratio of GSSG/GSH present in the cell is a key factor in properly maintaining the oxidative balance of the cell, that is, it is critical that the cell maintains high levels of the reduced glutathione and a low level of the oxidized glutathione disulfide. This narrow balance is maintained by glutathione reductase, which catalyzes the reduction of GSSG to GSH.\n\nStructure\nGlutathione reductase from human erythrocytes is a homodimer consisting of 52kDa monomers, each containing 3 domains. GR exhibits single sheet, double layered topology where an anti-parallel beta-sheet is largely exposed to the solvent on one face while being covered by random coils on the other face.  This includes and NADPH-binding Domain, FAD-binding domain(s) and a dimerization domain. Each monomer contains 478 residues and one FAD molecule. GR is a thermostable protein, retaining function up to 65 °C.\n\nReaction mechanism\nSteps:\n\nReductive half\nThe action of GR proceeds through two distinct half reactions, a reductive half mechanism followed by an oxidative half. In the first half, NADPH reduces FAD present in GSR to produce a transient FADH− anion. This anion then quickly breaks a disulfide bond of Cys58 - Cys63, forming a short lived covalent bond a stable charge-transfer complex between the flavin and Cys63. The now oxidized NADP+ is released and is subsequently replaced by a new molecule of NADPH. This is the end of the so-called reductive half of the mechanism.\n\nOxidative half\nIn the oxidative half of the mechanism, Cys63 nucleophilically attacks the nearest sulfide unit in the GSSG molecule (promoted by His467), which creates a mixed disulfide bond (GS-Cys58) and a GS− anion. His467 of GSR then protonates the GS- anion to release the first molecule of GSH. Next, Cys63 nucleophilically attacks the sulfide of Cys58, releasing  a GS− anion, which, in turn, picks up a solvent proton and is released from the enzyme, thereby creating the second GSH. So, for every GSSG and NADPH, two reduced GSH molecules are gained, which can again act as antioxidants scavenging reactive oxygen species in the cell.\n\nInhibition\nIn vitro, glutathione reductase is inhibited by low concentrations of sodium arsenite and methylated arsenate metabolites, but in vivo, significant Glutathione Reductase inhibition by sodium arsenate has only been at 10 mg/kg/day. Glutathione reductase is also inhibited by some flavanoids, a class of pigments produced by plants.\n\nClinical significance\nGSH is a key cellular antioxidant and plays a major role in the phase 2 metabolic clearance of electrophilic xenobiotics. The importance of the GSH pathway and enzymes that affect this delicate balance is gaining an increased level of attention in recent years. Although glutathione reductase has been an attractive target for many pharmaceuticals, there have been no successful glutathione reductase related therapeutic compounds created to date. In particular, glutathione reductase appears to be a good target for anti-malarials, as the glutathione reductase of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum has a significantly different protein fold than that of mammalian glutathione reductase. By designing drugs specific to p. falciparum it may be possible to selectively induce oxidative stress in the parasite, while not affecting the host.\nThere are two main classes of GR targeting compounds:\n\nInhibitors of GSSG binding, or dimerization: Reactive electrophiles such as gold compounds, and fluoronaphthoquinones.\nDrugs which use glutathione reductase to regenerate, such as redox cyclers. Two examples of these types of compounds are Methylene blue and Naphthoquinone.\nClinical trials performed in Burkina Faso have revealed mixed results when treating malaria with Naphthoquinones\nIn cells exposed to high levels of oxidative stress, like red blood cells, up to 10% of the glucose consumption may be directed to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) for production of the NADPH needed for this reaction. In the case of erythrocytes, if the PPP is non-functional, then the oxidative stress in the cell will lead to cell lysis and anemia.\nLupus is an autoimmune disorder in which patients produce an elevated quantity of antibodies that attack DNA and other cell components. In a recent study, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the Glutathione Reductase gene was found to be highly associated with lupus in African Americans in the study. African Americans with lupus have also been shown to express less reduced glutathione in their T cells. The study's authors believe that reduced glutathione reductase activity may contribute to the increased production of reactive oxygen in African Americans with lupus.\nIn mice, glutathione reductase has been implicated in the oxidative burst, a component of the immune response. The oxidative burst is a defense mechanism in which neutrophils produce and release reactive oxidative species in the vicinity of bacteria or fungi to destroy the foreign cells. Glutathione Reductase deficient neutrophils were shown to produce a more transient oxidative burst in response to bacteria than neutrophils that express GR at ordinary levels. The mechanism of Glutathione Reductase in sustaining the oxidative burst is still unknown.\n\nDeficiency\nGlutathione reductase deficiency is a rare disorder in which the glutathione reductase activity is absent from erythrocytes, leukocytes or both. In one study this disorder was observed in only two cases in 15,000 tests for glutathione reductase deficiency performed over the course of 30 years. In the same study, glutathione reductase deficiency was associated with cataracts and favism in one patient and their family, and with severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in another patient. It has been proposed that the glutathione redox system (of which glutathione reductase is a part) is almost exclusively responsible for the protecting of eye lens cells from hydrogen peroxide because these cells are deficient in catalase, an enzyme which catalyzes the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide, and the high rate of cataract incidence in  glutathione reductase deficient individuals.\nSome patients exhibit deficient levels of glutathione activity as a result of not consuming enough riboflavin in their diets. Riboflavin is a precursor for FAD, whose reduced form donates two electron to the disulfide bond which is present in the oxidized form of glutathione reductase in order to begin the enzyme's catalytic cycle. In 1999, a study found that 17.8% of males and 22.4% of females examined in Saudi Arabia suffered from low glutathione reductase activity due to riboflavin deficiency.\n\nConnection to favism\nIn favism, patients lack glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, an enzyme in their pentose phosphate pathway that reduces NADP+ to NADPH while catalyzing the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphoglucono-δ-lactone. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient individuals have less NADPH available for the reduction of oxidized glutathione via glutathione reductase. Thus their basal ratio of oxidized to reduced glutathione is significantly higher than that of patients who express glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, normally, making them unable to effectively respond to high levels of reactive oxygen species, which causes cell lysis.\n\nMonitoring glutathione reductase activity\nThe activity of glutathione reductase is used as indicator for oxidative stress. The activity can be monitored by the NADPH consumption, with absorbance at 340 nm, or the formed GSH can be visualized by Ellman's reagent. Alternatively the activity can be measured using roGFP (redox-sensitive Green Fluorescent Protein).\n\nIn plants\nAs it does in human cells, glutathione reductase helps to protect plant cells from reactive oxygen species. In plants, reduced glutathione participates in the glutathione-ascorbate cycle in which reduced glutathione reduces dehydroascorbate, a reactive byproduct of the reduction of hydrogen peroxide. In particular, glutathione reductase contributes to plants' response to abiotic stress. The enzyme's activity has been shown to be modulated in response to metals, metalloids, salinity, drought, UV radiation and heat induced stress.\n\nHistory\nGlutathione reductase was first purified in 1955 at Yale University by P. Janmeda. Janmeda also identified NADPH as the primary electron donor for the enzyme. Later groups confirmed the presence of FAD and the thiol group, and an initial mechanism was suggested for the mechanism in 1965. The initial (low resolution) structure of glutathione reductase was solved in 1977. This was quickly followed by a 3Å structure by Shulze et al. in 1978. Glutathione reductase has been studied exhaustively since these early experiments, and is subsequently one of the most well characterized enzymes to date.\n\nInteractive pathway map\nInteractive pathway can be found here:\npathway map\n\nReferences\n\n\n== Further reading ==",

    "text": "Edison Vasilievich Denisov (Russian: Эдисо́н Васи́льевич Дени́сов, 6 April 1929 – 24 November 1996) was a Russian composer in the so-called \"Underground\",  \"alternative\" or \"nonconformist\"  division of Soviet music.\n\nBiography\nDenisov was born in Tomsk, Siberia. He studied mathematics before deciding to spend his life composing. This decision was enthusiastically supported by Dmitri Shostakovich, who gave him lessons in composition.\nIn 1951–56 Denisov studied at the Moscow Conservatory: composition with Vissarion Shebalin, orchestration with Nikolai Rakov, analysis with Viktor Tsukkerman and piano with Vladimir Belov. In 1956–59 he composed the opera Ivan-Soldat (Soldier Ivan) in three acts based on Russian folk fairy tales.\nHe began his own study of scores that were difficult to obtain in the USSR at that time, including music by composers ranging from Mahler and Debussy to Boulez and Stockhausen. He wrote a series of articles giving a detailed analysis of different aspects of contemporary compositional techniques and at same time actively experimented as a composer, trying to find his own way.\nAfter graduating from the Moscow Conservatory, he taught orchestration and later composition there. His pupils included the composers Dmitri Smirnov, Elena Firsova, Dilorom Saidaminova, Vladimir Tarnopolsky, Sergey Pavlenko, Ivan Sokolov, Yuri Kasparov. He supported and encouraged Dmitri Capyrin and Alexander Shchetynsky who have never been his pupils. See: List of music students by teacher: C to F#Edison Denisov.\nIn 1979, at the Sixth Congress of the Union of Soviet Composers, he was blacklisted as one of \"Khrennikov's Seven\" for unapproved participation in a number of festivals of Soviet music in the West.\nDenisov became a leader of the Association for Contemporary Music reestablished in Moscow in 1990. Later he moved to France, where after an accident and long illness he died in a Saint-Mandé hospital in 1996.\n\nMusic\nDenisov's cycle for soprano and chamber ensemble Le soleil des Incas (1964), setting poems by Gabriela Mistral and dedicated to Pierre Boulez, brought him international recognition following a series of successful performances of the work in Darmstadt and Paris (1965). Igor Stravinsky liked the piece, discovering the \"remarkable talent\" of its composer. However, it was harshly criticised by the Union of Soviet Composers for its \"western influences\", \"erudition instead of creativity\", and \"total composer's arbitrary\" (Tikhon Khrennikov). After that, performances of his works were frequently banned in the Soviet Union.\nLater he wrote a flute concerto for Aurèle Nicolet, a violin concerto for Gidon Kremer, works for the oboist Heinz Holliger, clarinettist Eduard Brunner and a sonata for alto saxophone and piano for Jean-Marie Londeix, that became highly popular among saxophone players.\nHis sombre but striking Requiem, setting a multi-lingual text (English, French, German, and Latin) based on works by the Francisco Tanzer, was given its first performance in Hamburg in 1980.\nAmong his major works are the operas L'écume des jours after Boris Vian (1981), Quatre Filles after Pablo Picasso (1986) and ballet Confession after Alfred de Musset.\n\nHonours and awards\nPeople's Artist of the Russian Federation\nHonoured Artist of the RSFSR\nChevalier of the Legion of Honour\nCommander of the Order of Arts and Letters\n\nSelected works\nChamber\n\n1958 Sonata for Two Violins\n1958 Three concert pieces for violin and piano\n1960 Sonata for Flute and Piano\n1961 String quartet no. 2\n1963 Concerto for flute, oboe, piano and percussion\n1963 Violin sonata\n1968 Ode (in Memory of Che Guevara) for clarinet, piano and percussion\n1968 Musique Romantique (Романтическая музыка—Romantic Music) for oboe, harp and string trio\n1969 String trio\n1969 Wind quintet for flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon and horn\n1969 Silhouettes for flute, two pianos and percussion\n1969 Chant des Oiseaux (Пение птиц) for prepared piano (or harpsichord) and tape\n1969 DSCH for clarinet, trombone, cello and piano\n1969 The Singing of the Birds for the ANS photoelectronic synthesizer\n1970 Sonata for alto saxophone and piano\n1971 Piano Trio\n1972 Sonatina for violin\n1972 Sonata for clarinet solo\n1974 Signes en blanc (Знаки на белом—The Signs on White) for piano\n1975 Choral Varié for trombone and piano\n1983 Five Etudes for Solo Bassoon\n1984 Variations on Bach chorale \"Es ist genung\" for viola and piano (or chamber orchestra)\n1985 Three Pictures after Paul Klee for viola, oboe, horn, piano, vibraphone and double bass\n1987 Clarinet Quintet\n1987 Piano quintet\n1991 Four pieces for string quartet\n1991 Octet for winds\n1991 Quintet for saxophone quartet and piano\n1993 Sonata for clarinet and piano\n1994 Sonata for alto saxophone and cello\n1995 Trio for flute, bassoon and piano\n1995 Des ténèbres à la lumière (From Dusk to Light) for accordion\n1996 Sonata for two flutes (May)\n1996 Femme et oiseaux (The Woman and the Birds) homage to Joan Miró for piano, string quartet and woodwind quartet\n1996 Avant le coucher du soleil for alto flute and vibraphone\nConcertos \n\n1972 Cello Concerto\n1975 Piano Concerto\n1975 Flute Concerto\n1977 Violin Concerto\n1977 Concerto Piccolo for saxophone and six percussionists\n1978 Concerto for flute, oboe, and orchestra\n1982 Variations for cello and orchestra on Haydn's Canon Tod ist ein langer Schlaf\n1982 Chamber music for viola, harpsichord, and strings\n1982  Concerto for bassoon, cello and orchestra\n1984 Concerto for 2 violas, harpsichord, and strings\n1985 Happy ending for 2 violins, cello, double bass and string orchestra\n1986 Viola Concerto\n1986 Oboe Concerto\n1989 Clarinet Concerto\n1991 Guitar Concerto\n1993 Concerto for flute, vibraphone, harpsichord and string orchestra\n1996 Concerto for flute, clarinet and orchestra\nSymphonic \n\n1958 Little suite\n1970 Peinture (Живопись—Painting) for orchestra\n1982 Chamber Symphony No. 1\n1983 Epitaph for chamber orchestra\n1985 Suite from the Ballet Confession\n1986 Waltz by Franz Schubert\n1987 Symphony No. 1\n1994 Chamber Symphony No. 2\n1996 Symphony No. 2\nChoral/Vocal\n\n1964 Le soleil des Incas (Солнце инков—The Sun of Incas), text by Gabriela Mistral for soprano, flute, oboe, horn, trumpet, two pianos, percussion, violin and cello\n1964 Italian Songs, text by Alexander Blok for soprano, flute, horn, violin and harpsichord\n1966 Les pleurs (Плачи—Lamentations), text of Russian folksongs for soprano, piano and three percussionists\n1966  Five stories of Mr. Keuner  (B.

    "title": "The Temper Trap",
    "text": "The Temper Trap are an Australian indie rock band formed in 2005 by Dougy Mandagi, Jonathon Aherne, and Toby Dundas. In 2008, the group relocated from Melbourne to London. The band released their debut album Conditions in June 2009 to favourable reviews and commercial success; it peaked at No. 9 on the ARIA Albums Chart and into the top 30 on the UK Albums Chart. Its lead single, \"Sweet Disposition\", peaked in the top 10 on the Belgian, Irish and UK Singles Charts and reached No. 14 on the ARIA Singles Chart. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2010 in November, The Temper Trap won Best Group and Most Popular Australian Single for \"Sweet Disposition\". Their eponymous second album was released in late May/early June 2012 under Liberation Music (AUS), Infectious Records (UK) and Glassnote Records (US). The album won the band Best Rock Album, and they also won Best Group at the 2012 ARIA Awards. In October 2013 guitarist Lorenzo Sillitto left the band, during the recording of the third album.\n\nHistory\nFormation and The Temper Trap EP (2005–2007)\nThe Temper Trap formed as an indie pop band in 2005. Indonesian-born Mandagi, who is originally from Manado and a grand-nephew of Arie Frederik Lasut, was a busker in Melbourne, Australia, in 1999 when he met Aherne, who wanted to learn to play guitar. Six years later, Mandagi met Dundas while the pair worked in a clothing store. In 2005, the three friends decided to form a band, with Mandagi on vocals and guitars, and Dundas on drums, while Aherne was later convinced to join on bass guitar by Mandagi. The group was named \"The Temper Trap\" after Temper Temper, the trio's first choice, was rejected due to its use by a United States (US) band. The Temper Trap rehearsed with a variety of second guitarists before Dundas recommended his former Geelong Grammar schoolmate, Sillitto, on lead guitar. The group performed at St Jerome's Laneway Festival in March 2006.\nThe group signed to Michael Gudinski's label, Liberation Music, and released its debut extended play (EP), The Temper Trap, in November 2006 through the label; the EP was produced by Scott Horscroft (The Sleepy Jackson, Silverchair). According to a live review by \"planetclare\" of Australian music website FasterLouder, Dundas sometimes abandons the drums and plays guitar, while Mandagi's voice \"hits a note and then transcends it, slicing the sound barrier and leaving you with your mouth open and your eyes wide\". The review also described Aherne regularly moving around the stage and Sillitto providing guitar solos that \"subtlety drove the melody from the side of stage\". After finishing an Australian tour, the band then performed at the V Festival in Melbourne, Sydney (March 2007) and the Gold Coast (April).\n\nConditions (2008–2011)\nIn late 2008, The Temper Trap started recording their debut album, Conditions, in Melbourne with engineering by record producer Kalju Tonuma. They travelled to the UK and attracted the attention of the local music industry after playing at the Musexpo in London in October. By January 2009, the band had signed to Infectious Records for European releases. The BBC chose The Temper Trap in its top 15 Sound of 2009 list. In March, the band finished recording Conditions in London with UK music producer Jim Abbiss. Mandagi said his key influences when recording it had included Radiohead, Prince, Massive Attack and U2. In May, after performing at South by Southwest in March, they signed to Glassnote Records for US releases. The album was released in Australia on 19 June and debuted at No. 9 on the Australian ARIA Albums Chart. It was released in the UK in August. The band had returned to London in early May to \"spend a bit of time on the continent and try and build a fan base over here\", according to Sillitto. He says \"it was always our dream to at least come over here and give it a good crack early on\".\nThe album's lead single, \"Sweet Disposition\", was released in Australia in October 2008. It was re-recorded with Abbiss and re-issued in June 2009. This version peaked in the top 10 on the Belgian, Irish and UK Singles Charts and reached No. 14 on the ARIA Singles Chart. The group played shows in Europe with Silversun Pickups and garnered attention from newfound fans and media. In August, they played the Reading and Leeds Festivals. In September, the band embarked on their first headlining UK tour, including Hare and Hounds in Birmingham and the 300-capacity Arts Centre in Norwich. The tour started and finished in Brighton, with the Goldhawks as their support act.\nIn August, The Temper Trap played on a balcony over London's Camden Lock to promote the release of their next single \"Science of Fear\" on the online viral music show BalconyTV. In late November, the group cancelled sold-out show dates in Germany to return to Australia to perform at the ARIA Awards. They received four nominations in the categories Album of the Year, Breakthrough Album of the Year and Best Rock Album for Conditions, and Single of the Year for \"Sweet Disposition\".\nDuring 2010, the group toured the UK as well as appearing at several music festivals such as Oxegen, Glastonbury, Rock Werchter, Roskilde Festival, V Festival as well as Big Day Out and Splendour in the Grass in Australia. In the US, the band embarked on their first headlining tour, with the single \"Sweet Disposition\" receiving significant airplay and appearances in commercials and television shows. At the APRA Awards of 2010, Mandagi and Sillitto received the Song of the Year award for writing \"Sweet Disposition\". They followed with a comeback tour of Australia in July, playing to crowds of over 5000 people, their second largest to date with the largest being Mexico City's Corona Fest in October. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2010 in November, The Temper Trap won two awards: Best Group and Most Popular Australian Single for \"Sweet Disposition\". In February 2011, the group was nominated for a BRIT Award in the Best International Breakthrough Artist category.\n\nThe Temper Trap (2012–2015)\nIn March 2012 the band performed a short run of sold-out shows in North America. They also completed extensive tours in 2012 in the UK, North America and Australia, as well as numerous festival appearances. On 13 April 2012, they released the official video for the single, \"Need Your Love\", directed by Dugan O'Neal (O'Neal released the video on his personal Vimeo channel in the previous week). It features a Karate Kid-like mini-film, with short appearances by the band members as the general public. Shortly after its release, a behind-the-scenes video followed.\nThe Temper Trap released their self-titled second album on 18 May (Australia/NZ/Germany), 21 May (UK/Europe) and 5 June (US/Canada/Mexico) 2012. On 7 March, they released a new song titled \"Rabbit Hole\". The first single, \"Need Your Love\". was released on 23 March 2012. On 1 June, the video for \"Trembling Hands\" was released online. The Tom Haines-directed video tells the tale of a young trapeze artist discovering herself through the emotions and risks involved with her discipline. Dougy Mandagi is the only member of the band to appear in the video, which shot on location in Cuba. \"Trembling Hands\" was officially released as a single in May 2012, which was followed by a remix EP in July. The remix EP features mixes by Benny Benassi, Chet Faker and Beni.\nOn 6 August 2012, the Temper Trap played a live streaming concert for YouTube Presents before a select group of fans in New York City, USA. The concert consisted of six songs: three from the album Conditions and three from the self-titled album. They played as one of the opening acts for Coldplay during the Australia/New Zealand leg of their Mylo Xyloto Tour in November and December 2012. On 6 July 2013, they supported The Rolling Stones at Hyde Park in Sydney, Australia, alongside American musician Gary Clark Jr.\nIn November 2012, The Temper Trap won the Best Rock Album award for their eponymous second album and the Best Group award at the 2012 ARIA Awards. In January 2013, \"Trembling Hands\" was voted into the number 22 position as part of Triple J's Hottest 100 countdown. A June 2013 media article revealed that the band were continuing to work on their third studio album. In October 2013, an official statement confirmed that lead guitarist Lorenzo Sillitto parted ways with the band. Since then the band have continued to play live while working on their third album with Damian Taylor.\nIn September 2012, The Temper Trap played in front of approximately 100,000 AFL fans at half time of the AFL Grand Final between Sydney and Hawthorn.\n\nThick as Thieves (2016–present)\nThe title track from the band's third studio album, Thick as Thieves. was released as its lead single in February and peaked at number 92 in Australia. On 11 April 2016, the band released the second single, \"Fall Together\", the same day the album was officially announced on their Facebook page. The album was released on 10 June 2016, marking their first release in four years.\nIn May 2018, The Temper Trap supported American rock band Imagine Dragons on the Australian and New Zealand legs of their Evolve World Tour. This included performances in Perth, Melbourne, Brisbane, Sydney, Auckland, and Wellington.\n\nMembers\nCurrent members\nDougy Mandagi – lead vocals, rhythm guitar, percussion (2005–present); keyboards (2005–2008)\nToby Dundas – drums, occasional rhythm guitar, backing vocals (2005–present)\nJonathon Aherne – bass, percussion, backing vocals (2005–present)\nJoseph Greer – keyboards, backing vocals (2008–present), lead guitar (2013–present), rhythm guitar (2008–2013)\nFormer members\nLorenzo Sillitto – lead guitar, backing vocals (2005–2013)\nTimeline\n\nDiscography\nStudio albums\nRemix albums\nExtended plays\nSingles\nNotes\nAwards\nSee also\nMusic of Australia\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nThe Temper Trap discography at MusicBrainz",

    "title": "Xia (Sixteen Kingdoms)",
    "text": "Xia (Chinese: 夏; pinyin: Xià), known in historiography as Hu Xia (胡夏), Xiongnu Xia (匈奴夏), Helian Xia (赫連夏) or the Great Xia (大夏), was a dynastic state of China ruled by the Helian clan of Tiefu-Xiongnu ethnicity during the Sixteen Kingdoms period. Prior to establishing the Xia, the imperial clan existed as a tribal entity known as the Tiefu (simplified Chinese: 铁弗; traditional Chinese: 鐵弗; pinyin: Tiěfú).\nAll rulers of the Xia declared themselves \"emperors\". Both the Tiefu and Xia were based in the Ordos Desert, and during the reign of Helian Bobo, they constructed their capital of Tongwan, a heavily fortified and state-of-the-art city that served as a frontier garrison until the Song dynasty. Its ruins were discovered during the Qing dynasty and can still be seen in present-day Northern Shaanxi. At its peak, the Xia also controlled the Guanzhong region in modern-day central Shaanxi. Due to being a mix of the Xiongnu and Xianbei ethnicities, the Tiefu were initially known as a group of Wuhuan, which in the 4th century, was another term for \"miscellaneous hu\" or \"zahu\" (雜胡). It was not until Helian Bobo came to power that they fully affirm their Xiongnu lineage in a bid for legitimacy by claiming descent from the ancient Xia dynasty.\n\nHistory\nTiefu tribe\nThe rulers of Xia came from the Tiefu tribe, who descended from the Southern Xiongnu leader, Qubei. Qubei was a member of the ruling-Luandi clan as the uncle of the last Chanyu, Huchuquan, although a later and more dubious account alleged that he was the descendant of a Han dynasty prince-turned-Xiongnu noble, Liu Jinbo instead. In 196, he assisted the warlord, Cao Cao in escorting Emperor Xian of Han to Xuchang, and in 216, Cao Cao appointed him to supervise the Five Divisions of the Southern Xiongnu in Shanxi. As the Xiongnu imperial family claimed descent from the Han dynasty through their heqin marriages with Han princesses, Qubei's family adopted the \"Liu\" (劉) surname.\nIn 309, Qubei's grandson, Liu Hu succeeded his father, Liu Gaoshengyuan, as chieftain and named his tribe \"Tiefu\". The word \"Tiefu\" referred to people with Xiongnu fathers and Xianbei mothers, indicating that the tribe had intermingled with the Xianbei. The Tiefu were also known as Wuhuan, which in the 4th century was another term for \"miscellaneous hu\" or \"zahu\". \nIn 310, Liu Hu rebelled against the Western Jin dynasty in Shanxi. The Tuoba-Xianbei tribe allied with the Jin and quelled his rebellion, and were rewarded with their fiefdom of Dai. Liu Hu fled west to Shuofang Commandery, where the Han-Zhao emperor, Liu Cong, gave him the title of Duke of Loufan.\nThe Tiefu resided in Shuofang for many years. Liu Hu waged war with Dai but was repeatedly defeated and at one point had to flee the Great Wall. His son, Liu Wuhuan succeeded him in 341 and immediately entered a marriage alliance with Dai. On the other hand, he also submitted to the Jie-led Later Zhao dynasty. His brother Liu Eloutou succeeded him in 356, but was ousted by Wuhuan's son, Liu Xiwuqi in 358. After Xiwuqi died in 359, his brother, Liu Weichen, killed his son and took power.\nWeichen alternated between supporting the Dai and the Di-led Former Qin. In 376, after multiple defeats to Dai, he convinced Qin to launch a campaign against them, with him acting as a guide. Qin conquered Dai that same year, but when dividing up their territory, Weichen was unhappy that Qin deferred more control to his cousin, Liu Kuren of the Dugu tribe, prompting him to rebel. He was defeated and forced to cross the Yellow River west of the Ordos, where he resubmitted to Qin.\nAs the Former Qin collapsed following the Battle of Fei River, Weichen re-occupied Shuofang in 386. Around the same time, the Tuoba had also revived their state, now known as the Northern Wei. The Tiefu initially posed a threat to Wei, but in 392, Weichen was killed and the tribe’s power base was destroyed after a Wei counteroffensive. A son of Weichen, Liu Bobo, went into exile and found protection under the Xianbei, Moyigan of the Poduoluo tribe at Gaoping (in present-day Guyuan, Ningxia).\nIn 402, Moyigan and Liu Bobo fled to the Qiang-led Later Qin under pressure from Wei. During his time in Qin, Bobo caught the attention of its ruler, Yao Xing. Impressed by his appearance and talents, Yao Xing made Bobo a general and assigned him to defend Shuofang, despite warnings from his officials regarding his violent behaviour. In 407, Bobo was angered by peace talks between Qin and Wei, leading him to rebel. After ceasing 8,000 tribute horses from the Rouran, he went to Gaoping and killed Moyigan, taking over his forces.\n\nReign of Helian Bobo\nAs the Xiongnu alleged that they descended from Yu the Great, Liu Bobo claimed descent from the Xia dynasty and founded the state of Great Xia, claiming the titles of Heavenly King and Grand Chanyu. The same year, he led his forces to subjugate the tribes in Shuofang. He briefly fought with the Southern Liang after they rejected a marriage alliance, dealing them a heavy defeat. Despite his grudge against the Northern Wei, Bobo mainly concentrated his military efforts on the Later Qin. He refused to establish a capital in his early reign, instead choosing to lead a roving army and attacking Qin’s northern borders when least expected.\nIn 413, Bobo, believing that it was inappropriate to claim lineage of the Han dynasty through his maternal line, changed his family name from Liu to the prestigious-sounding name of Helian. He also built his capital city of Tongwancheng at the southern edge of the Mu Us Desert. Construction of the city was reportedly brutal, with around 100,000 Han Chinese and tribal people being drafted to build the city. Remains of the city can still be seen today at Jingbian County, Shaanxi. In 414, Helian Bobo entered into an alliance with the Northern Yan in Liaoning, and in 415, with the Northern Liang in Gansu.\nThe war with Xia greatly drained the Qin economy and military, with many of their key generals being killed in battle. In 417, the Eastern Jin commander, Liu Yu, conquered Qin, but the situation back at the Jin capital forced him to return and leave behind his generals to defend the Guanzhong region. In 418, Bobo invaded the Guanzhong, and due to violent infighting among the Jin generals, he inflicted them a catastrophic defeat and captured the region.\n\nIn 419, Helian Bobo elevated himself to Emperor of Xia. Although the ancient capital, Chang’an, was under his control, he set up a Southern Administration there and kept Tongwancheng as his capital out of concern that the Northern Wei would invade the Ordos in his absence. Throughout his reign, Bobo is described in records as an extremely cruel ruler who often killed his subjects on impulse. In 424, a civil war broke out among his sons, which ended in him appointing Helian Chang as his new Crown Prince.\n\nDecline and fall\nAfter Helian Bobo’s death in 425, the Northern Wei intensified their pressure on the Xia. While Helian Chang was away campaigning against the Western Qin, Wei carried out a surprise attack on Xia, capturing many cities in Guanzhong including Chang’an. In 427, as Xia attempted to recapture Chang’an, Wei launched a second attack and captured their capital at the Battle of Tongwancheng. Chang relocated to Shanggui, but after several more defeats, he was finally captured in battle in 428.\nHelian Chang’s brother, Helian Ding, declared himself the new emperor at Pingliang. In 431, as Wei continued their encroachment, he made a last-ditch effort to expand westwards. He conquered the weakened Western Qin, but on his way to invade Northern Liang, he was ambushed and captured by the Tuyuhun. Helian Ding’s capture marked the end of the Xia, and in 432, he was turned over to Wei and executed. In 434, Helian Chang tried to escape west from Pingcheng but was intercepted and killed.\n\nRelations with the Dugu\nLiu Hu's uncle was Liu Meng, who in 272 was killed by the Jin dynasty after he rebelled the previous year. While Hu's father Liu Gaoshengyuan took over their people, Meng's son, Liu Fulun fled to the Tuoba tribe. In 318, Fulun's son, Liu Lugu also surrendered to the Tuoba and was given a daughter by Tuoba Yulü to marry. Fulun's branch became known as the Dugu tribe (獨孤), and like the Tiefu, they were known as Wuhuan people due to their mixed ethnicity.\nYao Weiyuan suggested in the past that 'Dugu' was an alternate form of 'Tuge' (屠各), the Xiongnu aristocratic clan that had adopted the Han Chinese surname of Liu (劉), members of which also ruled the Former Zhao state.

    "text": "Les Cayes ( lay K(A)Y, French: [le kaj]), often referred to as Aux Cayes (French: [o kaj]; Haitian Creole: Okay), is a commune and seaport in the Les Cayes Arrondissement, in the Sud department of Haiti, with a population of 151,696. Due to its isolation from the political turmoil of the capital, Port-au-Prince, it is one of Haiti's major ports, with export trade concentrating on mostly coffee and sugarcane. As the world's largest supplier of vetiver, it exports 250 tons annually of this ingredient of perfume and fragrance manufacturing. Minor exports include bananas and timber.\n\nHistory\nEuropean settlement\nThe island of what was known by the Spanish as Hispaniola was inhabited for thousands of years by indigenous peoples.  The first European settlement in the southwest area was the town of Salvatierra de la Sabana, founded by the Spanish explorer Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar in 1504. Vasco Núñez de Balboa was a co-founder of this town and lived there for several years trying to raise pigs as a business. Balboa gave up that enterprise and left the town hiding in a barrel of a Spanish expedition going to explore the Gulf of Uraba, Panama. Vasco Núñez de Balboa, later on 25 September 1513 would discover the South Sea, today known as the Pacific Ocean. This settlement was abandoned in 1540.\nThe area was uninhabited until the French colonial administration founded the town of Aux Cayes (\"On the cayes\"), so named due to its proximity to Île-à-Vache. The town was destroyed twice by hurricanes in 1781 and 1788. In July 1793, the whites in Les Cayes were massacred.\n\nAsylum for independent insurgencies\nSimón Bolívar arrived in Les Cayes on 24 December 1815, and on 2 January 1816 was introduced to Alexandre Pétion, President of the Republic of Haiti by a mutual friend seeking assistance for his insurgency against the Spanish colonial government in Venezuela. Bolívar and Pétion impressed and befriended each other and, after Bolívar pledged to free every slave in the areas he occupied, Pétion gave him money and military supplies.\nMexican nationalists, Francisco Javier Mina and José Joaquín de Herrera took asylum in Les Cayes and were welcomed by Pétion during the Mexican War of Independence.\n\nUnited States occupation of Haiti\nOn 5 December 5 1919, American planes bombed Les Cayes in a possible act of intimidation. American pilots were investigated for their actions, though none were condemned. These actions were described by anthropologist Jean-Philippe Belleau as possibly \"the first ever carried out by air on civilian populations\".\nPresident Herbert Hoover had become increasingly pressured about the effects of occupying Haiti at the time and began inquiring about a withdrawal strategy. By 1929, Haitians had grown angered with the Borno-Russell government and American occupation, with demands for direct elections increasing. In early December 1929, protests against the American occupation began at the Service Technique de l’Agriculture et de l’Enseignement Professionnel's main school. On December 6, 1929, about 1,500 Haitians peacefully protesting local economic conditions in Les Cayes were fired upon by U.S. Marines, with the massacre resulting in 12 to 22 Haitians dead and 51 injured. The massacre resulted in international outrage, with President Hoover calling on Congress to investigate conditions in Haiti the following day.\n\nNatural disasters\nIn the wake of the 12 January 2010 earthquake, the Cuban military set up a field hospital in the region.\nOn 4 October 2016, Hurricane Matthew made landfall in Les Cayes causing severe damage.\nOn 14 August 2021, a magnitude 7.2 earthquake occurred near the city. It was the largest earthquake to strike Haiti in modern history, even stronger than the 2010 earthquake near the Haitian capital. The earthquake killed over 2,200 people and injured around 12,700 others, most of them in Les Cayes and its surrounding areas.\n\nTourism\nLes Cayes plays a significant role in the still under-developed Haitian tourism industry, with pleasant sights such as:\nGelée Beach: one of the longest and most visited beaches in Haiti. The white sand beach of Gelée beach is very popular in Haiti, not only for its restaurants which serve typical southern Haiti dishes such as tonm-tonm, grilled-conch, grilled-fish and lobster, but also for hosting an annual music festival around mid-August which usually features some of the best Compas music bands. Many visitors both from within Haiti and neighboring USA will come spend the weekend in Les Cayes. As the number of tourists continues to grow, several new hotels and restaurants continue to pop up.\nThe Botanical Garden of Les Cayes  (Jardin Botanique des Cayes, in French) is located in Bergeau, at the northern entrance of the city. The site occupies an area of eight (8) hectares.\nOther places of interest to tourists are the nearby Île à Vache, Pic Macaya, Saut-Mathurine falls and Kounoubois cave in Camp-Perrin, Pointe-de-Sable beach in Port-Salut, Marie-Jeanne cave in Port-a-Piment and   Arrondissement Aquin where Fort des Oliviers, Fort Anglais and Bonnet Carré can be found in the town of Saint Louis du Sud.\n\nFacilities\nAirport\nLes Cayes has an airport, Antoine-Simon Airport. In 2013, the first stone on the expansion project of the Antoine-Simon Airport in Les Cayes was laid. The project to make Antoine-Simon a viable international airport is part of broader efforts aiming at ramping up infrastructure development in the south.\nThe airport projected was completed in 2025, increasing the length of the runway to 1,850 meters (6,069 feet), increasing aircraft capacity, adding new lighting, a weather station, a control tower, and space for an Anti-Drug Trafficking Brigade. The overall cost of the project was $26.44 million. At the time that the project began, Haitian officials Prime Minister Laurent Lamothe and Tourism Minister Stéphanie Villedrouin suggested that the airport would open up completely the Southern Region as the country saw tourism as one of the promising sectors capable of creating thousands of new jobs in the region. In the context of Haiti's ongoing crisis, infrastructure in the south of Haiti has gained new importance, as the highways connecting the region to the rest of the country are under gang control. \nThe expanded airport received its first international passenger flight on November 10, 2025, an IBC Airways flight from Miami.\nAnother airport project is also planned for the neighbouring island of Île-à-Vache.\n\nUniversity\nLes Cayes has some training centers of which The American University of the Caribbean, Haiti; The Public University of The South in Les Cayes, (UPSAC); and \nThe Law and Economics School of Les Cayes (EDSEC).\n\nHospital\nHôpital Immaculée Conception (Immaculate Conception Hospital, also referred to as HIC-Cayes), is the public hospital for Les Cayes and the South Department. Its facilities include an emergency department, maternity ward, and a dental clinic.\n\nSport\nLes Cayes is home to professional football clubs, America des Cayes and FC Juventus des Cayes.\n\nNotable natives and residents\nJohn James Audubon, French-American naturalist\nEuphémie Daguilh, Royal mistress to the Haitian emperor Jean-Jacques Dessalines\nJean Joseph Maurice Dartigue (1903-1983), Minister of Public Instruction, Labor, and Agriculture from 1941 until 1945\nAuguste Davezac, United States Ambassador to the Netherlands\nAndré Corvington, Olympic fencer\nAndré Rigaud, Haitian revolutionary leader, was born here on a plantation.\nAssotto Saint, writer and artist\nHorace Pauleus Sannon (1870-1938) was a Haitian historian and politician and presidential candidate in 1926 and 1930\nJean Ernest Muscadin, Haitian prosecutor in Miragoâne\nPierre-Théoma Boisrond-Canal (1832-1905), President of Haiti (1876-1879, 1888, 1892)\nFrançois-Wolff Ligondé (1928-2013), Archbishop of Port-au-Prince\nJacques Nicolas Léger (1859-1918), Haitian lawyer, politician, diplomat, and writer\nLysius Salomon (1815-1888), 13th President of Haiti (1879-1888)\nMichel Domingue (1813-1877), President of Haiti (1874-1876)\nHérard Dumesle (1784-1858), Haitian poet and politician\nFrançois C.

Until 2024 the building was on long-term lease to the BBC, latterly being used to house BBC Radio 2 and BBC Radio 6 Music. It is located on the junction of Gildea Street and Great Portland Street adjacent to the BBC's headquarters, Broadcasting House. Originally named Western House, on 16 November 2016 the building was renamed Wogan House after the Irish broadcaster Sir Terry Wogan, who had died in January that year, and broadcast his final Wake up to Wogan breakfast show from the building in December 2009.\n\nHistory\nThe building has been used by the BBC since at least 1953. For a long period, the upper floors were occupied by the BBC's Engineering Designs Department, with the ground floor being occupied firstly by a car showroom and latterly being used for the BBC's Recorded Sound Effects Library. During this period, the building became the UK base for the first transatlantic colour television satellite communications. The BBC Engineering Designs Department was restructured in the late 1980s and subsequently vacated Western House in 1987.\nFollowing extensive renovation in the early to mid-2000s, its main use from 2006 to 2024 was as the base of BBC Radio 2 and BBC Radio 6 Music, although it also housed several smaller radio studios for use by other BBC stations as well as a gym, bar and bistro for use by members of the BBC Club and guests.\nOn 2 November 2022, it was announced that the BBC would be moving out of the building, relocating Radio 2 and 6 Music back to BBC Broadcasting House, by spring 2024. The final 6 Music show from the building, hosted by Gideon Coe, was broadcast on 11 February 2024. The final Radio 2 show, and radio show from the building altogether, was hosted by Paul Gambaccini, on 18 February 2024. After reflecting on notable resident DJs of Wogan House, Gambaccini quoted playwright Arthur Miller: \"all that's left are memories of voices in the air\". The final song played for BBC Radio 2 in the studio was The Floral Dance, sung by the building's namesake, Terry Wogan.\nLate in 2024, Wogan House will get a new life opening up flexible office space\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "William Donald Nyrop (July 23, 1952 – December 31, 1995) was an American professional ice hockey player. He played 207 games in the National Hockey League with the Montreal Canadiens and Minnesota North Stars from 1976 to 1982. He won the Stanley Cup with the Canadiens three times, in 1976, 1977, and 1978. Internationally Nyrop played for the American national team at the 1976 Canada Cup, where he served as captain.\n\nEarly life\nNyrop was born in Washington, D.C., and his father, Donald Nyrop, served as U.S. Administrator of Civil Aeronautics (now the Federal Aviation Administration) and Chairman of the U.S. Civil Aeronautics Board (now National Transportation Safety Board) under President Harry S. Truman in the early 1950s. Donald Nyrop moved his family to Edina, Minnesota, where he served as president, CEO and chairman of the board of Northwest Airlines from 1954–1976. As a boy, Nyrop attended Edina High School, where he was an all-star athlete, playing quarterback for an undefeated football team and leading the hockey team to the state title in 1969.\nAfter graduation from high school in 1970, Nyrop attended the University of Notre Dame. He tried out for the Notre Dame football team in 1971 and won a spot on the roster as the backup quarterback. However, he was injured in practice and never played for the team, instead playing hockey during his four years in college. After his sophomore year with the Fighting Irish in 1971–72, Nyrop was selected 66th overall by the Montreal Canadiens at the 1972 NHL Amateur Draft. He attended his first pro training camp in September 1972, and in 1973 he was voted on to the WCHA first all-star team and the NCAA west first all-American team. The next year, he represented the United States at the \"B\" Pool Ice Hockey World Championship where he was named to the tournament All-Star team as the best defenseman.\n\nPro career\nDuring his first pro season with the American Hockey League's Nova Scotia Voyageurs in 1974–75, Nyrop played with the stability of a seasoned veteran. He made his National Hockey League (NHL) debut the next year on February 22, 1976 with the Montreal Canadiens, dressing for 19 games and became a regular on defense in the playoffs as the Canadiens won the Stanley Cup. Later that year Nyrop scored two points in five games and was stalwart on the defense as team captain for the United States team at the inaugural 1976 Canada Cup. Nyrop spent two years on the Montreal defense and helped the team win the Stanley Cup in 1977 and 1978. After the 1977–78 season, Nyrop stepped away from the game to study law. His rights were traded by the Canadiens to the Minnesota North Stars in September 1980 and he returned to the NHL a year later. He dressed for 42 regular season games with the Stars and two post-season contests in which his team was upset by Chicago in the first round. Nyrop also played briefly for Kölner Haie of the German league in 1982–83 before retiring for good.\n\nPost career\nAfter retirement, Nyrop attended Gonzaga University School of Law in Spokane, Washington, earning his Juris Doctor (J.D.) in 1986. He set up his law practice, but then returned to hockey as the coach of the Knoxville Cherokees of the East Coast Hockey League (ECHL) in 1991-92. The following season, Nyrop became owner and coach of the Sunshine Hockey League's West Palm Beach Blaze. After guiding the club to three straight league championships, he sold his interest in the club due to failing health. In September 1995, Nyrop was diagnosed with inoperable colon cancer, which had spread to his liver and lungs. He died three months later in his father's home in Minneapolis at age 43.\n\nCareer statistics\nRegular season and playoffs\nInternational\nAwards and honors\nStanley Cup champion in 1976, 1977 and 1978\nMember of the 1978 National Hockey League All-Star team\nWEC-B All-Star Team in 1974\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nBiographical information and career statistics from NHL.com, or Eliteprospects.com, or Hockey-Reference.com, or The Internet Hockey Database",

This includes use together with oral rehydration therapy for children who have diarrhea. General use is not recommended. It may be taken by mouth or by injection into a vein.\nSide effects may include abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, and feeling tired. While normal doses are deemed safe in pregnancy and breastfeeding, the safety of larger doses is unclear. Greater care should be taken in those with kidney problems. Zinc is an essential mineral in people as well as other animals.\nThe medical use of zinc sulfate began as early as the 1600s. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Zinc sulfate is available as a generic medication. and over the counter.\n\nMedical uses\nThe use of zinc sulfate supplements together with oral rehydration therapy decreases the number of bowel movements and the time until the diarrhea stops. Its use in this situation is recommended by the World Health Organization.\nThere is some evidence zinc is effective in reducing hepatic and neurological symptoms of Wilson's disease.\nZinc sulfate is also an important part of parenteral nutrition.\n\nMisuse\nDuring the 1918 flu pandemic in New Zealand, inhalation chambers were set up in towns and cities as a means to boost immunity. The public were encouraged to attend these chambers and inhale a zinc sulfate mist, a process that was said to disinfect the lungs and throat and protect against infection. In reality, the inhalation of hot steam could inflame the nasal tissue, potentially making participants more susceptible to infection. \nIn towns such as Ashburton, New Zealand for example, in order to be eligible to travel by train, people had to present documentation at the train station proving that they had been through the inhalation chamber.\nThe inhalation chamber which was set up in the old Dunedin Post Office building was described as follows: \"It was a small room, relatively airtight, holding 20 or 30 persons, and the air is impregnated with the vapour of zinc sulphate. Each batch remains in the chamber for 10 minutes, and the persons treated are instructed to breathe through the nose at first, and then through the mouth.\"\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\"Zinc Sulfate\".

The species is endemic to Baja California and adjacent southern California.\n\nEtymology\nThe specific name, copeii, is in honor of American herpetologist and paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope.\n\nDescription\nGambelia copeii is between 8 and 14 cm (3.1 and 5.5 in) in snout-to-vent length (SVL), and has a smoky gray color and darker gray or black dorsal spots, edged in a lighter shade. The dorsal pattern appears mottled or ocellated. There are light crossbars on the dorsum, and light gray or white on the venter. It has small granular scales. The large head is distinct from the neck, and the lining of the mouth and throat is purplish-black. Juvenile lizards are similar to adults, but have more distinct banding across the dorsum. Females develop red-orange blotches on the ventral side during breeding season. Males have femoral pores.\n\nBiology\nThe Baja California leopard lizard is an uncommon species. It is a powerful bipedal runner. An adult can inflict a painful bite. It prefers chaparral habitats with an open understory.\n\nSources\nThis article is based on a description from the website of Robert N. Fisher and Ted J.

    "title": "Battle of Beaver Dam Creek",
    "text": "The Battle of Beaver Dam Creek, also known as the Battle of Mechanicsville or Ellerson's Mill, took place on June 26, 1862, in Hanover County, Virginia. It was the first major engagement of the Seven Days Battles during the Peninsula Campaign of the American Civil War and the start of Confederate General Robert E. Lee's counter-offensive against the Union Army of the Potomac, under Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, which threatened the Confederate capital of Richmond.\nLee attempted to turn the Union right flank, north of the Chickahominy River, with troops under Maj. Gen. Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson, but Jackson failed to arrive on time. Instead, Maj. Gen. A.P. Hill threw his division, reinforced by one of Maj. Gen. D.H. Hill's brigades, into a series of futile assaults against Brig. Gen. Fitz John Porter's V Corps, which occupied defensive works behind Beaver Dam Creek. Confederate attacks were driven back with heavy casualties. Porter withdrew his corps safely to Gaines Mill, with the exception of Company F (\"The Hopewell Rifles\") of the 8th Pennsylvania Reserve Regiment who did not receive the orders to retreat.\n\nBackground and Lee's plan\nMilitary situation\nAfter the Battle of Seven Pines, on May 31 and June 1, McClellan and the Army of the Potomac sat passively at the outskirts of Richmond for almost a month. Lee, newly appointed commander of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, devoted this period to reorganizing his army and preparing a counter-attack. He also sent for reinforcements. Stonewall Jackson arrived on June 25 from the Shenandoah Valley following his successful Valley Campaign. He brought four divisions: his own, now commanded by Brig. Gen. Charles S. Winder, and those of Maj. Gen. Richard S. Ewell, Brig. Gen. William H. C. Whiting, and Maj. Gen. D.H. Hill.\nThe Union Army straddled the rain-swollen Chickahominy River. Four of the Army's five corps were arrayed in a semicircular line south of the river. The V Corps under Brig. Gen. Porter was north of the river near Mechanicsville in an L-shaped line running north–south behind Beaver Dam Creek and southeast along the Chickahominy. Lee moved most of his army north of the Chickahominy to attack the Union north flank. He left only two divisions (under Maj. Gens. Benjamin Huger and John B. Magruder) to face the Union main body. This concentrated about 65,000 troops against 30,000, leaving only 25,000 to protect Richmond against the other 60,000 men of the Union army. It was a risky plan that required careful execution, but Lee knew that he could not win in a battle of attrition or siege against the Union army. The Confederate cavalry under Brig. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart had reconnoitered Porter's right flank as part of a daring circumnavigation of the entire Union army from June 12 to June 15 and found it vulnerable. Stuart's forces burned a couple of Union supply ships and was able to report much of McClellan's army's strength and position to Gen. Lee. McClellan was aware of Jackson's arrival and presence at Ashland Station, but did nothing to reinforce Porter's vulnerable corps north of the river.\nLee's plan called for Jackson to begin the attack on Porter's north flank early on June 26. Maj. Gen. A.P. Hill's Light Division was to advance from Meadow Bridge when he heard Jackson's guns, clear the Union pickets from Mechanicsville, and then move to Beaver Dam Creek. The divisions of Maj. Gens. D.H. Hill and James Longstreet were to pass through Mechanicsville, D.H. Hill to support Jackson and Longstreet to support A.P. Hill. Lee expected Jackson's flanking movement to force Porter to abandon his line behind the creek, and so A. P. Hill and Longstreet would not have to attack Union entrenchments. South of the Chickahominy, Magruder and Huger were to demonstrate, deceiving the four Union corps on their front.\n\nOpposing forces\nUnion\nConfederate\nBattle\nLee's intricate plan went awry immediately. Jackson's men, fatigued from their recent campaign and lengthy march, ran at least four hours behind schedule. By 3 p.m., A.P. Hill grew impatient and began his attack without orders. Hill's division, minus Brig. Gen Lawrence O'Bryan Branch's brigade, which was placed off to the north to link up with Jackson, entered Mechanicsville and skirmished with George McCall's Union division, deployed around the town. McCall fell back to an easily defensible spot on the opposite side of Beaver Dam Creek. There, the brigades of Brig. Gen John F. Reynolds and Brig. Gen Truman Seymour dug in, with Brig. Gen George G. Meade's brigade placed behind them in reserve, Reynolds' brigade to the north and Seymour's to the south. On Reynolds' right, the divisions of Brig. Gen George Morell and Brig. Gen George Sykes formed a semicircle. Supporting the roughly 26,000 Union infantrymen were 32 artillery pieces. There, 14,000 well entrenched infantry, supported by 32 guns in six batteries, repulsed repeated Confederate attacks with substantial casualties.\nJackson and his command arrived late in the afternoon. However, unable to find A.P. Hill or D.H. Hill, Jackson did nothing. Although a major battle was raging within earshot, he ordered his troops to make camp for the evening. Hill's 11,000 men, most of them green regiments who had never fired a shot in battle, launched a series of futile attacks over the next few hours. The brigade of John R. Anderson assaulted the Union right flank, with James Archer's and Charles W. Field's brigades in support. Maxcy Gregg's brigade was held in reserve and did not participate in the battle at all. Directing his troops, John Reynolds gestured at the oncoming mass of Confederates and told a staffer \"There they come like flies on a piece of gingerbread.\" The Union artillery and musketry tore enormous gaps in the Confederate lines as they attempted to cross the creek. Although A.P. Hill had 24 guns with him, he made no attempt to use massed artillery fire to counter the Union gunners, instead sending individual batteries in support of the infantry, most of which were quickly put out of action by enemy shelling.\nSome of Anderson's men managed to get across the creek and momentarily threaten Reynolds's position, however he was reinforced by Meade's brigade and two regiments from Morell's division. The three Confederate brigades were driven back with substantial casualties. Arriving on the field and realizing what was happening, Robert E. Lee hastily summoned Longstreet's and D.H. Hill's divisions. As Lee surveyed the futile attacks, Jefferson Davis and the Confederate cabinet rode up to him. Davis asked him \"General, what is all this army and what is it doing here?\" Lee replied sarcastically \"I don't know, Mr. President. It is not my army and this is no place for it.\" William D. Pender's brigade then attacked the Union left flank at Ellerson's Mill, held by Seymour's brigade. Once again, the well-entrenched infantry and massed artillery proved too much for the Confederates and Pender was forced to retreat. Just then, Roswell Ripley's brigade of D.H. Hill's division arrived on the field and was ordered next to assault the Union left. Ripley charged head-on into the Union entrenchments and suffered the very worst of all with over 600 casualties, the largest percentage of them coming from the 44th Georgia, which lost 335 men and most of its officers (out of a total of 514), including its colonel Robert A. Smith, a roughly 65% casualty rate. The 1st North Carolina suffered 50% casualties (133 men killed, wounded, or captured) and also lost its commander, Col. Montford Stokes. General Ripley himself survived unscathed, but came within inches of being decapitated by an artillery shell. Ripley's other two regiments, the 3rd North Carolina and 48th Georgia, were to the rear of the 1st North Carolina and 44th Georgia; their losses were lighter. Union casualties around Ellerson's Mill were small, only 40 men total were killed or wounded in the 7th Pennsylvania Reserves and 12th Pennsylvania Reserves, which were defending this sector of the battlefield. The 13th Pennsylvania Reserves lost 75 men, the highest total number of any Union outfit. Some 20 years after the battle, D.H. Hill wrote \"The attacks on the Beaver Dam entrenchments, on the heights of Malvern Hill, at Gettysburg, were all grand, but of exactly the kind of grandeur the South could not afford.\"\nAs darkness fell, the rest of D.H. Hill's division came up followed by Longstreet, while on the Union side, George Morrell's division arrived and relieved McCall, whose men were nearly out of ammunition. There was not enough daylight remaining to deploy D.H. Hill and Longstreet's divisions. Jackson did not attack, but his presence near Porter's flank caused McClellan to order Porter to withdraw after dark behind Boatswain's Swamp, five miles (8 km) to the east. McClellan was concerned that the Confederate buildup on his right flank threatened his supply line, the Richmond and York River Railroad north of the Chickahominy, and he decided to shift his base of supply to the James River (he also believed that the demonstrations by Huger and Magruder showed that he was seriously outnumbered). This was a strategic decision of grave import because it meant that, without the railroad to supply his army, he had to abandon his siege of Richmond.\n\nAftermath\nOverall, the battle was a Union victory \"by any definition\", in which the Confederates suffered heavy casualties and achieved none of their specific objectives due to the seriously flawed execution of Lee's plan. Instead of over 60,000 men crushing the enemy's flank, only five brigades, about 15,000 men, had seen action. Their losses were 1,484 versus Porter's 361. Lee's staff recalled that he was \"deeply, bitterly disappointed\" by Jackson's performance, but communication breakdowns, poorly written orders from Lee, and bad judgment by most of Lee's other subordinates were also to blame.\nCompany F of the 8th Pennsylvania Reserve Regiment (also referred to as The Hopewell Rifles) from Bedford County, PA was not informed of the orders to retreat after being sent ahead to skirmish. They were consequently captured by the Confederates, and held as prisoners at both Belle Isle and Castle Thunder.\nDespite the Union tactical success, however, it was the start of a strategic debacle and the unraveling of the Peninsula Campaign. McClellan began to withdraw his army to the southeast and never regained the initiative. The next day the Seven Days Battles continued as Lee attacked Porter at the Battle of Gaines's Mill.\n\nSee also\nTroop engagements of the American Civil War, 1862\nList of costliest American Civil War land battles\nRichmond in the Civil War\nVirginia in the American Civil War\nList of American Civil War battles\nList of Virginia Civil War units\n\nNotes\nReferences\nEicher, David J.

    "text": "The Laughing Place is a traditional African American folktale, featuring Br'er Rabbit, Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear. It is famous for its inclusion among Joel Chandler Harris' Uncle Remus stories.\n\nSummary\nFollowing Br'er Rabbit's capture, the hero leads his captors, wily Br'er Fox and dim-witted Br'er Bear, to his \"laughin' place\". Out of curiosity, they let him lead the way, only for Br'er Rabbit to walk them straight into a cavern of bees. While the antagonists are stung, Br'er Rabbit escapes.\nThis story can be traced to African trickster tales, particularly the hare that figures prominently in the storytelling traditions in Western Africa, Central Africa, and Southern Africa. In the Akan traditions of West Africa, the trickster is usually the spider (see Anansi), though the plots of tales of the spider are often identical with those of stories of Br'er Rabbit.\n\nIn popular culture\nThe story was used in the 1946 film Song of the South along with \"The Tar Baby\" and \"The Briar Patch\". It is also referenced in a dark ride scene of Splash Mountain, a log flume-style attraction based on Song of the South at Tokyo Disneyland and formerly at Disneyland and Magic Kingdom.\nThe term \"The Laughing Place\" is also used in the Stephen King novel Misery and the second season of the series Castle Rock.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "New York State Route 52",
    "text": "New York State Route 52 (NY 52) is a 108.72-mile-long (174.97 km) state highway in the southeastern part of the state. It generally runs from west to east through five counties, beginning at the Pennsylvania state line in the Delaware River near Narrowsburg, crossing the Hudson River on the Newburgh–Beacon Bridge, and ending in Carmel. NY 52 and NY 55, both major east–west routes of the Mid-Hudson Region, run parallel to each other, intersecting in downtown Liberty.\nWith the exception of the section overlapping Interstate 84 (I-84), most of Route 52 is a two-lane road through lightly developed rural areas. The road west of the Hudson River serves a number of small communities in the southern Catskills and Hudson Valley, such as the villages of Jeffersonville, Ellenville and Walden. East of the Hudson, it closely parallels I-84 after leaving it at the village of Fishkill. It once passed through the cities of Newburgh and Beacon, following a ferry between them, but since the bridge's construction Route 52 runs concurrently with I-84 just to their north.\nMuch of what is today Route 52 was built as private turnpikes in the early 19th century. After their operating companies folded later in the century, the state took over the roads in the 1890s. While some portions of today's Route 52 were included in New York's first designations of state highways, it was not until a 1930 renumbering that Route 52 took that number.\nAt that time it followed most of its present alignment, but continued east of its present terminus to NY 22. The truncation to its junction with US 6 in Carmel came later in the 1930s, along with an exchange of alignments between routes 52 and 216. When the Newburgh-Beacon Bridge was opened in the early 1960s, Route 52 was rerouted onto I-84, bypassing a route to the ferry landings in Newburgh and Beacon. The alignment to I-84 in the latter city is today Route 52 Business.\n\nRoute description\nSullivan County\nA little over half of NY 52's total mileage is in Sullivan County, due to its circuitous route in the less developed western half of the county, where some segments are maintained by the county rather than the state. East of Liberty, the route takes a more direct course toward its highest elevation, in the part of the county that is more dominated by resorts and summer camps.\n\nNarrowsburg to Jeffersonville\nNY 52 begins at the midpoint of the Narrowsburg–Darbytown Bridge over the Delaware River as a county-maintained continuation of PA 652 (Beach Lake Highway). Co-designated as County Route 24 (CR 24), NY 52 proceeds southeast through the hamlet of Narrowsburg in the town of Tusten as the two-lane Bridge Street. After crossing over Norfolk Southern's Southern Tier Line, NY 52 and CR 24 pass St. Francis Xavier Cemetery and then leave the center of Narrowsburg, merging with NY 97 south of Feagles Lake. County maintenance ends at this point.\n\nThe two routes soon bend eastward to a junction where NY 52 turns northward on a county-maintained roadway. Now co-designated as CR 111, NY 52 bends northeast through Tusten, remaining a two-lane rural roadway as it climbs slightly out of the river valley. The surrounding landscape is mostly forested, with occasional farm clearings. A mile from that junction, NY 52 and CR 111 reach the small hamlet of Lava, crossing the northern terminus of CR 25 (Eckes Road). Continuing northeast out of Lava, the two routes continue past Beaver Pond and then descend into the Tenmile River valley. A short distance later, NY 52 crosses into the town of Cochecton, where CR 111 terminates and NY 52 becomes concurrent with CR 112.\n\nNY 52 continues northeast through Cochecton, reaching the hamlet of Cochecton Center. After passing through, NY 52 and CR 112 turn straight northwest for 0.8 miles (1.3 km) through Cochecton at a junction with CR 115 (Browntown Road). At the second junction with Kelly Road, the route turns north for a half-mile (800 m), turning westward at Buff Road to reach the southern shore of Lake Huntington. The routes turn north along the western shore, entering the eponymous hamlet and reaching the eastern terminus of CR 116. At this junction, CR 112 ends, and NY 52 becomes maintained as CR 113.\nCR 113 and NY 52 turn northeast briefly along the northern shore of the lake, then leaving it and continuing northeast through Cochecton. Farms begin to break up the forest cover around the road more extensively here. At the junction with Shortcut Road, NY 52 turns to the north, reaching a junction in a half-mile with NY 17B and the eastern terminus of CR 114 (Newburgh Turnpike). At this junction, the small hamlet of Fosterdale, NY 17B turns north and joins NY 52, which becomes state-maintained again. The routes continue northward for 2,000 feet (610 m), where they split. NY 17B turns northwest along CR 117; NY 52 bends northeast and soon northward as a state-maintained highway.\n\nAfter crossing the Delaware town line, NY 52 bends east past a residential section around Pine Lake. At Mueller Road, NY 52 turns north and begins to run along the shore of Kenoza Lake. At the northern end of the lake, NY 52 reaches the hamlet of Kenoza Lake. The route turns northwest out of the small lakeside community, continuing north. Crossing the East Branch of Callicoon Creek, which it will follow to its source, NY 52 passes the southern end of Stone Arch Bridge Historic Park. After the bridge, NY 52 reaches the eastern terminus of NY 52A. NY 52 turns northeast along the creek, soon turning northward. The surrounding valley is now mostly cleared farmland. Two miles (3.2 km) from the NY 52A junction, NY 52 reaches the hamlet of Kohlertown.\n\nJeffersonville, Liberty, and Woodbourne\nJust north of Kohlertown, NY 52 reaches a junction with the terminus of CR 164 (Beechwood Road). One block later, CR 128 (Jeffersonville North Branch Road) forks off to the northwest. At this junction, NY 52 turns northeast and crosses the town line into Callicoon. Here, this is also the boundary of Jeffersonville, the first village along the route.\n\nNY 52 enters downtown Jeffersonville on East Main Street, with parking along both sides. It turns east at a junction with Center Street then bends southeast out of the village, following the northern shore of Lake Jefferson. Beyond the lake, the route bends northeast past a junction with CR 144 (Briscoe Road) then continues along the headwaters of the East Branch.\nAt the junction with Hemmer Road, NY 52 bends northeast and soon eastward into the hamlet of Youngsville. There, it passes numerous residences, crosses over the creek and intersects the southern terminus of CR 149 (Shandelee Road). A half-mile west, the route crosses into the town of Liberty, slowly gaining elevation as the East Branch's valley narrows. Turning slightly southeast, NY 52 enters the hamlet of White Sulphur Springs, which it soon leaves after passing a local park.\nNY 52 continues winding southeast through a landscape with less farms and more forest, the surrounding hills growing increasingly higher and steeper. After passing south of the hamlet of Loomis, the route bends northeast again reaches the village of Liberty, the largest community thus far along NY 52. It turns due-east and follows Chestnut Street into the village. As the route becomes more commercial, NY 52 turns southeast at the intersection with North Main Street in the center of Liberty. Two village blocks later, NY 55 (Lake Street) joins it at the historic Munson Diner. The overlap goes to a roundabout 700 feet (210 m) to the east, where the two routes fork. NY 52 continues southeast along Mill Street, passing through an industrial section of Liberty before reaching a second roundabout. At this junction, the route connects with an off-ramp from the eastbound NY 17 expressway, now also Interstate 86.\nParalleling NY 17, NY 52 continues south a short distance through an undeveloped area outside the village, then turns southeast to its actual exit with the freeway. At a junction with CR 175 (Old Route 17). NY 52 passes through a commercial strip mall section of Liberty, south of the Grossinger Country Club. Now on the Catskill Plateau, at elevations over 1,000 feet (300 m) above sea level, the route becomes rural again. Two and a half miles from Route 17 it bends northeast into the town of Fallsburg near a junction with CR 51 (Hilldale Road). Turning southeast again, NY 52 soon reaches a junction with CR 105 (Divine Corners Road). Turning southeast further, the route passes the northern entrance road Sullivan County Community College, the highest elevation on its entire length at 1,531 feet (467 m), and then descends to the hamlet of Loch Sheldrake.\nCrossing through the center of the hamlet, the route passes just south of the actual Loch Sheldrake, then reaches an intersection with CR 104 (Loch Sheldrake Hurleyville Road), the center of the small community. At the eastern end of the hamlet, the route passes north of Evens Lake. NY 52 turns east again, through increasingly wooded countryside, soon changing over to a commercial-residential road and running southeast for a short distance. The route soon bends northeast as it descends toward the hamlet of Woodbourne, where NY 42 joins Route 52 from the south.\nThe two routes curve past residences to Woodbourne's small downtown, then cross the Neversink River. Immediately east of that bridge, NY 42 turns north toward Grahamsville, ending the brief concurrency. NY 52 turns southeast past Woodbourne Correctional Facility to the south, over the south side of a small unnamed hill and then into Ulster County approximately one mile to the east.\n\nUlster County\nNow in the town of Wawarsing, NY 52 bends southeast into an area that remains heavily forested along the next 10 miles (16 km) as it gradually descends off the Catskill Plateau to Ellenville. The route follows a straight course to the southeast past the small residential hamlet of Dairyland, passing a junction with CR 53A (Milk Road). Four miles (6.4 km) further east, it passes another similar small hamlet, Greenfield Park, and bends back to the east a mile after passing the north end of Windsor Lake.\nNY 52 leaves Dairyland, crossing southeast through Wawarsing into the residential hamlet of Greenfield Park and past Windsor Lake, the source of the West Branch of the Beer Kill, which it follows to Ellenville. East of the lake, the route bends northeastward for two more miles, crossing through some dense woods between steep hillsides and paralleling Old Greenfield Road. Both roads soon bend northward, as the woods recede to more residences. As the West Branch drains into the main Beer Kill, just outside Ellenville, NY 52 reaches a junction with CR 53 (Briggs Street).\n\nAfter re-paralleling, NY 52 continues southeast, reaching the terminus of CR 53 (Old Greenfield Road). Entering Ellenville, the largest village on the route since Liberty, NY 52 divides. NY 52 runs down both Center Street and Canal Street. A few blocks into the village, NY 52 has its only intersection in Ulster County with a numbered route above the county level, US 209 (Main Street). The Shawangunk Ridge looms ahead. The route, on both Canal and Center, then crosses the village's downtown, 1,200 feet (370 m) lower than its peak at SCCC. In the residential section that follows the Sandburg Creek crossing, one of the cross streets, Towpath Lane, marks the former route of the Delaware and Hudson Canal, a National Historic Landmark. NY 52 bends southward, where Canal and Center Streets merge, taking the latter's name. At the village line, it becomes Mountain Avenue.\nOver the next three miles (4.8 km), NY 52 climbs over a thousand feet (300 m) to the crest of the Shawangunk Ridge. This section offers several overlooks on the west side with views of the Catskills to the north and northwest and the valley below. The route itself passes rock outcrops, some with fencing to prevent the road from being blocked off, and steep wooded slopes. Near the base of the climb aqua paint blazes on signposts at the roadside indicate the brief presence of the Long Path hiking trail.\n\nNear the top of the ridge, signs point north on CR 104 (Cragsmoor Road)   to the hamlet of Cragsmoor, as NY 52 reaches the apex of the ridge, at 1,480 feet (450 m) in elevation having regained almost all the altitude lost on the way to Ellenville. As it begins to descend through dense woods of scrub oak, NY 52 enters the town of Shawangunk, very near the Sullivan County line. Shortly afterward, a clearing at a house below one bend in the steep road offers a panoramic view east, towards the Hudson River with the Hudson Highlands also visible. The route winds southeast and levels out at the hamlet of Walker Valley, having descended 910 feet (280 m) from the heights of the ridge.\nJust southeast of Walker Valley, NY 52 crosses a junction with CR 65 (Weed Road). The brief breaks in the forest cover from the hamlet end. A mile beyond, NY 52 turns east, then bends northeast. At Verkeerderkill Park, CR 7 (Burlingham Road), merges in from the southeast. Here more cleared farmland begins to break up the forest. At the junction with New Prospect and Pirog roads, CR 7 turns off northeast, following the former. NY 52 turns southeast and, three-quarters of a mile (1.21 km) later, crosses the Orange County line at Shawangunk Kill.\n\nOrange County\nAcross the bridge is the large hamlet of Pine Bush, part of the town of Crawford. NY 52's first intersection is the northern terminus of NY 302 (Maple Avenue). Known as Main Street, NY 52 crosses southeast through downtown Pine Bush for its next half-mile (800 m). The countryside beyond is primarily farms with some woodlots, the gently rolling terrain offering views north to the upper Shawangunks.\n\nThree-quarters of a mile past Pine Bush, CR 89 (Hill Avenue) forks off to the southeast. Afterwards a slight descent heralds the Dwaar Kill crossing, the route remains a two-lane rural roadway through northern Orange County. A rise through a more wooded area culminates in the Montgomery town line at CR 17 (Fleury Road), where the landscape opens up again.\nContinuing straight southeast past farms and some newer subdivisions, the route reaches CR 14 (Albany Post Road). At Rider Road, a half-mile further on, NY 52 curves further to the southeast, taking it across a wide swath of farmland into the village of Walden, the largest settlement along the route. It follows first residential North Montgomery Street, which becomes South Montgomery Street at the Oak Street intersection, marked by a few small businesses.\nAt the junction with Walker Street, NY 52 turns sharply eastward, becoming West Main Street while South Montgomery Street continues towards the village of Montgomery via CR 29. Immediately following this turn, NY 52 crosses the Walden Veterans' Memorial Bridge over the Wallkill River, entering the center of Walden. Conspicuous here is the brick tower of Walden United Methodist Church. After several blocks, West Main reaches an intersection with local Bank Street on the north, NY 208 (Ulster Avenue) ahead, and Main Street to the southeast. It joins NY 208 on Main.\n\nThe two routes fork a short two blocks later at Orange Avenue, which NY 208 follows toward Maybrook while NY 52 continues east as East Main Street. A quarter-mile (400 m) beyond, at the first of the route's several crossings of Wallkill tributary Tin Brook, the houses on the north side of the road start to have a deep setback, reflecting a past division of NY 52 at this point. The second roadway remains in use from Woodruff Avenue to the village's eastern boundary.\nPast Walden, NY 52 passes several businesses, then Wallkill Valley Cemetery on the south. A mile west of there, just past another crossing of Tin Brook, CR 85 (St. Andrew's Road), leaves from the north. Past East Walden, the route becomes a two-lane rural road, bending southeast at a junction with Old South Plank Road. The landscape remains the same gently rolling countryside of worked fields it was between Walden and Pine Bush.\nThe last two crossings of Tin Brook, a mile and a half (2.4 km) east of CR 85 precede a bend to the southeast. The woods on the side of the road increase here as NY 52 climbs slightly after the Catskill Aqueduct crosses a half-mile from that turn. In another half-mile, the route returns to its more easterly course as it enters the town of Newburgh and takes the name South Plank Road at the intersection with Old South Plank Road and Cooks Lane.\nAfter passing a swampy area in the woods to the north, NY 52 intersects CR 23 (Rock Cut Road), then runs through swamps along the southern shore of Orange Lake on an eastward heading. Immediately afterwards, a single intersection marks the very small commercial center of the hamlet of Orange Lake. Just past the hamlet, NY 52 turns southeast again at a junction with Monarch Drive and enters an area where woods screen residential neighborhoods off the route. It is paralleled on the north by Bushfield Creek, which drains Orange Lake. With both the creek and route going past a large hill on the south, NY 52 bends southeast again to cross under the New York State Thruway (I-87).\nA commercial strip begins shortly after the Thruway, continuing a half-mile past it to the junction with NY 300 (Union Avenue) at the center of the hamlet of Gardnertown. The strip continues another half-mile to the Powder Mill Road where the route runs along the southern side of Algonquin Powder Mill Park, where it becomes residential again. In the wetlands north of the route past the park, as the route bends around another hill to the south, Bushfield Creek flows into Quassaick Creek, which itself flows under NY 52 just above the now-drained Winona Lake south of the road. Here the route turns more to the south.\nJust after the junction with Fifth Avenue, a thousand feet past the lake, the route crosses over Interstate 84 at that route's exit 37. Just after the overpass, NY 52 turns eastward down the onramp and merges with the interstate. The four-lane expressway is the only section of NY 52 not to be a two-lane surface road, and is its last and longest concurrency. The two routes follow the northern border of the city of Newburgh northeast and then east. At Exit 39, a mile and a half (2.4 km) from the merger, US 9W (Albany Post Road north of the exit, North Robinson Avenue south of it) and NY 32 intersect just south of the end of their overlap. NY 32 follows North Plank Road as it turns inland towards New Paltz, while US 9W continues to parallel the river north to Marlboro and Highland.\n\nAfter exit 39, NY 52 and I-84 continue east between the city of Newburgh on the south and the town's affluent residential hamlet of Balmville to the north. The expressway widens to six lanes as it reaches the twin spans of the 1.5-mile (2.4 km) Hamilton Fish Newburgh-Beacon Bridge. Just before crossing over the Hudson River, the routes cross over the CSX West Shore Railroad.\nIn the middle of the wide crossing of the river's Newburgh Bay, the routes enter Dutchess County. To the south the cities of Beacon and Newburgh frame a view of the northern Hudson Highlands, including Beacon Mountain, Breakneck Ridge and Storm King. To the north marinas at Chelsea and New Hamburg are visible on the river's east side, with the Roseton and Danskammer power plants standing out on the west.\n\nDutchess County\nOn the east side of the Hudson, NY 52 and I-84 cross over Metro-North Railroad's Hudson Line just north of the Beacon station, visible from the bridge. They pass briefly through the northern corner of the city of Beacon, where the bridge's tolls ($1.50 for cars paying cash, $1.25 for EZPass users, and more for trucks) is collected from eastbound traffic. Immediately afterwards is the town of Fishkill and Exit 41. NY 9D crosses, taking traffic north towards Wappingers Falls and south into Beacon. NY 52 Business begins here along the latter direction.\nAfter the exit, the routes narrow to four lanes again and bend northeast, passing Dutchess Stadium on the north. Prominent on a hilltop south of the road is Fishkill Correctional Facility. As the expressway bends eastward again, high chain-link fences with concertina wire surround the concrete buildings of another prison, Downstate Correctional Facility, on the north. Signs warn drivers not to stop due to the proximity of both facilities.\nA mile and a half (2.4 km) further east, after passing through a rock cut and going over undulating terrain in a woody area, the routes turn southeast into Exit 44. Here NY 52 Business completes its loop from the south, and NY 52 leaves the interstate after 8 miles (13 km). It closely parallels I-84 for the remainder of its route.\n\nNY 52 passes through a residential area as a two-lane surface road as it heads northeast from I-84. A quarter-mile (400 m) from the interchange, it enters the village of Fishkill, the last along its route. As Main Street, it soon becomes heavily developed, with businesses on both sides. Jackson Street, which soon becomes CR 34, leaves to the north midway through the village. Downtown culminates in the intersection with US 9, a divided four-lane commercial strip at this point.\nOn the other side of US 9, NY 52 becomes Hopewell Avenue. It passes through some residential and less intensely commercial areas before leaving the village after a quarter-mile, still following a northeast heading. The next mile closely parallels both Fishkill Creek and Metro-North's infrequently used Beacon Line. At the small hamlet of Brinckerhoff, the route bends southeast to cross them both as NY 82 continues northeast towards Hopewell Junction.\nThree-quarters of a mile (1.1 km) later, after bending around Honess Mountain, NY 52 crosses the East Fishkill town line at the hamlet of Wiccopee. It curves northeast again and soon passes the large IBM manufacturing facilities and the Hudson Valley Research Park on the south. CR 31 (Palen Road) leaves from the north in the middle of this mile-long stretch.\nJust after the park, CR 27 (Lime Kiln Road), a divided four-lane surface road, leaves to the south, connecting to I-84 at Exit 50. NY 52 turns more to the northeast for a half-mile, then bends slightly southeast past a swampy area that precedes the center of East Fishkill. Just before the small Gayhead Pond north of the route, NY 376 leaves, ultimately turning west towards Poughkeepsie. From that intersection the route continues east, then turns northeast after a half-mile. After another half-mile, NY 52 crosses under the Taconic State Parkway, its last junction with a limited-access route. Both entrance ramps to the parkway are on the south side of the route.\nA quarter-mile (400 m) from the parkway, CR 29 (Carpenter Road) forks off to the north. Over the mile (1.6 km) after the interchange, the route slowly curves back eastward through an area of residential side streets. Then NY 216 forks off to the northeast, leading to Green Haven Correctional Facility and the hamlet of Stormville.\n\nFor the next half-mile (800 m) NY 52 passes through a more wooded area, then turns southeastward again. After another half-mile, the route turns due south and begins to climb steeply into the wooded foothills of the Taconic Mountains through a narrow creek valley. I-84 crosses overhead, on a very high overpass. A half-mile further on from that, the Appalachian Trail (AT) crosses the route.\nThe route turns again a quarter-mile (400 m) from the AT to follow a more easterly course. The terrain levels out into a minimally developed area of small bumps and wetlands. After another three-quarters of a mile, NY 52 reaches its highest elevation east of the Hudson, 962 feet (293 m) above sea level, at the Mountain Top Road intersection.\nNY 52 turns southeast again and reaches the hamlet of Pecksville after a mile (1.6 km). There it has a staggered junction with CR 30 (Milltown Road on the south, then Holmes Road on the north). The route draws closer to I-84 and turns southeast. Three-quarters of a mile (1.1 km) from Pecksville, with Mill Pond between it and the interstate, NY 52 crosses the Putnam County line.\n\nPutnam County\nImmediately after crossing the county line, NY 52 enters the hamlet of Ludingtonville, part of the town of Kent. It consists of a few houses and some businesses, primarily gas stations that serve traffic from I-84's adjacent exit 58 for CR 40 (Ludingtonville Road). At that junction, the route is headed due south. It turns southwest briefly, then southeast again.\n\nThe next 2.5 miles (4.0 km) run almost straight through wooded, hilly country, getting further east of the interstate. Eventually NY 52 reaches the west shore of a small northern bay of Lake Carmel, center of the residential community of that name. Shortly afterward NY 311 branches off to the east on a short causeway across the lake. It is a mile (1.6 km) back to I-84's exit 61 via NY 311, the last connection between the interstate and NY 52 although their routes still run parallel.\nNY 52 continues along the western shore of the lake for another mile. Just past its south end, it intersects with CR 45 (Towners Road). After turning southwest the route intersects CR 48 (Horse Pound Road). A thousand feet (300 m) south of that junction, NY 52 reaches the town of Carmel.\n\nThe route bends southward again, passing Raymond Hill Cemetery, then a large strip mall on the westbound direction. NY 52 follows Gleneida Avenue, the main street of the hamlet of Carmel, the county seat, with businesses on both sides. A mile from the town line, just across from the old county courthouse, NY 301 ends its journey from Cold Spring. Just past the junction is Lake Gleneida, part of the New York City water supply system, the center of a park on that side of the route. A quarter-mile further on, at Reed Memorial Library, NY 52 ends at a three-way junction with US 6.\n\nHistory\nSimilar to many state highways in the region, NY 52 follows a number of roads originally built as private turnpikes during the early 19th century. While the turnpikes made significant improvements to very poor roads, they were not popular with the public and eventually failed, leaving their roads for the county or state to maintain.\n\nPredecessor turnpikes\nOne of these, the Woodbourne and Ellenville Turnpike Company, connected those two communities. After being incorporated by the New York Legislature in 1830, it built and opened a turnpike from Ellenville on the Delaware and Hudson Canal west to Woodbourne in 1838, and later extended it further in that direction to Liberty.\nTo the east of Ellenville, the Newburgh and Ellenville Plank Road Company was proposed in late 1849 to build and charge tolls on a plank road between Ellenville and Newburgh, major markets on the canal and Hudson respectively, and incorporated the following year. The company decided shortly thereafter to build on a southern route; the supporters of a northern route organized the Newburgh and Shawangunk Plank Road two weeks later. Both roads were completed in December 1851; an opening celebration for the Newburgh and Ellenville was held at Ellenville that month.\nThe south route is now, with some modifications, part of NY 52. In 1895 the Walden and Orange Lake Railroad, later part of the Orange County Traction Company, built a trolley line along the old turnpike between Orange Lake, then the end of a suburban line from Newburgh, and Walden. It carried passengers and freight, including milk, until its demise in 1925.\nOther former turnpikes used by NY 52 include short lengths of the Jeffersonville and Monticello Turnpike (Jeffersonville to Briscoe Road), Ulster and Orange Branch Turnpike (Liberty to Cross Farm Road), Philipstown Turnpike (Pecksville to Ludingtonville), and Putnam and Dutchess Turnpike (Ludingtonville to the end in Carmel). By the 1890s, the entire route that would become NY 52 existed as public or turnpike roads.\n\nPublic ownership\nAfter the demise of the turnpikes, the State Commission of Highways was created by the legislature in 1898 to improve and maintain state highways. In 1909, a connected network of routes was laid out by the legislature; none of the present NY 52 was included. It was also not part of the system of signed state routes numbered in 1924. By 1926, Route 39 was signed from Poughkeepsie to Patterson, using a short piece of modern NY 52 between East Fishkill and Stormville.\n\nFormal designation\nNY 52 was designated as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. West of East Fishkill, NY 52 was assigned to its current routing along a previously unnumbered road through downstate New York to the Pennsylvania state line; however, it was several years before NY 52 as a whole was improved and paved. At its west end, NY 52 connected with US 106, which had been designated in 1926 and ended at the Delaware River on the Pennsylvania state line. US 106 was never extended into New York, and is now PA 652 near the border.\nTo the east of East Fishkill, the newly designated NY 52 used the old alignment of 1920s Route 39 from East Fishkill to West Patterson, where 52 continued along previously unnumbered roads south to Carmel, then east to NY 22 at Sears Corners (northeast of Brewster) over modern NY 311, US 6, and NY 312, as well as its modern alignment from Lake Carmel to Carmel. At the time, modern NY 52 from Stormville to Ludingtonville (northwest of Lake Carmel) was designated as part of NY 216. NY 52 and NY 216 mostly swapped alignments in the area c. 1937; NY 52 was rerouted onto its modern alignment between Stormville and Lake Carmel, utilizing the portion of NY 216 from Stormville and Ludingtonville as well as a new roadway between Ludingtonville and Lake Carmel while NY 216 was relocated to the old Route 39 alignment (Stormville–Poughquag–West Patterson). The original NY 52 segment from West Patterson to Lake Carmel was assigned as an extension of NY 311. NY 52 was also truncated to its present terminus in Carmel at this time.\n\nRealignments and detours\nThe only major change to NY 52's routing since then came with the opening of the Newburgh–Beacon Bridge in 1963. Prior to then, NY 52 had crossed the Hudson River on the Newburgh–Beacon Ferry, approaching from the west on Dupont Avenue and Broadway (overlapping NY 17K on Broadway) and from the east on Fishkill Avenue and Wolcott Avenue (now mostly NY 52 Business).\nNatural disasters and construction have forced temporary closures and re-routings in some areas. At the end of 2002, a rockslide along the stretch climbing the Shawangunks east of Ellenville buried an 85-foot (25 m) section of the road with an estimated 1,000 cubic yards (800 m3) of rock and dirt. The state Department of Transportation closed the road temporarily. Automobile traffic was detoured via several local roads; trucks had to make a lengthy side trip via Route 17 During the 2003–2005 construction of the new bridge over the Wallkill River in Walden, NY 52 was routed to Walden's other bridge (the \"Low Bridge\") via Oak Street, which intersects the highway twice within the village. This required the erection of two temporary traffic signals, causing some new traffic problems in the village. Truck traffic was detoured to NY 17K via Albany Post Road and Stone Castle Road.\n\nFuture\nThe village of Walden has noted, in its 2019 Comprehensive Plan, the difficulties created by the oblique intersection at the eastern end of the Route 208 concurrency. Traffic on northbound 208 comes to a stop sign at the intersection, where 52 comes in from the right at a slightly lower grade and a sharp angle, with the view mostly blocked by a building.\nIt is also just opposite one of two curb cuts for a busy gas station. At rush hour, the traffic light at the nearby northern end often backs cars up along 52 for some distance, making the turn into the gas station difficult, especially when vehicles on 52 make the left turn into the curb cut. Some are often stranded in the middle of the intersection when turning between the two highways. A 2009 traffic study found the intersection at level of service D, during peak hours with the potential to reach \"F\" within five years.\nThe layout of the intersection is very poor for trucks making this turn; they have caused damage to the curb. The congestion that all these factors create has been forcing more drivers to resort to the use of side streets, the village believes, since traffic counts have been going up on 52 and 208 but down on the concurrency. It has prohibited all trucks over 5 short tons (4.5 t) from any road in the village except the two state highways and certain side streets, and continues to monitor the situation with the hope of eventually signalizing the junction.\n\nMajor intersections\nNew York State Route 52A\nNew York State Route 52A is a 2.78-mile (4.47 km) alternate route of NY 52 in western Sullivan County. The route begins at NY 17B near the hamlet of Fosterdale and continues north and east to its terminus at NY 52 near the north end of Kenoza Lake. It serves mainly to shorten the trip from Callicoon to Liberty via NY 52. The route was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York.\nThe entire route is in Delaware, Sullivan County.\n\nNew York State Route 52 Business\nNew York State Route 52 Business (abbreviated NY 52 Bus.) is a business route of NY 52 that extends for 4.74 miles (7.63 km) through the city of Beacon in Dutchess County. The route is signed as east–west, starting at I-84 / NY 52 exit 41 and NY 9D north of Beacon and ending at I-84 / NY 52 exit 44 southwest of the village of Fishkill, where NY 52 leaves I-84, ending the I-84 / NY 52 concurrency. NY 52 Business is not posted on guide signs on I-84.\nNY 52 Business begins at I-84 / NY 52 exit 11 and runs concurrent with NY 9D into Beacon. At Main Street, NY 52 Business leaves NY 9D and follows Main Street east through the Lower Main Street Historic District and across town to Fishkill Avenue. The route turns left onto that street, following Fishkill Avenue out of the city. At Prospect Street, a local road straddling the Beacon city line, NY 52 Business becomes state-maintained as NY 980J, an unsigned reference route.\nAfter Millholland Drive, Fishkill Avenue becomes Fishkill's Main Street before meeting I-84 / NY 52. At the interchange, NY 52 Business, as well as the NY 980J designation, comes to an end while NY 52 continues east along Main Street.The entire route is in Dutchess County.\n\nSee also\nU.S. Roads portal\n New York (state) portal\nList of state routes in New York\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nNew York State Route 52 at Alps' Roads •  New York Routes",

    "text": "Traces of Death is a 1993 American mondo film that consists of various scenes of stock footage depicting death and real scenes of violence.\n\nSummary\nUnlike the earlier Faces of Death which usually included fake deaths and reenactments, Traces consists mostly of actual footage depicting death and injury, and consists also of archival footage from other films. It was written and narrated by Damon Fox.\n\nProduction\nIn the first two films of the series, Damon Fox was the narrator. Darrin Ramage, who would later become the founder of Brain Damage Films, would become the host for the third, fourth and fifth volumes. Unlike Faces of Death, the footage throughout the entire films are real and are not staged or reenacted. Starting with Traces of Death II, scenes were accompanied by background music from death metal and grindcore bands.\nIn Traces of Death, some notable scenes are included in the film, the murder of Maritza Martin, the Iranian Embassy siege in London, the suicide of Pennsylvania treasurer R. Budd Dwyer, and the archive footage of the evidence of Ilse Koch.\n\nSoundtrack\nThe soundtrack for the Traces of Death, were tracks by J. R. Bookwalter from the 1989 film Robot Ninja. Later in Traces of Death III, the first soundtrack album was released on CD.\n\nTraces of Death III soundtrack\nThe soundtrack for Traces Of Death III was released on CD by Relapse Records in 1995. The music featured in the film include:\n\n\"Regina Confessorum\" by Dead World\n\"Orgy of Self-Mutilation\" by Dead World\n\"Brainpan Blues\" by Pungent Stench\n\"Revenge\" by Core\n\"Traces of Death\" by Mortician\n\"Frozen in Time\" by Kataklysm\n\"Slaughtered\" by Hypocrisy\n\"Stained\" by Purge\n\"Sadistic Intent\" by Sinister\n\"Violent Generation\" by Brutality\n\"Skin Her Alive\" by Dismember\n\"Into the Bizarre\" by Deceased\n\"Low\" by Gorefest\n\"Vanished\" by Meshuggah\n\"Open Season\" by Exit-13\n\"Nightstalker\" by Macabre\n\"Blood Everywhere\" by Dead World\n\"Down on Whores\" by Benediction\n\"God Is a Lie\" by Hypocrisy\n\"Bodily Dismemberment\" by Repulsion\n\"Darkened Soul\" by Core\n\"I Lead You Towards Glorious Times\" by Merzbow\n\nControversy\nThe original Traces of Death has run into controversy worldwide due to its graphic content.\nIn 1997, Amy Hochberg, a woman living in Coaldale, Pennsylvania rented the film from a video store and was so disgusted by the film's content that she considered keeping the tape to prevent children from procuring it from the store. She also contacted multiple animal rights groups after witnessing a scene in the film wherein a pig is experimented on with a blowtorch. She also lodged a complaint with the video store she had rented it from, as she thought the film was simply \"911 calls with a little more\".\nIn June 2005, the British Board of Film Classification refused to give the first film an age certificate, effectively banning it. The BBFC considered the film to have \"no journalistic, educational or other justifying context for the images shown\", while also suggesting that the film could potentially breach UK law under the Obscene Publications Act.\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nKerekes, David; Slater, David (1995).

    "text": "Georg Donatus, Hereditary Grand Duke of Hesse (Georg Donatus Wilhelm Nikolaus Eduard Heinrich Karl, 8 November 1906 – 16 November 1937) was the first child of Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse, and his second wife, Princess Eleonore of Solms-Hohensolms-Lich. He was a nephew of Empress Alexandra and Emperor Nicholas II of Russia, as well as a great-grandson of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom.\n\nMarriage and children\nOn 2 February 1931, at Darmstadt, Georg Donatus, a great-grandson of Queen Victoria, married his first cousin once removed, Princess Cecilie of Greece and Denmark, daughter of Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark and Princess Alice of Battenberg, sister of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and great-great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The couple had four children:\n\nOn 1 May 1937 Georg Donatus and Princess Cecilie both joined the Nazi Party.\n\nDeath\nIn October 1937, Georg Donatus's father, Grand Duke Ernest Louis of Hesse, died. \nA few weeks after the funeral, his younger brother, Prince Louis, was due to be married to the Hon. Margaret Geddes, daughter of Lord Geddes. On 16 November 1937, Georg Donatus, Cecilie, their two young sons, Georg's mother Grand Duchess Eleonore, the children's nurse, a family friend, a pilot, and two crewmen, took off in a Sabena Junkers Ju 52 aeroplane from Darmstadt, bound for the United Kingdom, where the marriage ceremony of Prince Louis would take place. The aeroplane hit a factory chimney near Ostend, in Belgium, and crashed, bursting into flames and killing everyone on board. Cecilie was in an advanced state of pregnancy with their fourth child at the time of the crash. The remains of the newborn baby were found in the wreckage, indicating that Cecilie had gone into labour during the flight. The inquiry by the Belgian authorities into the crash suggested that, because of the birth, the pilot was attempting to land at the Stene aerodrome in Ostend despite poor weather conditions.\n\nAftermath\nPrince Louis's wedding had been scheduled for the 20th but, following discussions with his future father-in-law Lord Geddes, was brought forward to the day following the accident (17 November), as a small and quiet ceremony with the guests dressed in mourning.\nImmediately afterwards, he set off with his new wife Margaret to Belgium to visit the crash site. The funeral and burial of Georg Donatus and his family took place at the Rosenhöhe, Darmstadt, Hesse, a few days later. Attending were Prince Philip, Prince Christoph of Hesse, Gottfried, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, Prince Philipp of Hesse, Berthold, Margrave of Baden, Prince August Wilhelm of Prussia and Lord Louis Mountbatten, among others. A photograph of the funeral procession, showing Prince Louis as chief mourner, shows crowds saluting the mourners with the Hitler salute. World War II began less than two years later.\nThe Hereditary Grand Duke and Duchess's fourteen-month-old daughter, Johanna, was the only one of the family who was not on board the aircraft. She was adopted by her uncle Prince Louis and aunt Princess Margaret in early 1938. Johanna died of meningitis in 1939.\nWith the death of the childless Prince Louis in 1968, the male line of the Hesse and by Rhine became extinct.\n\nTitles\n8 November 1906 – 16 November 1937: His Royal Highness The Hereditary Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine\nGeorg Donatus never acceded to the grand ducal throne as it had been abolished at the end of the First World War.

Williams attended Smithson Valley High School, after which he started his collegiate career with the Wyoming Cowboys before transferring to play for the Utah State Aggies.\n\nHigh school career\nWilliams attended Smithson Valley High School in Comal County, Texas. In his senior season, Williams threw for 32 touchdowns with 3,239 yards and had 1,230 rushing yards with 16 rushing touchdowns. Williams was a consensus 3-star recruit and according to 247Sports.com he was the 40th best pro style quarterback in the class of 2019. Williams was originally committed to Houston but he decided to play college football at the University of Wyoming over Baylor, Oklahoma State, and TCU.\n\nCollege career\nWyoming\nWilliams played sparingly in his freshman season. He would make his first career start in the Arizona Bowl where he would throw for three touchdowns and he would also have a rushing touchdown in a 38–17 win against Georgia State. In the next season, Williams played in all six games in a shortened season rushing for 6 touchdowns while only having one passing touchdown with three interceptions. Williams would play in eight games the following season. After a three-game losing streak Williams was named the starting quarterback against San Jose State. Wyoming lost 21–27 behind two touchdowns and two interceptions from Williams. He finished the season with 8 passing touchdowns with 5 interceptions and one rushing touchdown. In the Famous Idaho Potato Bowl against Kent State, Williams threw for one touchdown with 127 yards, and he rushed for 200 yards and 4 touchdowns in the 52–38 win.

She is best known as a semi-finalist on the 9th season of The Voice, where she chose Pharrell Williams as her coach and was later \"stolen\" by Adam Levine. She had previously released two EPs prior to appearing on The Voice.\n\nBiography\nAmy Lynn Vachal was born on December 8, 1988 to an American father, Richard Vachal, and a Filipina mother, Deirdra Vachal, who is a daughter of Filipino politician, former congressman, and Governor of Cebu, Pablo P. Garcia and Judge Esperanza Fiel-Garcia. She has one older brother, Jake Vachal. Growing up, Vachal's love for singing developed into a \"secret passion\". She graduated from the Rutgers Preparatory School before she pursued a dual degree in economics and studio art at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania and played both varsity soccer and lacrosse.\nAfter a traumatic head injury from playing lacrosse, Vachal turned to music as she recovered. She started writing songs and performed her first set in New York City at the age of 20 at Arlene's Grocery on the Lower East Side. After finishing college, she sold a few of her paintings to move to New York and started performing in small clubs and cafes such as Rockwood Music Hall, The Living Room, and Caffe Vivaldi. While living in New York, she had several jobs as a voice-over artist, waitress, secretary, barista, and also worked in a bakery and a bar.\n\nCareer\nEarly career\nVachal's first EP, Appleseed, was released in 2011. She also released a single in 2013, \"Catapult\". After she was awarded positions in artist-in-residency programs at The Motley Fool in Alexandria, VA and Madrono Ranch in Medina, Texas as a songwriter, she returned to New York City and recorded her second EP entitled Crinkle Bloom, released in 2014, with Ken Rockwood of Rockwood Recordings. Her second EP's songs were written during her first two years in New York. She had also written one song in Medina. She took on more voice-over work for commercial demos, eventually landing a national campaign as the singer for a Kellogg's commercial in 2014.\n\n2015: The Voice\nVachal auditioned for the ninth season of The Voice, singing \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\" for her blind audition. Except for Adam Levine whose team was full, the three other coaches, Gwen Stefani, Pharrell Williams, and Blake Shelton, turned their chairs for her, and she eventually chose Williams as her coach. She advanced to the Knockout rounds, where she was not chosen to advance by Williams. However, Levine and Shelton then opted to steal her, with Vachal choosing Levine as her new coach. Vachal's performances charted consistently, including her version of Drake's Hotline Bling charting at No. 28 on Billboard's Digital Songs chart. A week later, her rendition of Taylor Swift's Blank Space charted at No. 24. She was eliminated in the semi-finals.\n\nChart of The Voice performances\nStudio version of performance reached the top 10 on iTunes\n\nCareer after The Voice\nAfter her elimination from The Voice, Vachal stated that she would be working on her first full-length album soon. She resides in Brooklyn, New York when not on tour as she workshops new material for a prospective release. On March 3, 2017, she released the single \"Wait\" and on March 28, she appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in the segment 'Battle of the Instant Songwriters'.\n\nDiscography\nSingles\nReferences\nExternal links\nAmy Vachal on Twitter",

    "title": "Ganymede Abducted by the Eagle",
    "text": "Ganymede Abducted by the Eagle (c. 1531–1532) is a painting by the Italian late Renaissance artist Antonio da Correggio. It is housed in the Kunsthistorisches Museum,  Vienna, Austria.\nThe work was part of a series executed by Correggio for Federico II Gonzaga in Mantua, about the loves of Jupiter. The painting depicts Ganymede.\n\nHistory\nThe series of Jupiter's Loves was conceived after the success of Venus and Cupid with a Satyr. Correggio painted four canvasses in total, although others had been programmed perhaps.\nIn the first edition of his Lives, late Renaissance art biographer Giorgio Vasari mentions only two of the paintings, Leda (today at the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin) and one Venus (presumably the Danae currently  in the Borghese Gallery of Rome), although he knew them only from descriptions provided by Giulio Romano. Vasari mentions that the commissioner, Duke Federico II Gonzaga, wanted to donate the works to emperor and King of Spain Charles V: the fact that the other two works, the Ganymede and Jupiter and Io, were in Spain during the 16th century implies that they were part of the same series. British art historian Cecil Gould suggested that Federico had commissioned the Io and Ganymede for himself, and that they were ceded to Charles V only after the duke's death in 1540, perhaps on occasion of the marriage of the king's son, Philip; others hypothesized that Federico ordered them for the Ovid room in his Palazzo Te.\nIn 1603–1604 the painting was acquired by the emperor Rudolf II together with Parmigianino's Cupid Making His Arch, and sent to Prague. The canvas was in Vienna since as early as the 1610s, when it is talked in the Habsburg imperial collections together with Io.\n\nReferences\nSources\nAdani, Giuseppe (2007).

    "text": "Olearia lanuginosa is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae and is endemic to southern Australia. It is an erect shrub with egg-shaped leaves and white to mauve and yellowish, daisy-like inflorescences.\n\nDescription\nOlearia lanuginosa is an erect, twiggy shrub that typically grows to a height of up to 1 m (3 ft 3 in) and has cottony-hairy branchlets. Its leaves are arranged alternately along the branchlets, egg-shaped, 0.5–2 mm (0.020–0.079 in) long, 0.5–1.3 mm (0.020–0.051 in) wide, sessile and cottony-hairy. The heads or daisy-like \"flowers\" are arranged singly on the ends of short side-branchlets and are 7–12 mm (0.28–0.47 in) in diameter and sessile. Each head has four to seven white to mauve ray florets, the ligule 3–5 mm (0.12–0.20 in) long, surrounding five to ten mauve to yellowish disc florets. Flowering occurs from November to March and the fruit is a hairy achene, the pappus with whitish bristles about 2.5 mm (0.098 in) long.\n\nTaxonomy\nWoolly olearia was first formally described in 1956 by James Hamlyn Willis who gave it the name Olearia floribunda var. lanuginosa in the journal Muelleria, based on material collected by Joseph Maiden near Murray Bridge in 1907. In the same year, Norman Arthur Wakefield raised the variety to species status as Olearia lanuginosa in The Victorian Naturalist. The specific epithet (lanuginosa) means \"abounding in wool\".\n\nDistribution and habitat\nOlearia lanuginosa grows in heath, mallee and woodlands in the Coolgardie, Great Victoria Desert, Mallee and Murchison bioregions of Western Australia, in the south-east of South Australia and in the Big and Little Deserts and Grampians regions of Victoria.\n\nConservation status\nWoolly daisy bush is listed as \"not threatened\" by the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "Enantiophanes",
    "text": "Enantiophanes was a Byzantine jurist whose exact identity is uncertain. The period when the jurist lived who bears this name has also been a subject of much dispute among scholars.\n\nIdentity\nJohn Thomas Graves, writing in 1870, states the following:\nCujacius, in his Preface to the 60th book of the Basilica, prefixed to the 7th volume of Fabrot's edition of that work, supposes Enantiophanes to be the assumed name of a Graeco-Roman jurist, who wrote peri enantiophanôn, or concerning the explanation of apparent legal inconsistencies. Suarez (Notit. Basil. § 35) says that Photius, in his Nomocanon, mentions having written such a work. Fabricius, in a note upon the work of Suarez (which is inserted in the Bibliotheca Graeca,) states that Balsamo, in his Preface to the Nomocanon of Photius, refers to Enantiophanes. Assemanni, however, shows (Bibl. Jur. Orient. ii. 18, p. 389) that there is no reason for attributing a work peri enantiophanôn to Photius, that there is no passage in his Nomocanon relating to such a work, and that the sentence in which Balsamo is supposed by Fabricius to refer to Enantiophanes has no such meaning. The Ennantiophanôn biblion is cited in Basil. v. p. 726. Enantiophanes (Basil. vi. p. 250) cites his own book de Legatis et Mortis Causa Donationibus, and the Paragraphê, or annotation, of Enantiophanes is cited in Basil. vii. p. 496.\n\nPeriod\nAs to Enantiophanes's lifetime, Graves relates what follows:\nReiz (ad Theophilum, pp. 1234, 1236) thinks that Enantiophanes wrote before the composition of the Basilica, and marks his name with an asterisk as an ascertained contemporary of Justinian. In Basil. iii. p. 318 Enantiophanes calls Stephanus his master; but this is by no means conclusive. Assemanni, misled by Papadopoli, thinks that the Stephanus here meant lived under Alexius Comnenus, and was not the Stephanus who was one of the compilers of Justinian's Digest. The contemporary of Justinian, however, was undoubtedly the person intended; but Stephanus was one of those early Graeco-Roman jurists who, like Domninus, Patricius, and Cyrillus, are thought by Zachariae (Anecdota, p. viii.) to have been called by subsequent jurists masters or teachers in a general sense. (Compare Basil. 11. tit. i. s. 67, sch. ed. Heimbach, i. p. 646.) Zachariae places Enantiophanes among the jurists who lived before the time of Basileius Macedo (Hist. Jur. Gr. Rom. Deiius, § 20. 1, 2.) That he lived before the formation of the present text of the Basilica, appears from his being several times named in the text itself, as in iii. p. 258, where he cites Theophilus; ii. p. 560, where he cites the Code of Justinian; i. 99, where he cites the Novells of Justinian. According to the Scholium on the Basilica (ii. p. 548, ed. Heimbach), he seems to have written notes upon the Digest. That he was alive after the death of Justinian appears from Basil. iii. p. 230 (ed. Heimbach), where he cites a Novell of Justin. On the other hand, Assemanni thinks that he wrote after the composition of the Basilica, which, in the Scholium, Basil. i. p. 262, he appears to cite; but it is very likely that here, as in many other places, that which was originally a citation from the Digest has been subsequently changed for convenience into a reference to the Basilica. In Basil. iii. p. 440, he cites Gregorius Doxapater, whom Pohl (followed by Zachariae), on the supposed authority of Montfaucon, places in the first half of the 12th century; but we have shown that there is no ground for identifying Gregorius Doxapater with the Doxapater mentioned by Montfaucon. An eminent jurist of the time of Justinian is frequently cited in the Basilica, and in the Scholia on that work by the appellation of the Anonymous. This writer composed an Index or abridgment of the Novells of Justinian, and was the author of Paratitla (a comparison of parallel passages) in the Digest. To this work the treatise on apparently discordant passages would form a natural sequel; and Mortrenil (Histoire du Droil Byzantin, i. p. 296) makes it probable that Enantiophanes and the Anonymous were the same persons; for in Basil. vi. p. 251 Schol., a passage is ascribed to Enantiophanes, which, in Basil. vi. p. 260, Schol., is attributed to the Anonymous. Biener (Geschichte der Novellen Justinians, p. 56) threw out the conjecture, that the Anonymous was no other than Julianus, the author of the Latin Epitome of the Novells; and Zachariae (Anecdota, p. 204–7) attempts to establish this conjecture. Mortreuil seems disposed to identify the three. In order to facilitate investigation, we subjoin a list (formed from Reiz and Fabricius) of passages in the Basilica where the name of Enantiophanes occurs: Basil. i. pp. 70, 99, 100, 109, 260, 408, 262, 265, 266, ii. pp. 540, 560, 609, 610, 628, iii. pp. 43, 170, 258, 318, 393, 394, 412, v. p. 726, vi. 250, 251, 260, vii. 496, 499, 565, 640, 641.

    "title": "USS Wintle (DE-25)",
    "text": "USS Wintle (DE-25) was an Evarts-class destroyer escort constructed for the United States Navy during World War II.  The ship was promptly sent off into the Pacific Ocean to protect convoys and other ships from Japanese submarines and fighter aircraft. By the time she returned to the United States at the end of the war she had been awarded three battle stars.\n\nNamesake\nJack William Wintle was born on 18 April 1908 in Pittsburg, Kansas. He was appointed a midshipman at the United States Naval Academy on 14 June 1928 and graduated on 2 June 1932. He reported for duty on the USS California on 30 June 1932 and completed a three-year tour of duty before being transferred to submarine tender USS Bushnell for 17 months. On 7 August 1936, he reported to the Puget Sound Navy Yard to help supervise the fitting out of USS Perkins; and he remained in the destroyer after it went into commission on 18 September 1936. In the summer of 1939, he received postgraduate instruction at the Naval Academy before reporting for duty at the Philadelphia Navy Yard to help prepare USS Du Pont for recommissioning and service on the Neutrality Patrol. His tour of duty in that destroyer, one of the first in the Atlantic Squadrons to be fitted with sonar, ended in August 1940 when he was sent to New Orleans, Louisiana, where he served almost two years instructing NROTC midshipmen.\nLate in April 1942, he reported to the Bureau of Navigation in Washington where he learned that his next assignment was to be aide and flag lieutenant to the Commander, South Pacific Area and South Pacific Force. On 15 June 1942 he was promoted to lieutenant commander and, four days later, reported for duty in his new assignment in the South Pacific. He served under Rear Admiral Daniel J. Callaghan, Chief of Staff to the Commander South Pacific Area and South Pacific Force, through the early months of the Guadalcanal campaign in late 1942. Late in October 1942, when Callaghan went to sea as the commander of a cruiser-destroyer force, Wintle joined him on his flagship USS San Francisco as a member of his staff.\nOn the night of 12 and 13 November during the Battle of Savo Island, San Francisco suffered a terrific pounding from Imperial Japanese Navy ships, several Japanese salvos scored on its superstructure, obliterating her flag and navigating bridges. All but one member of the admiral's staff were killed, and Wintle was among the casualties. He was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross.\n\nConstruction and commissioning\nWintle was laid down on 1 October 1942 at the Mare Island Navy Yard as BDE-25, one of the destroyer escorts allocated to the Royal Navy under the lend-lease program; launched on 18 February 1943; sponsor unknown (Lt. Comdr. Wintle's widow sponsored DE-266 which ship carried the name Wintle at the time BDE-25 was launched); reallocated to the United States Navy on 4 June 1943; named Wintle on 14 June 1943 when DE-266 was allocated to the Royal Navy as her replacement; and commissioned on 10 July 1943.\n\nWorld War II Pacific Theater operations\nWintle completed shakedown training in late July and early August and returned to the Mare Island Navy Yard for post-shakedown repairs. On 21 September, she put to sea with a Hawaii-bound convoy and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 8 October. She departed Oahu, Hawaii, almost immediately to return home in the screen of another convoy on 17 October. On the 25th, the destroyer escort stood out of San Francisco Bay in the screen, built around Breton (CVE-23), for a convoy bound, via Pearl Harbor, to Viti Levu in the Fiji Islands. She delivered her charges at Nandi Harbor on 14 November and, after a three-day stopover, departed Viti Levu on 17 November to escort Neshanic (AO-71) to Funafuti in the Ellice Islands. She stopped there for two days before returning to sea on the 21st to escort Tallulah (AO-50) to a fueling rendezvous. When she returned to Funafuti the following day, \"Operation Galvanic\", the Gilbert Islands invasion, was well underway. All the destroyer escort's recent movements and those she made over the following fortnight were undertaken to support the warships participating in that campaign. On 8 December, Wintle completed her labors in behalf of \"Galvanic\" and set a course for Funafuti where she stopped between 9 and 12 December before continuing on toward Oahu in the screen for a convoy.\n\nWintle involved in collision\nThe warship arrived in Pearl Harbor on 21 December. After several days in port, she began battle practice training in the Hawaiian operating area. On 3 January 1944, Wintle and Dempsey (DE-26) came alongside one another to practice fueling at sea. After transferring about 1,000 gallons of fuel to Wintle, Dempsey prepared to leave. Suddenly, she rammed Wintle on her starboard side. Her anchor ripped open Wintle's starboard side from the lower platform deck to the main deck at frame 40. Dempsey's anchor also broke Wintle's degaussing coil and severed her return steam line. In her haste to change course, Dempsey swerved sharply, colliding with Wintle again, this time stern to stern, crushing Wintle's propeller guard against her hull. The damaged destroyer escort's repair party quickly stuffed mattresses into the breach in her hull and shored them up as best they could to prevent serious flooding. Wintle was able to make 10 knots without shipping too much water and reached Pearl Harbor the following morning to begin repairs. She completed repairs rapidly and returned to sea to resume exercises on 11 January.\n\nSupporting the invasion of the Marshall Islands\nTen days later, Wintle received orders assigning her to the 5th Amphibious Force for \"Operation Flintlock\", the invasion of the Marshall Islands. She departed Pearl Harbor that same day escorting four tank landing ships to Majuro. Wintle and her charges reached that atoll on 1 February to find that the American force had taken it without opposition the previous day. The destroyer escort led the patrol of the entrance of the lagoon on the 2nd, then met Caliente (AO-53) at sea, and escorted her into the lagoon on the 3rd. She then resumed anti-submarine warfare (ASW) patrol off Majuro and continued the task for the next six days. On the 9th and 10th, she escorted Sangay (AE-10) to Kwajalein, then headed back to Pearl Harbor, where she arrived on the 23rd. Wintle remained in the Hawaiian Islands until 2 March, when she got underway with Stadtfeld (DE-29) to escort a three-ship convoy to the Gilberts. They saw their charges safely to the Gilberts on 11 March and got underway the following day for the Solomons. Proceeding via Funafuti, the two destroyer escorts arrived off Lunga Point, Guadalcanal, on 18 March and reported for duty with the 3rd Fleet. For the next six months, Wintle crisscrossed the Southwest Pacific escorting tankers, transports, and cargo-men to and from various American bases, most frequently between the Solomons and the Admiralty Islands. When not engaged in escort missions, she honed her ASW skills during exercises with American submarines.\nOn 19 September, she arrived at Manus Island concluding her last Solomons-Admiralties run. On the 22d, she headed out of Seeadler Harbor for a new theater, the Palau Islands in the Central Pacific. The warship arrived in the anchorage at Kossol Passage three days later. Her stay proved brief because she set course back to Manus that same day. She reached Seeadler Harbor on 5 October and, after a brief availability alongside Piedmont (AD-17), headed back to the Palaus where she arrived on 15 October. During the following month, Wintle performed patrol and escort duties in the Palaus. On 10 November, she relieved Buchanan (DD-484) off Denges Passage and fired star shells over the passage and nearby Ngeregong Island in support of troops embarked in landing craft patrolling against the possibility of enemy reinforcements reaching Peleliu from Ngeregong. That duty lasted until 12 November when she left station to assist PC-1260, damaged in a collision with Kenmore (AK-221).\n\nOperating on the Saipan Patrol\nThe destroyer escort exited Kossol Passage on 18 November and steamed via Ulithi to the Marianas. She entered Apra Harbor, Guam, on the 28th and became a unit of the Saipan Patrol and Escort Force. For about 12 weeks, the warship patrolled the Marianas, primarily between Guam and Saipan. On Christmas night, she helped to repulse a Japanese air raid on U.S. Army Air Force installations ashore on Saipan. Two days later, she rescued three survivors from a B-29 bomber that crashed near Nafutan Point. After the excitement of late December, January 1945 was uneventful except for two round-trip voyages to Eniwetok and back.\nOn 5 February 1945, she received orders transferring her to the Marshalls-Gilberts Escort Force. She arrived at Eniwetok on 10 February and began duty escorting convoys from bases in the Marshalls and Gilberts to forward areas. She made frequent voyages between Guam, Kwajalein, and Eniwetok and cruised with a hunter-killer group in search of Japanese submarines reportedly operating in the Marshalls. On the night of 2 April, Wintle exchanged gunfire with Japanese shore batteries on bypassed Wotje Atoll after they opened fire on her while she hunted for a midget submarine. During American air strikes on enemy-held Mili, Jaluit, and Wotje in late April and early May, Wintle provided air-sea rescue services; but, fortunately, no aviator needed her assistance. On the night of 5 and 6 May, she covered the evacuation of natives from Japanese-held Jaluit Atoll. On 13 May, Wintle departed Eniwetok to screen two merchant ships on a voyage to the Palaus.\nWintle arrived in Kossol Passage on the 18th and, two days later, headed for Ulithi. There, she joined two ships damaged at Okinawa, Hazelwood (DD-531) and Rathburne (APD-25), and escorted them on the Ulithi-to-Eniwetok leg of their voyage home. The ships departed Ulithi on 25 May and made Eniwetok on the 29th. There, the destroyer escort resumed patrol and escort duties with the Marshalls-Gilberts Escort Force which she continued to perform until mid-June.\n\nAntisubmarine patrol operations\nOn 17 June, Wintle and Levy (DE-162) stood out of Eniwetok to take up ASW station on the shipping lanes between Eniwetok and the Marianas. The next day, she responded to a report that Endymion (ARL-9) had been torpedoed but, upon reaching the repair ship, found no submarine to attack. After an unsuccessful search, she headed back to Eniwetok. The warship continued intermittent patrols until 1 July when she put to sea from Eniwetok lagoon to rendezvous with a hunter-killer group built around Kassan Bay (CVE-69). She searched for Japanese submarines along the Eniwetok-Marianas shipping lanes until relieved by Snyder (DE-745) on 8 July. Wintle returned to Eniwetok where she took on fuel and supplies in preparation for the long voyage back to the United States. The destroyer escort exited the lagoon on 12 July, visited Pearl Harbor on the 18th and 19th, and entered San Francisco Bay on the 26th.\n\nPost-War activity\nThe ship unloaded ammunition at the Mare Island Navy Yard and entered Hunters Point, California, for repairs that same day. She was in drydock on 15 August when news of the Japanese capitulation arrived; and, on the 18th, most work ceased.\n\nPost-War deactivation\nFinally, on 15 November 1945, Wintle was placed out of commission and was berthed at Mare Island, California. On 28 November 1945, her name was struck from the Navy List. The former warship was sold for scrap to the Union Minerals & Alloys Corporation on 25 August 1947.\n\nAwards\nReferences\nThis article incorporates text from the public domain Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships.

    "text": "USS Dreadnaught (ID-1951), later YT-534 and YNG-21, was a United States Navy tug that was in service from 1918 to 1944.\n\nConstruction, acquisition and commissioning\nDreadnaught was built as a commercial tug of the same name by Union Iron Works at San Francisco, California, in 1917 for the Rolph Navigation and Coal Company of San Francisco. On 17 May 1917, the U.S. Navy purchased her for use during World War I and assigned her the naval registry identification number 1951. After fitting out at Mare Island Navy Yard at Vallejo, California, she was commissioned as USS Dreadnaught (ID-1951) on 31 January 1918.\n\nWorld War I service\nDeparting San Francisco on 27 February 1918 towing coal barges, Dreadnaught delivered the barges at Norfolk, Virginia, on 18 April 1918. She then proceeded to New London, Connecticut, where she arrived on 22 April 1918.\nDreadnaught was assigned to Patrol Force, United States Atlantic Fleet, and departed New London on 25 April 1918 to escort a convoy of submarine chasers to the Azores. On her return passage she aided in towing SS Luckenbach from the Azores to Bermuda and then towed the tug USS Goliah (SP-1494) from Bermuda to New York City, arriving there on 1 July 1918.\nBetween 6 September 1918 and 18 October 1918, Dreadnaught again escorted a group of submarine chasers from New London to the Azores and returned to New London. On 24 October 1918, she departed New London with a third convoy to the Azores, then proceeded to Brest, France, as escort for the United States Army tug Cuba. During the voyage, World War I\nended, on 11 November 1918. The two tugs arrived at Brest on 29 November 1918.\nDreadnaught should not be confused with the patrol vessel USS Dreadnought (SP-584), which also was in commission during World War I.\n\nPostwar European and Atlantic service\nDreadnaught operated on harbor duty at Brest and towed barges and ships between Brest, Lorient, and Bordeaux, France, until 20 March 1919, when she got underway to escort a convoy of submarine chasers to Lisbon, Portugal, and then on to Bermuda. She returned to Ponta Delgada in the Azores on 11 April 1919 for towing duty in the Azores until 29 July 1919. Towing submarine chasers, she returned to New York City on 19 August 1919. On 30 August 1919, she departed New York City for Norfolk, Virginia, with barges in tow, arriving at Norfolk on 1 September 1919. She then underwent an overhaul at Norfolk.\n\nService at San Francisco\nDreadnaught left Norfolk on 23 January 1920 bound for the Mare Island Navy Yard in Vallejo, California, where she arrived on 15 March 1920 and began another overhaul. When the U.S. Navy adopted its modern hull number system on 17 July 1920, Dreadnaught was classified as a \"harbor tug\" and redesignated YT-34. She was assigned to the 12th Naval District for duty in the San Francisco area.\nOn 14 March 1922, Dreadnaught was decommissioned, but she continued her 12th Naval District duties in the San Francisco area for many years after that in a non-commissioned \"in-service\" status.\nDreadnaught was reclassified as a \"gate tender (non-self propelled)\" - an anti-submarine barrier gate craft - and redesignated YNG-21 on 7 October 1940.\n\nDisposal\nIn September 1944, Dreadnaught was stricken from the Navy List. She reportedly was destroyed sometime thereafter.\n\nReferences\n This article incorporates text from the public domain Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships.

    "title": "Passphrase",
    "text": "A passphrase is a sequence of words or other text used to control access to a computer system, program or data. It is similar to a password in usage, but a passphrase is generally longer for added security. Passphrases are often used to control both access to, and the operation of, cryptographic programs and systems, especially those that derive an encryption key from a passphrase. The origin of the term is by analogy with password. The modern concept of passphrases is believed to have been invented by Sigmund N. Porter in 1982.\n\nSecurity\nSource:\nConsidering that the entropy of written English is less than 1.1 bits per character, passphrases can be relatively weak. NIST has estimated that the 23-character passphrase \"IamtheCapitanofthePina4\" contains a 45-bit strength. The equation employed here is:\n\n4 bits (1st character) + 14 bits (characters 2–8) + 18 bits (characters 9–20) + 3 bits (characters 21–23) + 6 bits (bonus for upper case, lower case, and alphanumeric) = 45 bits\n(This calculation does not take into account that this is a well-known quote from the operetta H.M.S. Pinafore. An MD5 hash of this passphrase can be cracked in 4 seconds using crackstation.net, indicating that the phrase is found in password cracking databases.)\nUsing this guideline, to achieve the 80-bit strength recommended for high security (non-military) by NIST, a passphrase would need to be 58 characters long, assuming a composition that includes uppercase and alphanumeric.\nThere is room for debate regarding the applicability of this equation, depending on the number of bits of entropy assigned. For example, the characters in five-letter words each contain 2.3 bits of entropy, which would mean only a 35-character passphrase is necessary to achieve 80 bit strength.\nIf the words or components of a passphrase may be found in a language dictionary—especially one available as electronic input to a software program—the passphrase is rendered more vulnerable to dictionary attack. This is a particular issue if the entire phrase can be found in a book of quotations or phrase compilations. However, the required effort (in time and cost) can be made impracticably high if there are enough words in the passphrase and if they are randomly chosen and ordered in the passphrase. The number of combinations which would have to be tested under sufficient conditions make a dictionary attack so difficult as to be infeasible. These are difficult conditions to meet, and selecting at least one word that cannot be found in any dictionary significantly increases passphrase strength.\nIf passphrases are chosen by humans, they are usually biased by the frequency of particular words in natural language. In the case of four word phrases, actual entropy rarely exceeds 30 bits. On the other hand, user-selected passwords tend to be much weaker than that, and encouraging users to use even 2-word passphrases may be able to raise entropy from below 10 bits to over 20 bits.\nFor example, the widely used cryptography standard OpenPGP requires that a user make up a passphrase that must be entered whenever decrypting or signing messages. Internet services like Hushmail provide free encrypted e-mail or file sharing services, but the security present depends almost entirely on the quality of the chosen passphrase.\n\nCompared to passwords\nPassphrases differ from passwords. A password is usually short—six to ten characters. Such passwords may be adequate for various applications if frequently changed, chosen using an appropriate policy, not found in dictionaries, sufficiently random, and/or if the system prevents online guessing, etc., such as:\n\nLogging onto computer systems\nNegotiating keys in an interactive setting such as using password-authenticated key agreement\nEnabling a smart-card or PIN for an ATM card where the password data (hopefully) cannot be extracted\nBut passwords are typically not safe to use as keys for standalone security systems such as encryption systems that expose data to enable offline password guessing by an attacker. Passphrases are theoretically stronger, and so should make a better choice in these cases. First, they usually are and always should be much longer—20 to 30 characters or more is typical—making some kinds of brute force attacks entirely impractical. Second, if well chosen, they will not be found in any phrase or quote dictionary, so such dictionary attacks will be almost impossible. Third, they can be structured to be more easily memorable than passwords without being written down, reducing the risk of hardcopy theft. However, if a passphrase is not protected appropriately by the authenticator and the clear-text passphrase is revealed its use is no better than other passwords. For this reason it is recommended that passphrases not be reused across different or unique sites and services.\nIn 2012, two Cambridge University researchers analyzed passphrases from the Amazon PayPhrase system and found that a significant percentage are easy to guess due to common cultural references such as movie names and sports teams, losing much of the potential of using long passwords.\nWhen used in cryptography, commonly the passphrase protects a long machine generated key, and the key protects the data. The key is so long a brute force attack directly on the data is impossible. A key derivation function is used, involving many thousands of iterations (salted & hashed), to slow down password cracking attacks.\n\nPassphrases selection\nTypical advice about choosing a passphrase includes suggestions that it should be:\n\nLong enough to be hard to guess\nNot a famous quotation from literature, holy books, et cetera\nHard to guess by intuition—even by someone who knows the user well\nEasy to remember and type accurately\nFor better security, any easily memorable encoding at the user's own level can be applied.\nNot reused between sites, applications and other different sources\n\nExample methods\nOne method to create a strong passphrase is to use dice to select words at random from a long list, a technique often referred to as diceware. While such a collection of words might appear to violate the \"not from any dictionary\" rule, the security is based entirely on the large number of possible ways to choose from the list of words and not from any secrecy about the words themselves. For example, if there are 7776 words in the list and six words are chosen randomly, then there are 7,7766 = 221,073,919,720,733,357,899,776 combinations, providing about 78 bits of entropy. (The number 7776 was chosen to allow words to be selected by throwing five dice. 7776 = 65)   Random word sequences may then be memorized using techniques such as the memory palace.\nAnother is to choose two phrases, turn one into an acronym, and include it in the second, making the final passphrase. For instance, using two English language typing exercises, we have the following. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog, becomes tqbfjotld. Including it in, Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country, might produce, Now is the time for all good tqbfjotld to come to the aid of their country as the passphrase.\nThere are several points to note here, all relating to why this example passphrase is not a good one.\n\nIt has appeared in public and so should be avoided by everyone.\nIt is long (which is a considerable virtue in theory) and requires a good typist as typing errors are much more likely for extended phrases.\nIndividuals and organizations serious about cracking computer security have compiled lists of passwords derived in this manner from the most common quotations, song lyrics, and so on.\nThe PGP Passphrase FAQ suggests a procedure that attempts a better balance between theoretical security and practicality than this example. All procedures for picking a passphrase involve a tradeoff between security and ease of use; security should be at least \"adequate\" while not \"too seriously\" annoying users. Both criteria should be evaluated to match particular situations.\nAnother supplementary approach to frustrating brute-force attacks is to derive the key from the passphrase using a deliberately slow hash function, such as PBKDF2 as described in RFC 2898.\n\nWindows support\nIf backward compatibility with Microsoft LAN Manager is not needed, in versions of Windows NT (including Windows 2000, Windows XP and later), a passphrase can be used as a substitute for a Windows password. If the passphrase is longer than 14 characters, this will also avoid the generation of a very weak LM hash.\n\nUnix support\nIn recent versions of Unix-like operating systems such as Linux, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Solaris and FreeBSD, up to 255-character passphrases can be used.\n\nSee also\nKeyfile\nPassword-based cryptography\nPassword psychology\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nDiceware page\nxkcd Password Strength common-viewed explanation of concept",

G. Delyagin announced live on air the results of the radio listeners' vote, which showed that they preferred presidential candidate P. Grudinin to the current president V. Putin.\nSince 2017 — columnist for the Tsargrad TV channel, hosts the section Position. Delyagin, in the second half of 2019 — Mobile Delyagin. Makes releases on political and economic issues on his YouTube channels Delyagin TV (account blocked for violating community rulesYouTube) и Real Delyagin ((51.4K subscribers, less than 2M views)).\nIn 1995, he was the first to use the word \"oligarch\" as a description of the leading politically influential figures of modern Russian business.\nn 2001, he published a then fantastic forecast that “in 2008, it is possible that a black man will be nominated for US President, who will collect a significant number of votes.”.\nIn 2003, during an election debate, Zhirinovsky told the Rodina candidate, former Airborne Forces commander General Shpak: \"I am glad that your son died in Chechnya,\" and repeated this phrase several times until his microphone was cut off. In response, Delyagin called Zhirinovsky an \"animal,\" after which he ordered his guards to beat him up, which led to a mass brawl.\nKey books: \"Beacons of Darkness: The Physiology of the Liberal Clan from Gaidar and Berezovsky to Sobchak and Navalny (2016)\", \"The Festive Hell of Freedom\" (the story of Romeo and Juliet, rewritten for a world where ordinary relations between the sexes are prohibited by law; a libretto for a ballet about a liberal dream, reviews and army poems), \"Beware, the Doors Are Opening. Volume 1. General Theory of Globalization\" and Volume 2. \"Special Theory of Globalization\" (2019).\nIn April 2020, M. G. Delyagin's personal website took 96th place in terms of citation in Runet social media according to the Brand Analytics analytical center, becoming one of three (except for the websites of Navalny and Sobyanin, who took the hundredth place) included in the rating of personal pages.\nAt the end of 2020, he put forward an initiative to support by all reasonable forces of Russia the \"Pact of Normality - a Step towards Transforming Russia\", which includes populist demands that, in his opinion, unite the absolute majority of Russians: the return of the retirement age of 55/60 years, a guarantee of a real subsistence minimum for citizens, progressive taxation of income and property, a compensatory tax based on the results of privatization, the direction of budget reserves to the development of Russia, confiscate property transferred to offshore zones as ownerless, limit corruption, arbitrariness of monopolies and financial speculation, provide cheap credit, withdraw from WTO agreements, cancel the Unified State Exam, stop the coronavirus madness, normalizeTemplate:Unknown term medicine and education, ban microfinance organizations, abolish juvenile justice and bring its organizers to justice, introduce a visa regime with social disaster zones, eliminate social dumping by obliging employers to provide migrant workers with conditions no worse than citizens of the Russian Federation, to finance their socialization and bear responsibility for the offenses they commit; to punish violators of these norms for the slave trade, to cancel the \"tax maneuver\" of 2018 (stimulating the export of raw materials from Russia and undermining its processing), to reduce VAT to 10%, to exempt investments from profit tax, to exempt productive small and micro businesses from all taxes, to double the responsibility of civil servants for offenses compared to ordinary citizens, to introduce the election of judges and senators, to govern on the basis of permanent electronic referendums with flexible delegation of votes\".\nHe was a candidate for deputy of the State Duma of the VIII convocation in the elections in September 2021 from the party \"A Just Russia - For Truth\" and won the elections.\nDeputy Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Economic Policy.\nDuring the Russian invasion of Ukraine in April 2022, as part of a group of deputies, he introduced a bill that would empower the Russian Prosecutor General and his deputies to invalidate media registrations and terminate television and radio broadcasting licenses if they spread “fakes” about the Russian military and their “discrediting,” calls for sanctions, as well as information that contains “clear disrespect for society, the state, and the Constitution of the Russian Federation.”.\n\nMain areas of scientific activity\nThe developer of the theory of globalization (in particular, he substantiated the key feature of globalization - the formation of collective consciousness as the main type of management of human activity in the 21st century; introduced the concepts of metatechnologies and high-hume - by analogy with high-tech; developed a theory of the development and formation of a global governing class), the author of the theory of the transition from the information society to the world of \"social platforms\", which, in his opinion, occurred in 2020.\nResearcher of the history of the formation and destruction of the British Empire, social mechanisms of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.\nResearcher of the complex influence of the main political, economic and social groups on the functioning of the state (since 1995).\nAuthor of the analysis of the specifics of Russian culture from the point of view of the global competitiveness of the Russian Federation.\nDeveloper of the first Banking Atlas of Russia (1995-1997).\n\nPolitical views and goals\nDelyagin's transition from liberalism to his current political views occurred in 1994 thanks to E. G. Yasin (\"Yevgeny Grigoryevich Yasin 'cured' me of liberalism\"), who, during the devaluation of the ruble, which led to the resignation of A. N. Shokhin and other members of the government and the strengthening of A. B. Chubais, resolutely convinced V. S. Chernomyrdin not to resort to extreme measures in carrying out reforms for several days. Delyagin, observing all these events, was deeply shocked by the system of values that dominated the new government environment and ceased to be a liberal. In addition, the First Chechen War served as a watershed: at its beginning, Delyagin was in the political team that opposed it.\nIn March 2008, Delyagin took part in the 6th Congress of the PCRM. A new party program was discussed and adopted at the congress. Delyagin admired the combination of liberalism and communism in the program and emphasized: \"Competitiveness requires a free person and requires justice. And freedom and justice are precisely that very communist liberalism that made me happy.\" In the summer of 2008, Delyagin spoke about the leader of the PCRM: \"Voronin is one of the few leaders in the post-Soviet space who evokes very strong and warm feelings. Extreme liberalism is completely unexpected for a communist... this is what the modern left should strive for. This is the closest to the ideal modern left.\" In 2009, Delyagin again praised the PCRM: \"The economic achievements of the PCRM are indisputable.\" Delyagin is a categorical opponent of a totally distributive planned economy (\"nonsense\"), but considers its strategic planning necessary; fully supports the idea of a \"compensatory tax\" on major privatization participants in order to overcome the \"split in Russian society between those who feel robbed and those who feel robbed\", emphasizing that the tax can be levied \"in kind, that is, in share packages\".\nOn December 10, 2011, Delyagin, together with A. Baranov, spoke at a protest rally on Bolotnaya Square, proclaiming \"the beginning of the Russian political spring\"; he demanded the abolition of Article 282 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.\nAfter the publication of V.V. Putin's articles in February 2012, he supported the ideas set out in them. Later, he systematically criticized the government for failing to implement Putin's May decrees, and Putin himself for condoning the \"sabotage\" of his decrees.\nIn June 2016, Mikhail Delyagin joined the left-center party \"A Just Russia\". He formulates his public goals as follows:\nto tell the leaders and politicians of Russia what is happening with our society and the world around it (and why the state should serve the people, not global speculators...) and what would be right to do for the success of our country.\nIn 2018, Delyagin proposed, as a response to the \"cold war of annihilation unleashed against Russia by the United States\", to close enterprises that are destroying the health of Russian citizens, or force them to switch to the production of safe products (including McDonald's catering and the production of highly carbonated drinks with excess sugar), and also to impose a 10% tax on transactions with the dollar, ensuring complete freedom of transactions with other currencies.\nHe is an expert at the Moscow Economic Forum.\n\nCriticism\nAfter Delyagin's appointment as Kasyanov's assistant to Prime Minister in 2002, Kommersant recalled his statement about President Vladimir Putin, made earlier on Chekist Day.: \"The problem is not even that we are ruled by Stalin, but that we are ruled by a very small Stalin who is not even able to strategize and decide where he wants to lead the country.\". The profile publication Financial Russia noted in 2002 the strange appointment of Delyagin as Kasyanov's as Last week it became known that economist Mikhail Delyagin has been appointed Mikhail Kasyanov's assistant. <...> The event seemed to be an ordinary one, but it caused a slight sensation among Delyagin's colleagues for two reasons. Firstly, everyone knows that Delyagin strongly disagreed with the economic course of Kasyanov's cabinet, and there are probably no accusations that Delyagin would not have had time to publicly express against the government[66]. Secondly, Delyagin's very persona as an assistant to the prime minister looks extremely odious — it feels like the economist has made it his profession to promote his own views on any issues. Over the past two months alone, Mikhail Delyagin has given 8 press conferences: on the euro, capital flight, Russia's modernization strategy, Bush's address to Congress, inflation in January, the Falcon case, Russia's accession to the WTO, and President Putin's reputation. Simply put, Delyagin slightly overfed the press. A somewhat ironic attitude began to arise among journalists towards Mr. Delyagin: an expert on any issues, ready to give any comments. But if the government says \"white,\" then Delyagin will definitely say \"black.\" Most importantly, it was unclear why, actually. The public and the press should be interested in the opinion of Mikhail Delyagin, who is, in fact, a private individual. <...> Prior to his appointment to the White House, Mikhail Delyagin called himself the \"public director of the Institute for Problems of Globalization,\" but no one had ever heard of any other researchers at this institute. Therefore, the press dubbed Delyagin a \"man-institute.\" Mikhail Delyagin's fame arose due to conscious, systematic and extremely intensive PR. And the government, of course, also noticed the efforts of the human institution. Which is probably what he wanted.Left-wing publicist Dmitry Yakushev wrote in 2005: \"Listening to Delyagin, I found out one important thing. Previously, I didn't quite understand how you could come up with outright nonsense about Putin's feudalism and expect people to take it seriously. Then it hit me. Delyagin came up with an ideological scheme justifying the anti-Putin alliance of the left with the big bourgeoisie, and he does not doubt for a second that the scheme is brilliant, since he is a great economist and everything he comes up with is brilliant by definition. Yakushev also noted in 2008 that Delyagin's views were anti-human: \"Following him, the progress of mankind will probably strive not to fight poverty and disease, but to the customs of Sparta. There, the problems of improving the gene pool were solved easily.\". Andrey Terentyev (Trudovaya Rossiya) calls Delyagin a \"prominent businessman of left-wing political business\": I wonder how Delyagin's \"curbing monopolies\" combines with the imperialist struggle for the redistribution of world markets? It's very simple. Delyagin is an educated businessman enough to seriously express the interests of the petty bourgeoisie. In fact, he breeds petty-bourgeois snot in the interests of preserving big capital and the capitalist mode of production as a whole.Vladimir Burdyugov, a member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the CPSU and editor of the Communist magazine in 2011, called Delyagin \"pink not by his looks, but by his complexion.\", He also accused them of being ready to \"... surrender Russia to the flower revolutions\" and \"... prepare a Libyan scenario for Russia.\".\nThe official website of the PKK-PKK in 2019 called Delyagin a \"hardened bourgeois politician\", and in 2013, he became a \"soldier of the bourgeois empire\".\nSince M. Delyagin, according to S. G. Kara-Murza, adheres to both left-centrist and \"orange\" views., this position provokes protest from both some supporters and opponents of the ideas of liberalism in Russia. Both tried to find in his publications signs of obvious sympathy for any political ideology in Russia. In 2005, in his book \"Exporting Revolution. Saakashvili, Yushchenko...\" S. G. Kara-Murza wrote: \"the position of the relatively new left-wing patriotic organization Rodina remains unclear,\" while he believed that \"a prominent representative of Rodina, M. Delyagin, holds a radical orange position.\".\nSome journalists and bloggers tried to accuse M. Delyagin of simultaneously sympathizing with both right-wing and left-wing political ideologies, and even with supporters of liberalism in Russia (for his participation in the protest movement in Russia in 2012).\n\nPavel Danilin, analyzing Delyagin's book \"Retribution on the Threshold. The Revolution in Russia: when, how, why\", comes to the conclusion:This is his weakest and most unsuccessful book, nevertheless, it is of interest to political scientists. Many of Delyagin's prophecies have not come true, and many things are happening according to a completely different scenario.\n...To seize power, our dear revolutionaries: \"it will be necessary to establish close and strong relations not only with the main (and traditionally hostile to each other) power structures, but also with the main (and also hostile to each other) groups existing within each of these structures.\" This is the finish line. Throughout the book, Delyagin talked about how the security forces are robbing the country, how they are tormenting Russia and how much trouble they are causing. And then he says that in order to win, revolutionaries must \"lie down\" under these security forces and surrender to them with a smile on their lips.\nThe online publication \"Politgexogen\" also wrote about this:\n\nDelyagin's frightening predictions, as a rule, never come true. <...> the scarier the forecast coming from Delyagin, the more he is quoted, and the more often the name \"Cassandra\" flashes in the press. Rather, he is a theorist who has been broadcasting annually for ten years about the \"inevitable crisis\", followed by the \"bloody chaos\" that will surely follow if… If, apparently, Delyagin is not installed back in power. <...> Staying in the ranks of the anti-oligarchic party, Delyagin scientifically predicted the \"catastrophic\" consequences of the trial of Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Big deal, party principlesThe online publication \"Politgexogen\" also wrote about this:In 2011, the famous economist Nikita Krichevsky accused Delyagin of plagiarizing his article. In 2012, when Delyagin, following the founder and head of the City Without Drugs Foundation, Yevgeny Roizman, publicly supported the criminal charges against opposition activist Taisiya Osipova, Alexander Averin, a member of the Other Russia party, accused Delyagin of lying and slander.: Later, Averin was also sentenced to a criminal termOn the eve of tomorrow's cassation, Taisiya Osipova was also uncovered by Delyagin. In the case of Taisiya Osipova, Mikhail Delyagin allowed himself to lie, slander and call for the death penalty of an innocent man. Delyagin is a man of legendary, epic cowardice. Michal Delyagin, a man with the face and figure of an eternally offended accountant and the psychology of a hyena (may this noble beast forgive comparisons with Delyagin), solemnly goes toIn 2020, the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation accused M. Delyagin of deliberately misleading Russian citizens about the alleged ban on the import of test systems for the diagnosis of coronavirus and the import of medical masks, as he said in an interview with IA Regnum.\nSaliya Vapieva of the National Liberation Movement (NOD) wrote: \"Delyagin is an enemy of the people, because he calls for voting against amendments to the Constitution, which should lead to the restoration of Russia's sovereignty.\"\nDenies the existence of the coronavirus pandemic, emphasizing that the epidemic threshold has been exceeded worldwide in only 1 country (San Marino). He is an opponent of compulsory vaccination.\nIn April 2022, Delyagin and a group of associates introduced Bill No. 113045-8 on the Control of the Activities of Persons under Foreign Influence, according to which a \"foreign agent\" is a Russian citizen who does not receive foreign funding, but who \"is under foreign influence in other forms.\" The bill was criticized because it \"expands the space for arbitrariness.\"; even the head of the Constitutional Committee of the Federation Council, Andrei Klishas, spoke out against \"frequent changes to the law.\".\nIn June 2022, Delyagin and a group of associates introduced Bill № 140449-8, sharply restricting the holding of rallies, marches, demonstrations and assemblies. Since the authors proposed to include \"religious premises, buildings and structures, as well as land plots on which such buildings and structures are located\" in the list of places near which it is prohibited to hold meetings, marches, rallies and demonstrations, the Russian Orthodox Church expressed concern about this bill: the amendments contradict the law \"On Freedom of Conscience and Religion.\" about religious associations». In addition, Delyagin's bill prohibits holding public actions near train stations and stations, as well as near buildings of public authorities.\n\nResponses to criticism Mikhail Delyagin in 2012 commented on the accusations of \"political omnivorousness\" and \"love for liberals.\"\n:My job, my place in life, is to express the positive synthesis of values that has developed in Russian society.… Our society is one, and it's stupid to divide it into apartments – leftists here, patriots there, Democrats here. Near-political schizophrenics are easy to divide, but normal people don't.: they carry all the values. As for the love of liberals, I never speak out against democratic principles, but only against the perversion of these principles by liberal fundamentalists.\n\nInternational sanctions\nDue to support for Russian aggression and violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine during the Russian-Ukrainian war, he is under personal international sanctions from various countries.\nOn February 23, 2022, he was included in the sanctions lists of the European Union countries for actions and policies that undermine the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine and further destabilize Ukraine.\nOn February 24, 2022, he was included in Canada's sanctions list of \"close associates of the regime\" for voting to recognize the independence of the \"so-called republics in Donetsk and Lugansk\".\nOn March 24, 2022, amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, he was placed on the US sanctions list for \"complicity in Putin's war\" and \"supporting the Kremlin's efforts to invade Ukraine.\". The US State Department said that State Duma deputies are using their powers to persecute dissidents and political opponents, violating freedom of information, restricting human rights and fundamental freedoms of Russian citizens.\nFor similar reasons, it has been under UK sanctions since 11 March 2022. Under Swiss sanctions since 25 February 2022, under Australian sanctions since 26 February 2022, and under Japanese sanctions since 12 April 2022. By decree of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dated 7 September 2022, sanctions were imposed on Ukraine. Has been under sanctions by New Zealand since 3 May 2022.\nIn March 2022, Delyagin, responding to the activity of the Azerbaijani military in the temporary deployment zone of the Russian peacekeeping corps in Nagorno-Karabakh, said on the air of the 60 Minutes program on the Russia 24 channel: “The Azerbaijanis really violated the ceasefire. And ours said that they retreated after we talked to them. And they officially stated that they did not leave the occupied territories. So this policy of aggression on the part of the American satellites and in this case Turkey, on the part of the Turkish proxies, which we call a state. This is a real danger today. And if we do not punish for this harshly and unequivocally, then why do we need the oil industry of Azerbaijan, a simple question? We do not need it, and it is extremely vulnerable. If people do not understand words, then they will probably have to understand actions. If we do not do this, we will not exist. This is the only question.”. Shortly before this, Delyagin conducted a poll on his Telegram channel about whether it is acceptable to \"use tactical nuclear weapons to eliminate the oil industry of Azerbaijan\" after reposting an article by political scientist Dimitriev, who considered this possibility. Delyagin was criticized for these words by the press secretary of the Russian president Dmitry Peskov, the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova, deputy chairperson of the State Duma commission on parliamentary ethics Nikolai Arefyev, as well as Delyagin's ally in the party, secretary of the presidium Oleg Shein. The leader of the party \"A Just Russia - For Truth\" Sergei Mironov said that Delyagin's words about Azerbaijan do not reflect the party's position. The Azerbaijani embassy in Russia called Delyagin's speech \"delusional and provocative\"; deputies of the Azerbaijani parliament Mikhail Zabelin and Rasim Musabekov also criticized Delyagin's behavior. The Federal National-Cultural Autonomy of Azerbaijanis in Russia called on the Prosecutor General's Office of Russia to initiate a criminal case against Delyagin under Article 354 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (public calls to unleash an aggressive war), stating, in particular, that \"such statements and actions cannot in any way be called adequate, and the person who voiced and wrote this can even less be called mentally balanced.\" Delyagin later apologized to \"everyone who was frightened or offended, or insulted\" by his words, noting that he hoped \"that some part of the Azerbaijani bureaucracy will behave reasonably\" and reported that, \"as far as I can judge from the existing reaction, the call for respect for Russian peacekeepers and their difficult work was heard by its addressees.\" Following this, the Prosecutor General's Office of Azerbaijan initiated a criminal case against the deputy under Articles 101.2 (call for an aggressive war), 214.2.3. (terrorism - threat of use of weapons), 283.2.1 and 283.2.2 (national, social and religious hatred) and declared him wanted internationally through Interpol with the choice of a preventive measure in the form of detention in custody.\n\nPublications\nThe author of more than a thousand articles in Russia, the USA, Germany, France, Finland, China, India and elsewhere, the author of 16 monographs, the most famous of which are \"The Economy of Non-Payments\" (1997), \"The Ideology of Revival\" (2000), \"The World Crisis.

    "text": "When You Read This Letter (French: Quand tu liras cette lettre) is a 1953 French-Italian drama film directed by Jean-Pierre Melville and starring Philippe Lemaire, Juliette Gréco and Yvonne Sanson.\nIt was shot at the Billancourt Studios in Paris. Location filming also take place on the coast of Southern France where the film is set. The film's sets were designed by the art director Robert Gys.\nThe film was a commercial success and permitted Melville to acquire his own studios to make his future productions.\n\nSynopsis\nAfter their parents die in a road accident, a strongly moral young woman named Thérèse Voise leaves a convent shortly before taking her vows in order to care for her younger sister Denise and run the family stationery shop with her. Thérèse is very protective of Denise and becomes concerned when her sister strikes up an acquaintance with Max, a young amateur boxer and garage mechanic. Max is a self-centered, amoral drifter who is conducting numerous different relationships with girls at nightclubs. He is also pursuing Irène Faugeret, a wealthy married woman, managing to get employment as her chauffeur and become her lover. Max strikes up a friendship of sorts with Biquet, a bellhop at the Hôtel Carlton who acts as Max's eyes and ears, especially as concerns Madame Faugeret.\nDenise is attracted to Max, but after a chance meeting at the hotel he sexually assaults her. A distraught Denise attempts to drown herself, and is only narrowly saved from suicide. After she has recovered, Thérèse blackmails Max into getting engaged to Denise by threatening to reveal the circumstances to the police who are already investigating Max for the death in an automobile accident of Irène, his wealthy lover. Max was responsible for Irène Faugeret's death as he had loosened three screws on her car's steering column. Max did not expect her to use the car the night of the fatal accident. He expected Biquet would use it instead, part of their scheme to steal Irène's money and then flee to Tangiers to start a new life. Max was hoping to double-cross Biquet. Instead, he caused Irène Faugeret's death.\nDenise is delighted and optimistic about the future. However, Thérèse remains contemptuous of her future brother-in-law.\nMax tries to persuade Thérèse that he has fallen in love with her and attempts to seduce her. She rejects his advances, but it remains unclear to what extent she is attracted to him. Max tries to persuade her to run away with him to Tangiers where they can start a new life together. The sincerity of his actions remains in doubt even up to the moment when, having absconded with Denise's dowry and Thérèse's passport, he is killed by a train while trying to board it in order to complete his rendezvous with Thérèse. Philosophically accepting this turn of events, she returns to her convent to become a nun.\n\nCast\nReferences\nBibliography\nCrisp, C.G. The Classic French Cinema, 1930–1960.

It is the second-tallest building in both Wichita and the state of Kansas. In 2021, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nHistory\nThe Holiday Inn Plaza  hotel opened in July 1970, as part of the Garvey Center, which also contained two 10-story office towers. The hotel was the tallest building in Wichita until the Epic Center was built in 1987. Even today, it remains the building with the most floors in the state.\nOn August 11, 1976, Michael Soles, an unemployed welder from Sand Springs, Oklahoma, set up a sniper position on the hotel. Over the course of an eleven-minute shooting spree, he killed three and wounded six others. The gunman was eventually wounded by the police and taken into custody.\nThe hotel made an appearance in the 1976 film King Kung Fu (a low-budget knock-off of King Kong).\nThe hotel left Holiday Inn in 1987 and became the Century II Plaza Hotel. Beginning in 1997, it was gradually converted to an apartment building, with each apartment made by combining two old hotel rooms. The conversion was fully completed in 2015 and the tower was renamed 250 Douglas Place.\n\nSee also\nList of tallest buildings in Wichita\nList of tallest buildings by U.S. state\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Sedgwick County, Kansas\n\n\n== References ==",

In the first innings Norwell made 19 runs before being run out by Tim Groenewald helping Gloucestershire to 343. In the Derbyshire first innings, Norwell produced an impressive display bowling 11 overs taking 6 wickets for just 46 runs as he helped bowl Derbyshire out for just 157.

    "title": "No Surrender (2023)",
    "text": "The 2023 No Surrender was a professional wrestling event produced by Impact Wrestling. It took place on February 24, 2023, at Sam's Town Live in Sunrise Manor, Nevada, and aired on Impact Plus and YouTube. It was the 15th event under the No Surrender chronology. The event also featured wrestlers from partner promotion New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW).\nTen matches were contested at the event, including two on the pre-show and one taped as a digital exclusive. In the main event, Josh Alexander defeated Rich Swann to retain the Impact World Championship. In other prominent matches, Mickie James defeated Masha Slamovich to retain the Impact Knockouts World Championship, Steve Maclin defeated Brian Myers, Heath, and PCO in a four-way match to become the number one contender to the Impact World Championship, and Joe Hendry defeated Moose in a Dot Combat match to retain the Impact Digital Media Championship.\n\nProduction\nBackground\nNo Surrender is an annual professional wrestling event produced by Impact Wrestling. It was originally produced by Impact Wrestling (then known as Total Nonstop Action Wrestling), as a pay-per-view (PPV) event. The first one was held in July 2005, but when the PPV names were shuffled for 2006, it was moved to September. In December 2012, TNA announced that the event was canceled. The last event took place in the TNA Impact! Zone in September 2012. It was resumed as a special episode of Impact Wrestling between 2013 and 2015 and was then revived as an Impact Plus event in 2019.\nOn October 25, 2022, Impact Wrestling announced that No Surrender would take place on Friday, February 24, 2023, at the Sam's Town Live in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nStorylines\nThe event featured several professional wrestling matches that involve different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers will portray villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that build tension and culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches. Storylines are produced on Impact's weekly television program.\nAt Hard To Kill, Masha Slamovich defeated Deonna Purrazzo, Killer Kelly, and Taylor Wilde in a four-way match to become number one contender to the Impact Knockouts World Championship. Later in the main event, Mickie James defeated Jordynne Grace to win the title in a Title vs. Career match, the final match of her \"Last Rodeo\" campaign. On the subsequent episode of Impact!, Slamovich confronted James in the ring with a \"death warrant\" (a picture of James crossed out in Slamovich's blood), with Impact announcing that James will have her first title defense against Slamovich at No Surrender.\nOn the January 26 episode of Impact!, Rich Swann won the \"Golden Six-Shooter\" six-way elimination match, thus earning an Impact World Championship match against Josh Alexander at No Surrender.\nOn the February 2 episode of Impact!, a four-way match was announced for No Surrender to determine the next number one contender for the Impact World Championship. Qualifying matches would take place over the next two weeks. Brian Myers, PCO, Steve Maclin, and Heath qualified after defeating Dirty Dango, Shera, Rhino, and Eddie Edwards, respectively.\nAfter Impact Knockouts World Tag Team Champions The Death Dollz (Jessicka, Rosemary, and Taya Valkyrie) won their match on the February 9 episode of Impact!, they would be confronted by former associate Father James Mitchell. He claimed he was there to put a \"hex\" upon The Death Dollz before they would be ambushed from behind by The Hex (Allysin Kay and Marti Belle). Four days later, on February 13, Impact announced that The Hex will challenge The Death Dolls (represented by Jessicka and Valkyrie) for the titles at No Surrender.\nAt Hard To Kill, Joe Hendry defended the Impact Digital Media Championship against Moose. Initially, Moose seemed to have won after a low blow to Hendry, but the match was restarted by new Director of Authority Santino Marella – taking the place of Impact Executive Vice President Scott D'Amore for the time – where Hendry would defeat Moose to retain the title. For the next month, Hendry would be involved in a feud with Matt Cardona over the title after some goading from Moose to Cardona. On the February 9 episode of Impact!, Hendry successfully defended the title against Cardona, after which he also avoided an attack from Moose. The following week, Moose shattered Marella's car window, mistakenly believing the vehicle was Hendry's, to send a message to the champion. Tired of his actions, Marella booked a Dot Combat match for the Digital Media Championship between Hendry and Moose at No Surrender.\nOn the February 16 episode of Impact!, Santino Marella booked a live edition of Sirius XM show \"Busted Open Radio\" for No Surrender, where Tommy Dreamer and Bully Ray would sort out their issues (Busted Open host Dave LaGreca would be presiding as mediator). The following week, the two men participated in a Beat the Clock Challenge to determine who would have the first word at the event. Dreamer defeated Jason Hotch in 1:15, while Ray defeated Bhupinder Gujjar in just 32 seconds, giving him the honor of speaking first.\n\nEvent\nPre-show\nThere were two matches on the pre-show. In the opener, Deonna Purrazzo faced Gisele Shaw (with Jai Vidal). In the closing stages, unbeknownst to the referee, Savannah Evans blindsided Purrazzo, allowing Shaw to hit a knee strike for the win.\nAfter that, Jonathan Gresham took on Mike Bailey. In the end, as Bailey was looking for Ultima Weapon, Gresham countered it into a Schoolboy pin for the victory.\n\nPreliminary matches\nThe pay-per-view started with Frankie Kazarian taking on Kon (with Deaner, Angels, and Callihan). In the closing stages, as Angels was distracting the referee, Callihan carried a steel chair to hit Kazarian, but unintentionally hit Kon, allowing Kazarian to perform a Slingshot Cutter for the victory.\nThe next bout featured The Death Dollz (Jessicka and Taya Valkyrie) (with Rosemary) defending the Impact Knockouts World Tag Team Championship against The Hex. The match ended when The Hex were looking for Hex Marks The Spot, but Jessicka countered it into the Sick Driver to retain the titles.\nNext, Joe Hendry defended the Impact Digital Media Championship in a Dot Combat match against Moose. Moose performed an O'Connor Roll with the tights, but Hendry kicked out. Hendry performed the same manoeuver, also with the tights for the 1-2-3 pin.\nNext, David LaGreca hosted a live edition of Busted Open Radio with Tommy Dreamer and Bully Ray. Ray wanted to make \"amends\" but Dreamer did not initially accept. Dreamer began to accept, but Ray threw coffee into him and hit him with a glass flask.\nThe fourth match featured Heath, PCO, Brian Myers, and Steve Maclin in a four-way match to determine the #1 contender to the Impact World Championship. In the end, Heath delivered the Wake Up Call to Myers, as Eddie Edwards came down and hit PCO with a shovel. Maclin then hit the KIA on Heath for the pinfall victory.\nNext, Time Machine took on Bullet Club. Shelley and Sabin delivered Skull and Bones to Austin. Austin then rolled Sabin over to pickup the victory. \nThe penultimate match saw Mickie James defended the Impact Knockouts World Championship against Masha Slamovich.

    "text": "Standard Songs for Average People is an album by John Prine and Mac Wiseman, released in 2007 (see 2007 in music). Wiseman was 82 years old at the time of the recording and Prine was 60.\n\nReception\nWriting for Allmusic, critic Mark Deming wrote of the album \"The craft is strong on Standard Songs for Average People, but at its heart it sounds like two friends singing some old songs they love on a quiet evening, and that's part of the album's strength -- these are 14 songs sung by two guys who know a great tune when they hear it, and they allow these numbers to work their magic simply, which serves them very well.\" Music critic Don Grant wrote \"This release by veterans Prine and Wiseman doesn't break any new ground... As would be expected from two performers of this caliber, the tunes are well executed and come off with nary a hitch. If you're a new listener to this game, by all means pick it up and expand your horizons. However, for most, it's probably a shade on the redundant side.\" Mike Wilson of  The Green Man Review gave the album a positive rating, calling it \"an honest and heartfelt recording.\"\nCritic John Milward of the  No Depression wrote that the songs were \"hardly standard\" and the album \"an amiable picking party that evokes placid Sunday picnics more than rowdy Saturday nights. And while the results are pleasant enough, one can’t help but wish somebody had spiked the punchbowl.\"\n\nTrack listing\n\"Blue Eyed Elaine\" (Ernest Tubb) – 2:34\n\"Don't Be Ashamed of Your Age\" (Cindy Walker, Bob Wills) – 2:26\n\"I Forgot to Remember to Forget\" (Charlie Feathers, Stan Kesler) – 3:01\n\"I Love You Because\" (Leon Payne) – 4:22\n\"Pistol Packin' Mama\" (Al Dexter) – 2:43\n\"Saginaw, Michigan\" (Bill Anderson, Donald Wayne) – 2:55\n\"Old Dogs, Children and Watermelon Wine\" (Tom T.

    "title": "VBScript",
    "text": "VBScript (Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition) is a deprecated programming language for scripting on Microsoft Windows using Component Object Model (COM), based on classic Visual Basic and Active Scripting. It was popular with system administrators for managing computers and automating many aspects of computing environments, and has been installed by default in every desktop release of Microsoft Windows since Windows 98; in Windows Server since Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack; and optionally with Windows CE (depending on the device it is installed on).\nVBScript running environments include: Windows Script Host (WSH), Internet Explorer (IE), and Internet Information Services (IIS). The running environment is embeddable in other programs via the Microsoft Script Control (msscript.ocx).\nIn October 2023, Microsoft announced that VBScript was deprecated. In May 2024, a multi-phase deprecation schedule was announced with disabling it by default \"around 2027\" and removing it sometime later.\n\nHistory\nVBScript began as part of the Microsoft Windows Script Technologies, launched in 1996. This technology (which also included JScript) was initially targeted at web developers. During a period of just over two years, VBScript advanced from version 1.0 to 2.0, and over that time it gained support from Windows system administrators seeking an automation tool more powerful than the batch language first developed in the early 1980s. On August 1, 1996, Internet Explorer was released with features that included VBScript.\nIn version 5.0, the functionality of VBScript was increased with new features including regular expressions; classes; the With statement; the Eval, Execute, and ExecuteGlobal functions to evaluate and execute script commands built during the execution of another script; a function-pointer system via GetRef, and Distributed COM (DCOM) support.\nIn version 5.5, SubMatches were added to the regular expression class in VBScript, to finally allow script authors to capture the text within the expression's groups. That capability had already been available in JScript.\nWith the advent of the .NET Framework, the scripting team decided to implement future support for VBScript within ASP.NET for web development, and therefore no new versions of the VBScript engine would be developed. It would henceforth be supported by Microsoft's Sustaining Engineering Team, who are responsible for bug fixes and security enhancements. After announcing plans to remove support for VBScript, Microsoft suggested migrating to Windows PowerShell or JavaScript.\n\nEnvironments\nClient-side web\nIn a web page loaded by Internet Explorer, VBScript is similar in function to JavaScript. The VBScript code in the HTML is logic that interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM) of the page – allowing for functionality not possible in HTML alone. However, other web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox and Opera do not support VBScript. Therefore, when client-side scripting and cross-browser compatibility are required, developers usually choose JavaScript due to its wide cross-browser compatibility.\n\nActive server page\nVBScript is used for server-side web page functionality via Active Server Pages (ASP). The ASP engine, asp.dll, invokes vbscript.dll to run VBScript scripts. VBScript that is embedded in an ASP page is contained within <% and %> context switches. The following example displays the current time in 24-hour format.\n\nWindows script host\nVBScript can run directly in the operating system via the Windows Script Host (WSH). A script file, usually with extension .vbs can be run either via Wscript.exe for graphical user interface (GUI) or Cscript.exe for command line interface (CLI).\n\nWindows script file\nA Windows Script File (WSF), styled after XML, can include multiple VBS files and is therefore a library of VBScript code that can be reused in a modular way. The files have extension .wsf and can be executed using wscript.exe or cscript.exe, as with a .vbs file.\n\nHTML Application\nAn HTML Application (HTA) is styled after HTML. The HTML in the file is used to generate the user interface, and a scripting language such as VBScript is used for the program logic. The files have extension .hta and can be executed using mshta.exe.\n\nWindows Script Component\nVBScript can also be used in a Windows Script Component, an ActiveX-enabled script class that can be invoked by other COM-enabled applications. These files have extension .wsc.\n\nFunctionality\nLanguage features\nThe VBScript language is modeled on classic Visual Basic. Notable features include:\nA \"procedure\" is the main construct in VBScript for separating code into smaller modules. VBScript distinguishes between a function, which can return a result in an assignment statement, and a subroutine, which cannot. Parameters are positional, and can be passed by value or by reference.\nControl structures include the usual iterative and conditional Do Loops, If-Then-Else statements, and Case statements, with some more complex variants, such as ElseIf and nested control structures.\nAs a memory aid in coding, and certainly for readability, there are a large number of constants, such as True and False for logical values, vbOKCancel and vbYesNo for MsgBox codes, vbBlack and vbYellow for color values, vbCR for the carriage return character, and many others.\nVariables have \"Variant\" type by default, but it is possible (and sometimes necessary) to force a particular type (integer, date, etc.) using conversion functions (CInt, CDate, etc.)\nUser interaction is provided through the functions MsgBox and  InputBox which provide a simple dialogue box format for messages and input. Both functions display prompting messages, with the former returning a standard response, and the latter returning one user-supplied text or numeric value. For more elaborate GUI interaction with controls, VBScript can be used in combination with HTML, for example, in an HTML Application. Event-driven forms are not supported as in Visual Basic or Visual Basic for Applications.\nNames are not case-sensitive. However, it is considered a best practice of VBScript style to be consistent and to capitalize judiciously.\n\nVBScript functionalities\nWhen hosted by the Windows Script Host, VBScript provides numerous features which are common to scripting languages, but not available from Visual Basic 6.0. These features include:\n\nNamed and unnamed command line arguments\nStdin and stdout, which could be redirected\nWSH.Echo which writes to the console and cannot be redirected\nWSH.ExitCode which can be tested from DOS batch files, or by the process which invoked the script file\nNetwork printers\nNetwork shares\nSpecial folders, e.g. Desktop, Favorites, MyDocuments and so on\nNetwork user information, such as group membership\nMethods for runtime execution of text defined at runtime: Eval and Execute\nMethods for executing scripts on remote machines\nWindows Management Instrumentation (WMI)\nFunctionality for embedding a VBScript engine in other applications, using a widely known language\nCScript, the command line runner, provides options for:\n\nInteractive or batch mode\nInvoking debug mode from the command line\nError reporting including the line number\n\nAdditional functionality\nFile system management, file modification, and streaming text operations are implemented with the Scripting Runtime Library scrrun.dll. This provides objects such as FileSystemObject, File, and TextStream, which expose the Windows file system to the programmer.\nBinary file and memory I/O are provided by the \"ADODB.Stream\" class, which can also be used for string builders (to avoid excessive string concatenation, which can be costly), and to interconvert byte arrays and strings. Database access is made possible through ActiveX Data Objects (ADO), and the IIS Metabase can be manipulated using the GetObject() function with sufficient permissions (useful for creating and destroying sites and virtual directories). XML files and schemas can be manipulated with the Microsoft XML Library Application Programming Interfaces (msxml6.dll, msxml3.dll), which also can be used to retrieve content from the World Wide Web via the XMLHTTP and ServerXMLHTTP objects (class strings \"MSXML2.XMLHTTP.6.0\" and \"MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP.6.0\", respectively).\nFunctionality can also be added through ActiveX technologies. Security concerns have led to many ActiveX controls being blacklisted in the Internet Explorer process by Microsoft, which deploys the killbit via monthly Windows security updates to disable vulnerable Microsoft and third party code.\nProgrammers can utilize the extensibility via COM (ActiveX) modules to specifically equip the Script Host and VBScript with required or desired functions. The \"VTool\" component, for instance, adds a number of dialog windows, binary file access, and other functionality.\n\nDevelopment tools\nMicrosoft does not routinely make available an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for VBScript,  although the Microsoft Script Editor has been bundled with certain versions of Microsoft Office.\nFor debugging purposes the Microsoft Script Debugger can still be used in current Windows versions, even though the tool has not been updated in years. It allows the user to set break points in the VBScript code but the user interface is more than clumsy.\nThere are VBScript debuggers available from third-party sources, and many text editors offer syntax highlighting for the language.\nDuring execution, when an error occurs, the script host issues a message stating the type of error and the number of the offending line.\n\nUses\nAlthough VBScript is a general-purpose scripting language, several particular areas of use are noteworthy. First, it used to be widely used among system administrators in the Microsoft environment, but it has since been vastly surpassed by PowerShell. Second, VBScript is the scripting language for OpenText UFT One, a test automation tool. A third area to note is the adoption of VBScript as the internal scripting language for some embedded applications, such as industrial operator interfaces and human machine interfaces. The hierarchical DBMS InterSystems Caché (which has its roots in the language MUMPS) also supports an implementation of VBScript, Cache BASIC, for programming stored code.\nVBScript omits several useful features of the full Visual Basic, such as strong typing, extended error trapping and the ability to pass a variable number of parameters to a subroutine. However, its use is relatively widespread because it is easy to learn and because those who implement code in the language need not pay royalties to Microsoft as long as the VBScript trade mark is acknowledged. When an organization licenses Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) from Microsoft, as companies such as Autodesk, StatSoft, Great Plains Accounting and Visio (subsequently acquired by Microsoft) have done, it is allowed to redistribute the full VBA code-writing and debugging environment with its product.\nVBScript is used in place of VBA as the macro language of Outlook 97.\nVBScript can be effectively used for automating day to day office tasks as well as monitoring in the Windows-based environment. It can also be used in collaboration with ADODB ActiveX Data Objects (ADODB) for effective database connectivity.\nVBScript can also be used to create malware and viruses, such as the ILOVEYOU worm that spread through email attachment in Outlook 97 that cost billions of dollars.\n\nSee also\nAppleScript\nFastTrack Scripting Host\nHTML Components\nJavaScript\nJScript .NET\nJScript\nPerlScript\nWindows PowerShell\nWindows Script File\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nVBScript Language Reference, Microsoft Docs\nIs VBScript Dead?, isvbscriptdead.com\nVBScript Commands, ss64.com\nVBScript How-to guides and examples, ss64.com\nWMI Overview, Microsoft TechNet",

    "title": "Fruitville, Florida",
    "text": "Fruitville is a census-designated place (CDP) in Sarasota County, Florida, United States. The population was 15,484 at the 2020 census, up from 13,224 at the 2010 census. It is part of the North Port–Bradenton–Sarasota, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.\n\nHistory\nAn 1857 map of the \"Country in the Vicinity of Manatee\" during the Third Seminole War shows settlers near what is now Fruitville. The area had a large sawgrass swamp that was bounded on the east by Tatum Ridge (named for the George Tatum Sr., 1822–1910), north and west by Phillippi Creek with its headwaters in the Meadows residential development through Circus Hammock and Bobby Jones municipal golf course and Bee Ridge to the south. This marshland was home to wild Florida Cracker cattle.\nIn 1923, the Sarasota-Fruitville drainage district was established (see also Bertha Palmer family). The new district provided around 8,000 acres of land for cultivation near the community of Fruitville. The farm land was formed by draining the historic wetland and dredging a drainage canal to Phillippi Creek, which drained roughly 26,000 acres. This area was later reclaimed as a wetland, and became the Celery Fields Regional Stormwater Facility.\nAfter the Civil War, a new wave of pioneers began to settle in Florida thanks to a growing citrus industry. In 1876, Charles Reaves (1847–1931) settled in what is now considered Fruitville. According to some sources, he was the one who named the area Fruitville after the abundance of fruit in the area. In 1895, Reaves would go on to become the postmaster for the area's 115 residents.\nThe first church in what is now Sarasota County was the Friendship Baptist Church established by Reverend John Wright Hendry (1836–1907). The church was chartered in 1875 and a small pine log structure was used for the congregation until a new church was erected in 1876, using some of the original lumber from the first church. From 1877 to 1891, Isaac Alderman Redd (1835–1912) was pastor of the Friendship Baptist Church which first met in the Bee Ridge community. In 1887, the Florida Mortgage and Investment Company of Scotland donated land in Fruitville to the church for the establishment of the community's first cemetery.\nAlso in 1887, Charles and his wife Martha Tatum Reaves (daughter of George Tatum Sr.,1853-1935) converted their corncrib into Fruitville's first school for their three children and seven neighbors. They went on to hire Miss Josie Clower as the first teacher in the area. After citizens petitioned for a modern school building, funding was granted from the Works Progress Administration to build Fruitville Elementary in 1941. Rural schools in the nearby villages of Tatum Ridge and Old Miakka were closed, with their students bussed to the new school in Fruitville.\nA map from 1902 shows Fruitville on the map as a community.\nIn May 1918, Franklin Field (named after then-mayor George Franklin) began operating as a military airfield during World War I. The Franklin airfield was located north of Fruitville Road and east of what is now Tuttle road. The airfield was an auxiliary landing station for the U.S. Army Air Service and housed, at the least, several Curtiss JN \"Jenny\" planes. With the war over, the airfield saw less and less traffic and was likely unused by 1920. In 1924 the land was developed for a new subdivision.\nThe first municipal airport in Sarasota county was located in Fruitville. It was dedicated in 1929, located on a 160-acre site near the intersection of 12th Street and Beneva Road (then named Oriente Avenue). The airport was renamed Lowe Field after Johnny Lowe purchased the land during World War II. After the war, most civilian air traffic moved to the Sarasota-Bradenton Airport. Lowe Field closed in 1961 and the land was sold.\nThroughout the 1960s and 70s, there was a migrant camp called Sababo in Fruitville that supplied much of the labor force for area's farm industry. A major crop in the area was celery. In 1966, there was an estimated 2,000 migrant workers in Sarasota County. To provide healthcare and education to this population, on December 5, 1966, the Fruitville Area Medical and Educational (FAME) Center was opened.\nIn November 1990, Litchfield's Cinema 10 opened in the Sarasota Commons, the community's first modern movie theater. As a promotion, the theater offered tickets for only 50 cents during its opening. Some of the films shown for its pre-opening weekend were Pretty Woman and Back to the Future III.\n\nOn December 8, 2001, the Fruitville Library was opened to serve the Fruitville community as a part of the Sarasota County Library System. The library was initially called East County Library throughout its land-use planning process before the Sarasota County Commission renamed the library a month prior to its opening.\n\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 7.13 square miles (18.46 km2), of which 6.83 square miles (17.68 km2) is land and 0.30 square miles (0.78 km2), or 4.21%, is water.\n\nDemographics\nAs of the 2020 United States census, there was a population of 15,484 people and 6,043 households. There were 2.32 persons per household.\nIn terms of age, 4% were under 5 years old, 15% were 18 years or younger, 45% were between 18 and 64, and %26 were 65 years or older. 80.9% of the population was white (non-Hispanic), 2.1% was black or African American, 2.4% was Asian, and 12.5% was Hispanic or Latino. There were 1,172 veterans living in Fruitville and 12.9% of the population was Foreign born.\nThe median value of owner-occupied housing units was $275,600 and the median gross rent was $1,639. Median household income was $72,512. 7.6% of the population lived below the poverty threshold. 92.6% of households had a computer and 88.1% had a broadband internet subscription.\nOf the population 25 years and older, 91.0% had a high school degree or higher and 33.0% of that same population had a bachelor's degree or higher.\nOf the population under 65 years old, 6.8% lived with a disability and 17.2% did not have health insurance.\n\nEducation\nFruitville is home to several public and private schools including:\n\nFruitville Elementary\nJulie Rohr Academy\nLearning Academy of Sarasota\nMcIntosh Middle School\nSarasota Academy of the Arts\nSarasota Christian School\nSaint Martha's Catholic School\nSaint Mary Academy\nIt is also home to the Fruitville Library, a branch of the Sarasota County Library System.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "Kevin of the North is a 2001 American comedy film directed by Bob Spiers. It stars Skeet Ulrich, Natasha Henstridge, Leslie Nielsen, and Rik Mayall and is about an Alaskan Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race in which Kevin Manley, whose grandfather has died and now must participate in the state's Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race in order to prove he's worthy enough for his grandfather's estate. The film was released to DVD in the United States with the alternate title of Chilly Dogs on February 4, 2003.\n\nPlot\nKevin Manley (Skeet Ulrich), a Los Angeles travel agent, receives the message that his grandpa has passed and left everything to him. However, he must go to Alaska in order to collect his inheritance. He leaves Canoga Park (Los Angeles), quits his job, despite his boss warning him that he will give up and decide to come back begging for his job back, and heads to Anchorage, Alaska.\nUpon arrival, Manley finds out that if he proves he is manly by participating in the yearly Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race he can obtain the land that his grandfather left to him and if he doesn't participate, the land wouldn't be signed over.\nWhile in Alaska, he meets some other participants including: the beautiful Bonnie Livengood (Natasha Henstridge), the stupid English Carter (Rik Mayall), ex-sheriff Ned Parker (Lochlyn Munro) and the local attorney Clive Thornton (Leslie Nielsen) who initially informed him of conditions of the race.\nManley eventually discovers a box of various items that had belonged to his grandfather that included a fur cap and coat, a sword, and a diary which informed Manley that his grandfather had found gold on the land with a relative of a participant he had met earlier, Bonnie Livengood.\nWhile preparing for the event, two other participants, Clive and Carter, attempt to sabotage Manley's chances at winning the race so they can get the land and the gold. Clive promises to pay Carter a thousand dollars if he could prevent Kevin from entering or even finishing the race. Carter succeeds in stealing Kevin's team of huskies and burning down the shed containing his sled, tent, and supplies.\nDespite his losses, Kevin uses some of his remaining savings to buy a new sled, a tent, some winter clothing, and food supplies for him and his dogs. He also buys a new team of dogs to replace the ones he lost: Farty, a Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever, Trooper, a German Shepherd, Pierre, a black poodle, Barker, a large dark-brown wiry-haired mongrel, Gumly, a large St. Bernard, Snowflake, a white American bulldog, and a Jack Russell terrier named Riddles.\nAfter the Iditarod race begins and the teams head off into the wilderness, Kevin begins to learn how to survive on the trail and face the perils that seem to pull on him. He and his dogs begin to form a bond of friendship. Along the trail, Kevin rescues Bonnie from Parker, who was in the process of trying to rape her, and gives him the \"Canoga Park Coffee Zap\", in which he pours hot coffee on his private area. Shortly afterwards, Bonnie and Kevin form a deep relationship and fall in love with each other.\nClive and Carter, who are both anxious to have Kevin lose, try several plans to stop Kevin from finishing the race. Carter cuts half of one of the lines attached to the sled, in which it snaps free as the team rush on down the trail and Kevin has an accident, but is rescued by an Indian tribe and nursed back to health. Another night, Clive and Carter scatter strips of meat around the camp, which attracts a grizzly bear that tears down Kevin's tent and scares him and his dogs off. After the duo blow up Kevin's grandfather's cabin with dynamite, Kevin soon finds out of Clive's and Carter's plan and warn them both to stay away from him and his team.\nWhile camping in a snow cave during a blizzard, Bonnie and Kevin discover a map inside Kevin's jacket that belonged to his grandfather. The map tells them of a place known as Wolf Mountain, where Kevin believes that his grandfather hid his gold. When the storm clears, they reach Wolf Mountain and recovered the chest full of gold nuggets underneath the snow.\nUnfortunately, Clive and Carter arrive, take the chest of gold, and take Bonnie hostage after burying Kevin in the spot where they uncovered the gold. However, Kevin orders his lead dog, Farty to dig him out and he follows Clive and Bonnie all the way to Nome, which is the finish line of the Iditarod Sled Dog race. He manages to beat Parker and Carter, wins the race, and races onward to cut off Thornton's escape. He rescues Bonnie and Clive draws out a gun and fires at them, but he misses. The bullet glances off several metal objects inside an abandoned garage and finally hits an oil barrel, which blows up the garage with Clive inside it. At the same moment, the gold survives the explosion and falls around Bonnie and Kevin, who are surprised and overjoyed.\nClive, who had recently survived the explosion, and Carter are arrested for their actions against Kevin and Bonnie, and Kevin is rewarded with the prize money of the race, a gold cup, and a bouquet of flowers, which he gives to Bonnie.

    "text": "Bernard of Cluny (or, of Morlaix or Morlay) was a twelfth-century French  Benedictine monk, best known as the author of De contemptu mundi (On Contempt for the World), a long verse satire in Latin.\n\nLife\nBernard's family of origin and place of birth are not known for certain.  Some medieval sources list Morlaàs in Béarn, as his birthplace.  However, in some records from that period he is called Morlanensis, which would indicate that he was a native of Morlaix in Brittany. A writer in the Journal of Theological Studies (1907), Volume 8, pages 394–399, contended that he belonged to the family of the seigneurs of Montpellier in Languedoc, and was born at Murles.  It is believed that he was at first a monk of Saint-Sauveur d'Aniane and that he entered the monastery of Cluny during the administration of Abbot Pons (1109–1122).\n\nWorks\nBernard is best known as the author of De contemptu mundi (On Contempt for the World), a 3,000 verse poem of stinging satire directed against the secular and religious failings he observed in the world around him.  He spares no one; priests, nuns, bishops, monks, and even Rome itself are mercilessly scourged for their shortcomings. For this reason it was first printed by Matthias Flacius in Varia poemata de corrupto ecclesiae statu (Basle, 1557) as one of his testes veritatis, or witnesses of the deep-seated corruption of medieval society and of the Church, and was often reprinted by Protestants in the course of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.\nBernard of Cluny also wrote the twelfth century hymn  \"Omni die dic Mariae\" (Daily, daily sing to Mary). Several of Bernard's sermons and a theological treatise, Dialogue (Colloquium) on the Trinity are extant, as is a c. 1140 poem which he dedicated to the monastery's abbot Peter the Venerable (1122–1156).\n\nVeneration\nOn 19 March 1895, a cause for Bernard's beatification was formally opened, and he was given the title Servant of God.\n\nHymns\n'Hic breve vivitur'\n'Hora novissima'\n'O hona patria'\n'Urbs Sion aurea'\n\nBibliography\nBernardus Morlanensis, De contemptu mundi, Une vision du monde vers 1144 - Bernard le Clunisien.

    "title": "LaSalle D. Leffall Jr.",
    "text": "LaSalle D. Leffall Jr. (May 22, 1930 – May 25, 2019) was an American surgeon, surgical oncologist, and medical educator. He chaired the Department of Surgery at Howard University College of Medicine from 1970 to 1995  and served as the Charles R. Drew Professor  of Surgery. In 1978, Leffall became the first African American president of the American Cancer Society, and in 1995, he became the first African American president of the American College of Surgeons.\n\nEarly life and education\nLaSalle Doheny Leffall Jr. was born on May 22, 1930, in Tallahassee, Florida, and raised in nearby Quincy, Florida, during the era of segregation. His parents, LaSalle D. Leffall Sr. and Lula Jourdan Leffall, were both educators and emphasized the value of academic excellence and perseverance despite racial barriers. His father was a professor of agriculture at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College (FAMU), and his mother was also a teacher.\nLeffall graduated from Dr. Wallace S. Stevens High School in 1945 at age 15, and earned a B.S. degree in biology, summa cum laude, from Florida A&M University in 1948. He received his M.D. from the Howard University College of Medicine in 1952. Initially rejected from admission, Leffall was accepted after FAMU President William H. Gray personally intervened on his behalf. He graduated first in his class. His mentors included Charles R. Drew, Burke Syphax, W. Montague Cobb, and Jack E. White.\nHe completed his internship at Homer G. Phillips Hospital  in St. Louis, followed by surgical training as an assistant resident in surgery at Freedmen's Hospital (1953–1954), assistant resident at D.C. General Hospital (1954–1955), and chief resident at Freedmen’s (1956–1957). Leffall then became one of the first Black fellows in surgical oncology at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, where he trained from 1957 to 1959 under the mentorship of Dr. Jack E. White.\n\nWhile attending Howard, he met Ruth McWilliams, who was struck by his polite demeanor, intelligence, kindness toward others, and strong dedication to his studies. They married in 1956 and later had a son, LaSalle “Donney” Leffall III.\n\nMilitary service\nIn 1960, Leffall entered the United States Army Medical Corps with the rank of Captain, M.C.. He was stationed at Ft. Sam Houston  in Texas before being assigned as chief of general surgery at the U.S. Army Hospital in Munich, Germany. He completed two years of active duty and was later honorably discharged with the rank of Major.\nDuring his Army service, Leffall encountered racial segregation despite holding an officer’s commission. He recalled that, while stationed at Ft. Sam Houston in Texas, he and three White colleagues went to a local movie theater. Although his White colleagues were allowed to enter, Leffall was denied admission solely because of his race. In a show of solidarity, his colleagues chose to leave with him. Leffall later described the incident as one of the most painful experiences of his life, underscoring the irony of facing racial discrimination at home while preparing to serve his country abroad.\n\nMilitary insignia\nBelow are the official insignia representing his military rank and medical branch of service:\n\nCareer, leadership, and honors\nAfter completing his surgical oncology fellowship and fulfilling his Army commitment, Leffall joined the faculty of the Howard University College of Medicine in 1962. In 1970, he became one of the youngest chairs—and the first African American—to lead the Department of Surgery at Howard. In 1992, he was appointed the first Charles R. Drew Professor of Surgery, named in honor of the pioneering surgeon and medical innovator.\nThroughout his more than five decades at Howard, Leffall was a dedicated educator and mentor, teaching approximately 6,000 medical students and training nearly 300 general surgery residents.\n\nLeffall also made landmark contributions to national medical leadership. In 1978, he became the first African American elected president of the American Cancer Society. During his tenure, he launched the organization’s first national cancer disparities initiative, which addressed the rising cancer burden among African Americans and became a national model for equity in cancer care.\nHe went on to become the first Black president of the American College of Surgeons in 1995, and also led the Society of Surgical Oncology and the Society of Surgical Chairmen—breaking racial barriers and paving the way for underrepresented groups in surgical leadership.\nIn public health advocacy, Leffall served as board chair of the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation from 2002 to 2007 and again from 2011 to 2012, where he championed efforts to improve outreach, screening, and treatment access in minority communities.\nAppointed by President George W. Bush and reappointed by President Barack Obama, Leffall chaired the President’s Cancer Panel from 2002 to 2011, advising the White House on cancer policy, disparities, and national prevention strategies.\nIn this role, he testified before Congress and federal agencies to advocate for stronger national cancer control policies. Key appearances included:\n\nAddressing the House Subcommittee on Health in 2004 to present the President’s Cancer Panel Annual Report on barriers in the National Cancer Program.\nParticipating in the 2007 congressional forum, Reducing Health Disparities: Bridging the Gap, where he highlighted inequities in cancer outcomes and called for targeted interventions.\nProviding expert testimony to the United States Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies on federal cancer control programs and minority health outcomes in 2003.\n\nLeffall’s reputation extended globally through his affiliations with international medical bodies, including the Royal College of Surgeons of England, the German Surgical Society, the International Society of Surgery, the West African College of Surgeons, and the College of Surgeons of South Africa.\nThroughout his career, LaSalle D. Leffall Jr. received 14 honorary degrees from institutions including Georgetown University, Amherst College, Meharry Medical College, and Princeton University. He was elected to the National Academy of Medicine, joining the highest ranks of the U.S. medical and scientific community.\nAmong his many honors, Leffall received the prestigious Candace Award for Science in 1983 from the National Coalition of 100 Black Women. In 1984, the American Cancer Society awarded him its Distinguished Service Award, one of the organization's highest honors, recognizing his exemplary leadership and long-standing commitment to cancer prevention and education.\nHe was also the first recipient of the Society of Surgical Oncology’s Heritage Award in 2001, recognizing his trailblazing role in cancer surgery and mentorship.\nIn 1995, Leffall’s former students and colleagues established the LaSalle D. Leffall Jr. Surgical Society at the Howard University College of Medicine to honor his impact as a mentor and educator. His enduring legacy also inspired the creation of the biennial LaSalle D. Leffall Jr. Cancer Prevention and Control Award, presented jointly by MD Anderson Cancer Center and the Intercultural Cancer Council.\nBeyond his clinical and policy work, Leffall held interim senior administrative positions at Howard, including as interim senior vice president and provost, while continuing to teach and mentor students until his death in 2019.\n\nThe price of courage\nIn a 1979 interview  with The Washington Post, Dr. LaSalle Leffall reflected on the emotional cost of taking principled stands, referencing the controversy surrounding Muhammad Ali’s refusal to be drafted during the Vietnam War based on religious and racial beliefs. Leffall, who had by then built a respected medical career, acknowledged the challenge of maintaining high standards while breaking new ground as a Black physician. He emphasized that being among the first came with pressure to excel, as he felt he could not afford to fall short or set a poor example for those who would  follow.\nMentorship played a consistent role in Leffall’s career. Dr. Wendy Greene, who trained at Howard University, recalled his reflections  on what he called the “Grace Notes” of life—small but meaningful gestures that could enhance doctor–patient relationships. She noted that he emphasized the importance of listening not only to patients’ words, but also to the concerns behind them.\nLeffall’s professional approach emphasized discipline, attentiveness, and sustained involvement in patient care. His contributions focused on practice and teaching rather than public attention.\n\nDeath, personal life, and legacy\nLeffall died of cancer on May 25, 2019, in Washington, D.C., at the age of 89. He is survived by his wife, Ruth Leffall; his son, LaSalle D. Leffall III, also known as \"Donney\"; his sister, Dolores C. Leffall.\n\nLegacy and impact\nLaSalle D. Leffall Jr. was the first African American president of both the American Cancer Society and the American College of Surgeons, advancing diversity in national medical leadership.\nAs chair of surgery at Howard University College of Medicine, he trained generations of physicians and surgeons who went on to lead in academia, health policy, and clinical care.\nLeffall championed cancer prevention and efforts to reduce health disparities, shaping national strategies focused on underserved communities.\nSeveral honors have been established in his name, including the LaSalle D. Leffall Jr. Cancer Prevention and Control Award and the surgical society founded at Howard University.\nDr. Wayne A. I. Frederick, president of Howard University and former mentee, reflected:\n\nDr. LaSalle D. Leffall, Jr. was a surgeon, oncologist, medical educator, civic leader, and mentor to me and so many others. [...] Even at the height of his achievements, Dr. Leffall remained accessible, generous, and deeply committed to students and patients. I will always cherish performing my first operation as a fully accredited surgeon alongside him—his final surgery before retirement. In many ways, Dr. Leffall was, is, and always will be our ever-burning fire.\n\nIn popular culture\nLaSalle D. Leffall Jr. is prominently featured in the National Library of Medicine’s Opening Doors: Contemporary African American Academic Surgeons exhibit, which recognizes his groundbreaking career as a surgical oncologist, educator, and national leader. The exhibit highlights his role as the first African American president of the American Cancer Society, his chairmanship at Howard University College of Medicine, and his advocacy for cancer prevention and health equity. Through this national exhibition, Leffall’s enduring legacy is showcased as an inspiration for future generations of physicians and surgeons.\n\nAwards, honors, leadership roles, and fellowships\nLeadership roles\nFellowships and awards\nHonorary degrees\nSelected publications\nMedia\nThe Washington Post: Dr. LaSalle Leffall, Howard University cancer surgeon and medical educator, dies at 89 (May 29, 2019).

    "title": "Ciné-Kodak",
    "text": "The Ciné-Kodak was the first movie camera for 16 mm, manufactured by the Eastman Kodak Company and introduced in 1923. It was intended for home movie making. Kodak released additional models, including magazine-loading cameras as the Magazine Ciné-Kodak line and a line of 8 mm cameras under the Ciné-Kodak Eight sub-brand. The final 16 mm camera was the Kodak Reflex Special, released in 1961, dropping the Ciné-Kodak brand altogether; Kodak ceased production of 16 mm cameras in 1968, but continued to produce 8 mm and Super 8 film cameras under the Ektasound and Instamatic brands.\n\nHistory and models\nKodak introduced 16 mm film in June 1923 alongside the first Ciné-Kodak, a movie camera that was both more portable and affordable than those using 35 mm film; the new camera and film type were more suited for amateur use and generally are credited as the enabling technology for the creation of the first home movies.\n\nLettered models\nThe initial prototype was a leather covered rectangular wooden box, which evolved into a cast aluminum box when the camera was released, approximately 8×8.5×4.5 in (200×220×110 mm) (H×L×W). The first Ciné-Kodak was cranked by hand at two turns per second to achieve the necessary 16 frames per second. Hand cranking meant that a tripod was essential to achieve a steady image. The camera was equipped with a fixed 1-inch (25mm) lens. Early in 1924 a battery-powered electric motor attachment was introduced, but this accessory was discontinued in 1926, at which time an improved version of the camera with an interchangeable Kodak Anastigmat f/1.9 lens was introduced. The lens focal range was 2 to 50 feet and INF (infinity). The only additional lens offered was a 78mm f/4.5 telephoto. With the discontinuation of the motor, additional crank accessories were introduced: one for single frames, and one with a 4:1 gear ratio for slow motion work.\n\nIn 1925, Kodak followed with a spring motor-driven Ciné-Kodak Model B, at which time the original Ciné-Kodak was re-designated as Model A, though that designation was not added to the camera nameplate until November 1929. A full winding of the spring would run the Model B motor for about fifteen to twenty feet of film. The Model B was available with fixed-focus f/6.5 and f/3.5 lenses, along with a version with a focusing f/1.9 lens; these cameras were intended for the amateur, while the Model A was retained as suitable for the advanced amateur. Special Editions of the Model B were released with ostrich leather covering the camera body and carrying case. In 1927, the Kodak list prices for Ciné-Kodak ranged from US$225 (equivalent to $4,070 in 2024) for the Model A with f/1.9 lens and tripod to US$75 (equivalent to $1,360 in 2024) for the Model B with f/6.5 lens. Production of Model A ceased in 1930; the Model B in 1931.\n\nIn 1929, a Model BB for 50-foot reels and an additional 8 frames/second speed was introduced, followed by the Model K in 1930, which was an enlarged BB for 100-ft reels. As furnished with a f/3.5 Anastigmat lens, in 1934 the Model K was listed at US$112.50 (equivalent to $2,640 in 2024). The Model K was joined briefly by a stripped-down Model M, but the latter camera did not sell well since it lacked some of the very features that made the Model K appealing.\nIn 1937, the Model E was introduced with a shape similar to the later Pathé Webo camera and provided slow motion speeds and an internal viewfinder instead of the open frame types used hitherto.\n\nEnd of production\nThe final 16 mm spool loading camera, the Ciné-Kodak Model K-100, arrived in 1955 in both three-lens turret and non-turret versions, using the Bell & Howell-developed C mount for interchangeable lenses. In 1961, Kodak dropped the Ciné-Kodak branding, releasing the Kodak Reflex Special to compete with the Arriflex 16ST, featuring continuous reflex viewing; this last 16 mm camera manufactured by Kodak did not sell well and was discontinued in 1968.\nThe 16 mm Ciné-Kodaks were well-made, long-lived cameras. Most have double claws and double sprockets and hence require double perf (2R) film in unmodified form. The exceptions are both the Specials and K100 models that were designed for single perf (1R) film, which allowed for the addition of sound tracks.\n\nProfessional cameras\nIn 1933, the Ciné-Kodak Special was introduced for advanced amateur and semi-professional work, and quickly became popular with professionals for its vast range of capabilities. A new universal Kodak S-mount was introduced with this camera, although the Special required an adapter to use S-mount lenses.\nThe Ciné-Kodak Special II was introduced in 1948 with a diverging turret to allow for mounting a longer second lens without interfering with the field of view of the shorter focal length, but was otherwise unchanged from the Special. The Special II was discontinued in 1961.\n\nMagazine cameras\nKodak released the first of a line of magazine-loading cameras sold under the Magazine Ciné-Kodak sub-brand in 1936, made initially in Kodak's Nagel Works in Germany. Like the Model E, the initial Magazine Ciné-Kodak included 1⁄2× and 1⁄4× slow-motion speeds (32 and 64 fps). This was superseded by the Ciné-Kodak Magazine 16 (1945–1950), which had few differences, and the Ciné-Kodak Royal Magazine (1950), which featured an enclosed viewfinder.\n\n8mm cameras\nKodak also sold 8 mm movie cameras starting from 1932 under the Ciné-Kodak Eight sub-brand. The first Eights included the Ciné-Kodak Eight, Model 20, which had a 13 mm (1⁄2-in) f/3.5 lens; the Model 25, which closely resembled the 20, but was equipped with a faster f/2.7 lens; and the Model 60, which had an even faster f/1.9 lens which could be exchanged for a 11⁄2-in (38 mm) f/4.5 telephoto lens. The lower price of the Model 20 opened home movie production to a broader market, listing for US$34.50 (equivalent to $810 in 2024) in 1934. The Ciné-Kodak Eights used double-run 8 mm film, which exposed first one half, then after the take-up reel was swapped with the supply reel, the other half of 16 mm-wide film, otherwise identical to standard 16 mm double-perf film, but with twice the number of sprocket holes; after developing, the processor would split the film and splice it together.\nThe next major development was the introduction of magazine loading, with the Magazine Ciné-Kodak Eight, Model 90, introduced in 1940, sharing the same lens mount with the 16 mm Magazine Ciné-Kodak; the Model 90 was replaced by the Ciné-Kodak Magazine 8 in 1946, which had only minor cosmetic upgrades from the Model 90. The Magazine 8 was discontinued in 1948.\nDuring the 1950s, Kodak continued to produce simple double-run 8 mm movie cameras with fixed lenses under the venerable Brownie name. In 1965, Kodak introduced the Super 8 film format along with a line of Instamatic-branded Super 8 cameras, replacing the older Ciné-Kodak Eight and Brownie movie cameras.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\nSee also\nHistory of photography\nHistory of the camera",

    "title": "Marshall's Mill",
    "text": "Marshall's Mill is a former flax spinning mill on Marshall Street in Holbeck, Leeds, West Yorkshire, England.\nMarshall's Mill was part of a complex begun in 1791–92 by English industrial pioneer John Marshall. It was originally a four-storey mill, drawing water from the nearby Hol Beck. A Boulton & Watt steam engine was installed to assist water power. Rapid expansion followed with the addition of Mill 'B' (1794) adjacent to a warehouse built to service the original mill (all now demolished.)\nIt was to eventually supplant Yorkshire's previous cottage industry of hand driven spindles. \nAs the business continued to expand further mills, warehouses, engine houses, and reservoirs were added on the south side of Hol Beck. The six storey Mill 'C' was added in 1815–16, Mill 'D' followed in 1826–27, and Mill 'E' (which is aligned to the roadside and joined Mill 'C' to Mill 'D') in 1829–31. \nTemple Mill, in the form of an Egyptian Temple, was built between 1838 and 1841.  Later, the complex employed over 2,000 factory workers. When it was completed it was considered to be one of the largest factories in the world, with 7,000 steam-powered spindles. The addition of the Temple Mill completed development of mills by Marshall & Sons on this site. All of the mill buildings added from 1815 still exist. \nIn the early years, child labour was employed. In 1832 Marshall's political opponents alleged that:\n\n'In Mr Marshall's mill, a boy of 9 years of age was stripped to the skin, bound to an iron pillar, and mercilessly beaten with straps, until he fainted.'\n\nBut other reports claim that Marshall treated his workers better than most factory owners: overseers were forbidden to use corporal punishment to control the workers, and Marshall installed fans and attempted to regulate the temperature of the mill.  In 1844, Marshall and a neighbouring engineering firm, Taylor, Wordsworth and Co broke new ground by organising an away weekend in Liverpool for their workers, a novelty which caused even the editor of the normally liberal Leeds Mercury some concern:\n\n'Entirely approving of excursions for the working class, and with the kindest feelings towards the workmen of Messrs Marshall and Messrs Taylor and Wordsworth, we would express our earnest hope that the Sunday spent in Liverpool may not in any respect be spent in a manner unbecoming the day ... There are many excellent men among the above bodies of workmen, and great responsibility will rest upon them for the issue of this new and somewhat doubtful experiment, of a large body of people being away from home on the Sabbath, and on two whole nights.'\n\nMarshall & Sons ceased production in 1886. The site was taken over by other textile producers.\nMarshall's Mill is now a grade II* listed building.\nThe site was comprehensively redeveloped in the late 1990s. It is now used as office space for several companies. There are plans to further redevelop the site as part of Holbeck Urban Village.\n\nSee also\nGrade II* listed buildings in Leeds\nListed buildings in Leeds (City and Hunslet Ward - southern area)\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nHistoric England. \"Former flax warehouse to Marshall Mills (Grade II*) (1375161)\".

    "text": "On Call is an American police procedural and serial drama created by Tim Walsh and Elliot Wolf for streaming on IMDb TV. The series stars Troian Bellisario and Brandon Larracuente and follows law enforcement officers of the Long Beach Police Department in California. The series was initially ordered in May 2021, with Elliot's father, Dick Wolf, attached as an executive producer with his production company, Wolf Entertainment. Ben Watkins later joined as the showrunner and also executive produced the show alongside Walsh, Elliot Wolf, and others.\nIt is the first streaming television series from Dick Wolf, as well as the first of his to be produced in a half-hour format. The program later shifted its release to Amazon Prime Video. Other members of the cast and crew include those who previously worked with Wolf on his other franchises. The show was filmed on-location in Long Beach in 2023 and utilized experimental techniques. On Call's eight episodes were released on January 9, 2025, with a soundtrack album following the day after. It received mixed reviews from critics. In May 2025, the series was canceled after one season, but is being shopped to other streaming platforms.\n\nPremise\nOn Call follows Traci Harmon, a senior training officer with the Long Beach Police Department tasked with training rookie officer Alex Diaz. Throughout the episodes, Harmon and Diaz respond to emergency calls in Long Beach, California. An overarching story arc revolves around Harmon, Diaz, and other officers, assisting in the murder investigation of a fellow officer who was killed during a routine traffic stop. The series deals with the effects on the professional and personal lives of the officers involved in the case.\n\nCast and characters\nEpisodes\nProduction\nDevelopment\nIn May 2021, IMDb TV ordered On Call, a half-hour police procedural to be executive produced by Dick Wolf. It is the first scripted streaming television series and the first half-hour drama from Wolf, who has a history of working with broadcast networks. His production company, Wolf Entertainment, as well as Universal Television, ATTN:, and Amazon MGM Studios were attached to produce the show. It was reported that Ben Watkins would be the series' showrunner and would executive produce it alongside Wolf's son, Elliot Wolf. Derek Haas, Peter Jankowski, and Arthur W. Forney, with Matthew Segal and Taye Shuayb for ATTN: took on additional executive producer roles. IMDb TV was later rebranded as Amazon Freevee. The eight-episode series was co-created by Tim Walsh, who also joined as an executive producer, and Elliot Wolf.\nEriq La Salle rounded out the executive production staff and directed episodes 1, 2, 5, and 6. The remaining episodes were directed by Brenna Malloy. Walsh, La Salle, Haas, Jankowski, and Malloy previously worked with Dick Wolf on various series in his Chicago, FBI, and Law & Order franchises. Writing on the program was temporarily halted in May 2023 during the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike; at this time, it was revealed that it would actually release on Amazon Prime Video instead. \nFilming for On Call took place on-location in the Southern California city of Long Beach, where the series is set, and was underway by May 2023. Recording mixed traditional television cameras with experimental found footage formats utilizing bodycams, dashcams, and cell phone cameras. All eight episodes were released on January 9, 2025. After the first season had concluded, Walsh stated that he was \"hopeful\" that there would be a second season and that \"some threads\" had been left open.\n\nCasting\nTroian Bellisario and Brandon Larracuente lead the series cast portraying Traci Harmon and Alex Diaz. Harmon is a seasoned training officer who is tasked with training Diaz, a new rookie. LaSalle also joined the series cast with Lori Loughlin and Rich Ting. They play the higher-ranking officer roles of Sergeant Lasman, Lieutenant Bishop, and Sergeant Koyama, respectively. It is Loughlin's first major television role following her involvement in the Varsity Blues scandal. The role of Bishop was originally offered to Michael Beach who accepted it, but was ultimately unable to take part in the series due to scheduling conflicts. Other actors were considered for the role before La Salle decided to take it up himself as he wanted the opportunity to act in, produce, and direct the same series.\nWhen a trailer for the series was released, it was revealed that Monica Raymund, who starred in Chicago Fire, would also appear in the premiere episode as Officer Maria Delgado. Delgado was killed off less than three minutes into the episode. Walsh explained this decision, stating that the series \"needed someone to fill that role, to cast that shadow\" and that \"we wanted people to believe it was a show about her, and it's not exactly what happens.\" Additional roles were filled by Mac Brandt, Lobo Sebastian, Robert Bailey Jr., Annabella Didion, and Ian Down.\n\nSoundtrack\nThe series score was composed by Atli Örvarsson, who also worked on the Chicago and FBI franchises. A digital soundtrack album titled On Call (Prime Video Original Series Soundtrack) was released by Lakeshore Records on January 10, 2025, and was accompanied by a single first released on YouTube one day prior.\n\nCancellation\nOn May 9, 2025, Prime Video canceled the series after one season. Amazon was initially interested in ordering two additional seasons of the program, but with a reduced licensing fee, under a cost-plus contract model that Wolf Entertainment and Universal Television could not afford. The series was pitched to other streaming platforms, with negotiations underway with two of them, one being Peacock, which houses other series of Dick Wolf's and is owned by NBCUniversal. Additionally, the possibility of turning On Call into a media franchise, with at least one spin-off series, was included in these discussions as well. If a new platform for the show is found, Amazon would allowe producers to regain control of the first season's streaming rights. Ultimately, no agreement was reached with either of these streamers, although conversations have continued elsewhere with chances for a renewal considered to be low. In June, Larracuente was cast in a main role on the fourteenth season of Chicago Fire.\n\nReception\nViewing figures\nWithin four days of the show's premiere date, it had been seen by 620,000 households, 26% of which were predominately Black households. A week after of the series' release, On Call ranked as the most-watched show on Prime Video in the United States. According to Nielsen ratings the series was the tenth most-watched original program across all streaming services for the week of January 20–26, 2025, with 297 million minutes viewed.\n\nCritical response\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 55% of 20 critics' reviews are positive. The website's consensus reads: \"On Call is an undemanding patrol thanks to its half-hour format, but the shorter runtime is about the only new novelty it brings to the cop drama genre.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 48 out of 100, based on 8 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews. The series received primarily mixed reviews.\nWriting a review for Comic Book Resources, Brittany Frederick opined that the program established itself by avoiding the overused elements typical for the genre and that the shorter runtime allowed it to avoid filler scenes. Jonathan Wilson from Ready Steady Cut described the series as \"a new kind of cop drama, blending serialized drama with a procedural, and while not all of it works, the result is mostly lean, mean entertainment.\"\nIsabella Soares with Collider praised the chemistry between Belisario and Larraccuente's characters, writing that it \"sets the tone for the show's more humane approach to the procedural.\" But Why Though critic Kate Sánchez penned a more mixed review and said the program \"lacks catharsis but attempts complexity\". She explained that the focus on patrol officers rather than detectives allows the audience to see more danger, but criticized the copaganda and portrayal of gangs. Sánchez concluded her review by adding that it \"doesn't reinvent the genre but it does thrive in it\", believing that a longer episode count would work better for the series.\nLooper's Ryder Alistair condemned On Call's format, saying that it was \"awkwardly divided\" between its overarching story and case of the week, stating \"the continuing storyline ensures it can't be enjoyed as an episodic cop show like its broadcast counterparts, and is too generic and reliant on cliché to hold interest by itself.\" Writing for the Chicago Tribune, Nina Metz wrote that the series was \"so intent on selling audiences on the idea that police are unfairly maligned and in danger every moment, of every day, that it forgets to tell a coherent or even fitfully entertaining story.\" Metz later criticized the practicality of the show, comparing the number of shootouts it had to those at the O.K. Corral.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website \nOn Call at IMDb",

In 1924 she divorced her first husband, Abraham Gutzeit, and opened a practice with her second husband, Fritz Brupbacher, in Zurich. Combining her work as a doctor with political activism, she fought for sexual liberation, contraception, the right to abortion, and the emancipation of women. She was banned from public speaking in 1937 for giving a lecture on birth control in Solothurn. \nIn September 1948, she published an article in La Révolution prolétarienne, \"La littérature russe d’aujourd’hui\" (\"Russian literature today\"), denouncing the servility of Russian writers towards the Stalinist regime.

    "text": "Wycliffe Well is an abandoned UFO tourist attraction consisting of a former roadhouse, petrol station, caravan park and restaurant on the Stuart Highway, 375 kilometres (233 mi) north of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory, Australia. Gaining interest in the site from the late 1980s onwards by UFO enthusiasts after a newspaper article, it went through two owners as a UFO tourist attraction, proclaiming itself as the \"UFO capital of Australia,\" before being bought by United Petroleum. It was then abandoned following a major flood in 2022.\n\nHistory\nWycliffe Well initially took its name from a water well built in 1875. The area was purchased in 1985 by former Royal Australian Navy sailor Lew Farkas as a small roadhouse store. Facing little competition for hundreds of kilometres, according to Farkas, the site grew to become a caravan park. The previous owners of the site contacted him about alleged UFO sightings, though Farkas stated this previous owner kept the sightings secret so as not to scare off prospective buyers.\n\nIn the late 1980s, a story in the Tennant Times newspaper about potential sightings at Wycliffe Well caused international interest in the site to grow, and Farkas shifted the marketing of his business to entirely revolve around aliens. He has stated that he spent about $4 million over 25 years to do so, also building a 300-seat Galaxy Auditorium restaurant and a nearby lake. Attractions included murals and souvenirs, a book ledger of so-called UFO sightings and night tours. After some time, the roadhouse began to call itself \"the UFO capital of Australia.\"\nA potential buyer of the premises was reported in 2008. In 2009 or 2010, Farkas sold the business to Anthony Vanderzalm, also known as Arc, who continued to collect alien paraphernalia for the premises including a prop alien corpse from the set of a Hollywood movie. Vanderzalm later sold it to United Petroleum. The company was largely interested in selling fuel at the station, and the UFO aspect of the location became less important. A Vice article in 2017 described the site as \"broken, faded, unloved.\" The Daily Telegraph reported in March 2019 that it had \"one of the best beer selections in the Northern Territory.\" By August 2019, three Indian-Australian entrepreneurs, Nikhilesh Jalla, Surya Mandarapu and Vamsi Koneru, were managing the property. In September 2021, an investigation into the site was made by the Liquor Commission after police found at least 30 people intoxicated and around 12 \"engaged in fist-fights\" that August. It found that the site had breached its liquor licence.\nA major flood event in 2022 forced the site's operators to evacuate the station. It became abandoned, and was vandalised after the water receded. Mastotermes darwiniensis termites began to quickly eat at the wood in the site's buildings including the Galaxy Auditorium restaurant. Tourism Central Australia CEO Danial Rochford stated in 2024 that he hoped the site would one day be restored, but that there was a lack of money for investment in the site.\n\nConspiracy theories\nTheories concerning the importance of the area to the alleged UFOs include the alignment of landforms, tectonic plates, and man-made structures. Another is that the US military intelligence base Pine Gap is nearby.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "Sunpadh Rebellion",
    "text": "The Rebellion of Sunpadh was a Zoroastrian uprising against the Abbasid Caliphate in retaliation for the execution of Abu Muslim al-Khorasani. The rebellion seemed clearly driven by Sunpadh's close connection to Abu Muslim, as he was one of his companions and supporters. He threatened in marching to Mecca and destroy the Kaaba. The rebellion ended up being suppressed by the Arab commander Jahwar ibn Marar al-Ijli. Approximately 30,000 to 60,000 of Sunpadh's followers killed with Sunpadh killed by Jahwar al-Ijli or murdered by the relative of the Dabuyid ruler, Ispahbad Khurshid.\n\nBackground and rebellion\nThe news of Abu Muslim al-Khurasani's execution led to disturbances to the people of Khurasan and the broader Persian population, from northeastern to western Iran many mourned his death, believing they had lost their savior and the most significant figure to emerge from their ranks since the Islamic conquest of Persia.\nIn early 755, with an aim to avenge the murder, Sunpadh, a nobleman from the village of Ahan or Ahrawanah in the district of Nishapur of Khorasan. Sunpadh was the chief of Nishapur, who rebelled against the Abbasid Caliphate. Later, Abu Muslim promoted Sunpadh to the rank of ispahsalar.\nSunpadh was first in Abu Muslim's army, which he had brought with him when he wanted to perform Hajj in the year 136 AH (753 CE or 754 CE). Abu Muslim had left a part of his army in Ray, along with some of his treasuries. Sunpadh maybe was in the army that encamped in Ray, or maybe Sunpadh remained residing in Nishapur.\n\nReligion of Sunpadh\nHistorians differed in their description of the faith of Sunpadh. al-Masudi considered him a Khurramite, while al-Tabari said that he was a Zoroastrian, while Nizam al-Mulk described him as a Mazdakite. According to the modern historian Farouk Omar: \"However, if we look closely at the slogans raised by Sunpadh, we notice his attempt to reconcile the principles of Ghali Islam, Khurramism, and Mazdakism. This indicates that Sunpadh spread his propaganda among Islamic and non-Islamic elements, and in order to include them in his movement, he raised different slogans that suited all these groups. For this reason, his slogans were political and religious at the same time. He called on the Khurramites to ally with the \"Ghulat \". In his opinion, there was no difference between the teachings of the Ghulat and the teachings of Mazdak. Nizam al-Mulk says that Sunpadh's teachings greatly influenced the Rafida (perhaps he meant the Ghulat Shiites) and the Followers of Mazdak.\" Sunpadh was identified as a Zoroastrian by the most of modern historians.\n\nBeginning of the rebellion\nThe rebellion erupted under Sunpadh's leadership, in Nishapur, driven by his personal allegiance to Abu Muslim, whose assassination served as the catalyst that triggered the rebellion. where Sunpadh propagated messianic beliefs concerning Abu Muslim's fate, asserting that his mentor's death was not final: Abu Muslim would return from the dead, accompanied by the Mahdi of the Rafidites and Mazdak, to guide us [Sunpadh's followers] to ultimate triumph.\nAnother motivation for Sunpadh's rebellion was his pursuit of restoring of the ancient Persian religion (Zoroastrianism) while simultaneously pursuing the expulsion of Arab forces from the Persian territories. His radical anti-Islamic agenda culminated in his bold declaration to destroy the Kaaba itself.\nThe movement gained vital assistance from the Dabuyid ruler, who was known as the ispahbadh of Tabaristan, Khurshid (r. 740–760), as Sunpadh sent a part of Abu Muslim's treasuries to him to support the anti-Abbasid rebellion. Ispahbadh Khurshid whose the domain remained minimally affected by Islamic influence and whose assistance proved essential for the rebellion's early momentum. Rural populations throughout Ray and its vicinity rallied to Sunpadh's movement. The movement attracted supporters from diverse regions including Tabaristan, Daylam, and Jibal. the rebels mostly composed of Khurramites, with rebel forces reportedly reaching between 90,000 and 100,000 participants. However, Historian Farouk Omar suggests these numerical estimates may have been exaggerated. Sunpadh's followers were mostly farmers and peasants.\nSunpadh managed to capture the cities of Nishapur, Ray. Sunpadh defeated and killed the governor of Qumis, Abu 'Ubaid al-Hanafi, and captured the city. He earned the title of \"Firuz Ispahbadh\" (\"the victorious Ispahbadh\"). Sunpadh dispatched correspondence to the Daylamite ruler, proclaiming his success in overthrowing Arab dominance in the region. At Ray, he took over the treasures and resources of Abu Muslim that had been left there when Abu Muslim had set out for his intended audience with the Abbasid caliph, al-Saffah, for Hajj in the year 130 AH (747 CE or 748 CE). After he successfully captured Ray, he planned to invade Iraq, he took a large number of Muslims captive, especially women, but he treated the merchants and the owners of the goods kindly, perhaps because he hoped that they would prepare provisions and food for his large number of soldiers.\n\nSuppression of rebellion\nAbbasid Response\nAs Sunpadh and his followers were moving toward Hamadan, the Abbasid caliph, al-Mansur, responded by dispatching a substantial military force under the command of Jahwar ibn Marrar al-Ijli. The expedition comprised approximately 10,000 troops, including Khorasani forces from Iraq, Arab contingents from western Iran, and additional units from Fars, Khuzistan, Isfahan, and Qom. The Ijli tribe, being the dominant Arab clan in the Jibal region, provided significant support to Jahwar's campaign. As so many Arabs from Jibal joined Jahwar's army under the lead of Omar ibn al-Alaa. Before the decisive engagement, Jahwar addressed his troops to motivate them for the impending battle, framing the conflict in religious and material terms:You will be fighting people bent on eliminating your religion and expelling you from your world of wealth and power. \nThe decisive confrontation occurred between Hamadhan and Ray at the desert's edge, a battle at Jurjunban. Despite initial resistance, Sunpadh's forces suffered a catastrophic defeat, with approximately 30,000 to 60,000 of his followers reportedly killed during the rout. The aftermath saw the capture of women and children among Sunpadh's supporters as prisoners of war.\nFollowing his military defeat, Sunpadh and his brother attempted to seek sanctuary in Tabaristan. The entire rebellion, from its inception to Sunpadh's death, lasted merely seventy days. According to the historian Ibn Isfandiyar, countless of Abu Muslim's and Sunpadh's supporters were killed in the defeat that their bones were still noticeable in 912.\n\nConflicting accounts of Sunpadh's death\nHistorical sources present divergent narratives regarding Sunpadh's demise, reflecting the complex political circumstances of his final days. While the ispahbad of Tabaristan initially welcomed Sunpadh by dispatching an official to receive him, this hospitality quickly soured as the local ruler feared that harboring the rebel would jeopardize his relations with the Abbasid Caliphate, leading him to orchestrate Sunpadh's assassination after a brief period. The precise circumstances vary among medieval historians: some sources claim Lunan al-Tabari killed Sunpadh in the territory between Tabaristan and Qumis,  while according to Nizam al-Mulk, Sunpadh was killed by Jahwar at Ray, and according to Ibn al-Athir, it was the Ispahbad's own agent who carried out the killing. Ibn Isfandiyar provides a notably different account, describing how Jahwar ibn Marrar defeated Sunpadh in battle, after which the rebel fled to Tabaristan with Abu Muslim's treasure, only to be killed by Tus, the ispahbad's cousin, during a quarrel. According to another tradition, both Sunpadh and his brother were slain by a relative of the Tabaristan ruler, who then sent their heads to Jahwar. It is possible, however, that the murder was instigated by the ruler of Tabaristan, Khurshid, in the hope of acquiring the remainder of Abu Muslim's treasure.\nA number of Sunpadh's followers continued to remain loyal to him until the fifth century AH (11th century CE) in Ray and Qazvin, where they were known as the \"Sunpadhiyya\".\n\nSee also\nKhurramites\nRawandiyya\nAbu Muslim\nBabak Khorramdin\nBabak Khorramdin Revolt\nMazdakism\n\nReferences\n\n\n== Sources ==",

    "title": "Brunswick Land",
    "text": "Brunswick Land (German: Braunschweiger Land) is a historical region in the Southeast of the German state of Lower Saxony, centred around the city of Braunschweig. It refers to the core territory of the historic Duchy of Brunswick and its successor, the Free State of Brunswick, which was disestablished in 1946.\n\nGeography\nThe area stretches from the Harz mountain range in the south along the Oker river down to the Burgdorf-Peine Geest in the North German Plain. The natural landscape includes the Elm, Asse and Salzgitter Hills, the Hainberg and Vorholz ranges in the west, as well as the Harly Forest. \n\nToday Brunswick Land roughly corresponds to the central parts of the former Lower Saxon Verwaltungsbezirk Braunschweig in its pre-1978 borders, including:\n\nthe independent cities of Braunschweig, Salzgitter, and Wolfsburg\nat least parts of the districts of Gifhorn, Goslar, Helmstedt, Peine, and Wolfenbüttel.\nThe district of Holzminden, part of the Free State of Brunswick until 1941, today belongs to the neighbouring South Lower Saxony region. Likewise, the eastern Brunswick exclaves of Calvörde and Blankenburg today are part of Saxony-Anhalt, while the northwestern exclave of Thedinghausen belongs to Verden district.\nOn that basis and excluding several unincorporated territories in the Harz mountains, the region has an area of 4,716.43 square kilometres (1,821.02 mi2) and a population of 1,115,876. The population density, at 237 people/km2, is higher than the Lower Saxon and the German average.\nAway from the main cities, the region encompasses large agricultural areas. The traffic infrastructure relies on numerous railway lines and controlled-access highways such as Bundesautobahn 2 and Bundesautobahn 39. The main employer in the region is Volkswagen headquartered in Wolfsburg.\nImportant educational facilities include the Braunschweig University of Technology, the Clausthal University of Technology, the Braunschweig University of Art, the Ostfalia University of Applied Sciences, as well as the Herzog August Library in Wolfenbüttel. Other institutions include the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt in Braunschweig, the Federal Office for Radiation Protection in Salzgitter, as well as Braunschweig locations of the German Aerospace Center, the Federal Research Centre for Cultivated Plants  (Julius-Kühn-Institut) and the Friedrich Loeffler Institute for Animal Health.\n\nRegional associations\nThe Brunswick Landscape Association (Verein Braunschweigische Landschaft) with its seat in Braunschweig was established in 1990. As a cultural-political organisation, it has set itself the aim of promoting the identity of Brunswick Land and ties between the populations and their history after the foundation of the state of Lower Saxony. The effective area covers the central territories around the cities of Braunschweig, Salzgitter and Wolfsburg as well as the adjacent districts of Helmstedt, Peine and Wolfenbüttel. The association uses a silhouette of the Saxon Steed as its emblem.\nThe cities and districts of the larger Braunschweig Region form the eastern part of the Hannover–Braunschweig–Göttingen–Wolfsburg Metropolitan Region. The associated regional authorities closely cooperate in matters of regional planning and public transport.\n\nLegends and traditions\nThe former Duchy of Brunswick arose in 1814 as successor of the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, which for centuries was ruled by the Welf descendants of Henry the Lion. He had received the Duchy of Saxony as an Imperial fief in 1142 and chose the City of Braunschweig as his residence. One of the most powerful German princes, he entered into a fierce conflict with the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick Barbarossa and finally was banned in 1180. He could only retain his allodial possessions around Brunswick and Lüneburg, the nucleus of the later Welf duchy.\nLike the tales that refer to Henry the Lion (as rendered by Agostino Steffani's opera Henrico Leone), the legends about the medieval trickster Till Eulenspiegel from Kneitlingen, Brunswick Mum beer, or the alleged foundation of Braunschweig and Dankwarderode Castle by the Brunonid brothers Brun and Dankward, are rich in tradition. The densely forested mountains of the Harz and Elm ranges are the setting of numerous myths and fables.\n\nCities and towns\nTowns in the Braunschweig Region (including present-day urban districts):\n\nSee also\nBraunschweiger Zeitung\n\nExternal links\nBrunswick region at Lower Saxony tourism\nExcursions in Brunswick Land with descriptions of numerous places and sights  (in German)\nBrunswick Landscape Association (in German)",

    "text": "Tiger Palpatja (c. 1920 - 16 April 2012) was an Australian Aboriginal artist from the Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands.\n\nLife\nTiger was born around 1920 (though the exact year is not known). He was born in the bush, at a rockhole called Piltati, which is close to what is now Nyapaṟi in north-west South Australia. His family were Pitjantjatjara, and they lived a traditional, nomadic life in the bushland around Piltati. When he was a teenager, Tiger's family settled at Ernabella, which at the time was a Presbyterian mission and a sheep station. Tiger grew up on the mission, and learned to speak a little English in school there. He eventually married Nyalapanytja, and they lived in Ernabella for many years. Tiger worked on the station, shearing sheep and building fences.\nIn the 1970s, Tiger and his family moved to Amaṯa, closer to his homeland. When he aged, Tiger became a ngangkaṟi (traditional healer), an important and respected role in traditional Pitjantjatjara communities. In 1997, the women at Amaṯa began a community art centre, originally called Minymaku Arts. The word minymaku means \"women's\", and they called it this because, at the time, Pitjantjatjara men did not like to paint. After several men began painting in the early 2000s, the centre's name was changed to Tjala Arts.\nTiger started painting in September 2004, less than eight years before his death. He had never painted before this, and was better known for woodworking, especially making spears. Although he only began painting in his final years, his work quickly became recognised by critics. In 2005, Tiger was a finalist for the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award. He became a finalist three more time before his death, in 2006, 2010, and 2011, but he never won. He was also a finalist in the Western Australian Indigenous Art Awards in 2009, and again in 2011. Tiger mainly painted for Tjala Arts, but from 2009 he also began working for Tjungu Palya in nearby Nyapaṟi.\n\nArtwork\nTiger's painted sacred stories from his Dreaming, mostly to do with Piltati, where he was born. This place is associated with a creation story involving two sisters and their husbands, who change themselves into Wanampi (a giant water snake). According to Tiger's Dreaming, the Wanampi are his family's ancestors who created the country around Piltati. The snake's form can be seen in many of Tiger's paintings, usually painted several different colours. His paintings were known for their bright colours, as opposed to the traditional natural ochre colours used by many other artists of the Western Desert.\nTiger died on 16 April 2012, over the age of 90. While he was alive, his paintings were exhibited in several major cities, including Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Fremantle and Perth. His work is now held in permanent galleries in most of these cities. He also had work exhibited overseas: at the University of Virginia in 2006, and in Singapore in 2008. His paintings are held in the National Gallery of Victoria, the National Gallery of Australia, the Australian National University, Charles Darwin University, Flinders University, and the Art Gallery of New South Wales.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nTiger Palpatja at Design & Art Australia Online",

    "title": "Oxyurini",
    "text": "The Oxyurini are a tribe of the duck subfamily of birds, the Anatinae. It has been subject of considerable debate about its validity and circumscription. Some taxonomic authorities place the group in its own subfamily, the Oxyurinae. Most of its members have long, stiff tail feathers which are erected when the bird is at rest, and relatively large, swollen bills. Though their relationships are still enigmatic, they appear to be closer to swans and true geese than to the typical ducks. The highest diversity is found in the warmer parts of the Americas, but at least one species occurs in a major part of the world.\nTheir habitus resembles a freshwater diving duck, particularly when moving on dry land. Their legs are set far back, making them awkward walkers, so they rarely leave the water. When at rest, their tails are a notable difference, and in the water they often swim very deep-set. Their unusual courtship displays involve drumming noises from inflatable throat sacs, head throwing, and erecting short crests. Most display singly with a very elaborate and peculiar display, but musk ducks congregate at leks and have a more limited display.\n\nSystematics\nOne mid-sized genus and two or three which are monotypic are described today:\n\nThe black-headed duck of Heteronetta is indisputably quite basal, looking more like a typical duck-like Anatidae with a short tail and normal bill.  The masked duck of Nomonyx has a more intermediate position; it probably diverged from the lineage leading to the main radiation some time after Heteronetta.\nThe musk ducks (Biziura), sometimes included in this group, are noted for their bizarre habitus and pronounced sexual dimorphism; they are of uncertain position and decidedly aberrant. Their anatomy is more similar to Oxyura than to the two less derived genera, but still unique in many respects. mtDNA cytochrome b sequence data suggest a closer relationship with the pink-eared ducks (Malacorhynchus) which if correct would represent one of the most drastic cases of divergent adaptation in the whole Anseriformes.\nAltogether, however, the only thing that seems clear is that the musk ducks probably are not part of the stiff-tailed ducks in the strict sense, but rather represent a not-too-distantly related lineage that is highly convergent as regards their hind limb anatomy. These two are probably part of a very ancient radiation of Gondwanan (often Australian) waterfowl, including such forms as the Cape Barren goose (Cereopsis), the coscoroba swan (Coscoroba), the freckled duck (Stictonetta) which once was placed in the Oxyurinae, or the pygmy geese (Nettapus), but the exact relationships between these lineages remains unresolved. For example, the African white-backed duck (Thalassornis) also shows some similarities to Oxyura, but again, this may be yet another case of convergent evolution.\n\"Anas\" luederitzensis from the Early Miocene of Namibia may be an early member of Oxyurini. Two Australian fossil genera of Oxyurini are Pinpanetta from the Oligocene and Tirarinetta from the Pliocene. Three enigmatic genera of waterfowl, Mionetta from the Late Oligocene to Middle Miocene of central Europe and Dunstanetta and Manuherikia from the Bathans Early/Middle Miocene of Otago, New Zealand, show some similarities to oxyurine ducks and judging from biogeography, the latter two may plausibly be related. However, Manuherikia and Mionetta are sometimes held to be Dendrocheninae adapted to diving, so closer to whistling ducks, a very ancient lineage of the Anatidae.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Oxyurini at Wikimedia Commons",

The head office is in Strasbourg. Its chief executive currently is Alain Ferstler.\nThe aims of the club include the maintenance and waymarking of just over 20,000 kilometres (12,427 mi) of footpaths and trails. The waymarks are put up by just over 760 volunteers (which averages out at approximately 26 kilometres (16 mi) per volunteer).\nThe club manages its own hostels and maintains refuge huts. In addition to promoting hiker tourism the Vosges Club is also dedicated to other outdoor activities like climbing and skiing, as well as nature conservation. The club publishes walking guides and maps, as well as its own magazine, Les Vosges, which comes out 3 times a year.\nThe Vosges Club is a founding member of the French Ramblers' Association (Fédération française de la randonnée pédestre) and the European Ramblers' Association.\n\nExternal links\nOfficial homepage",

She made her first on-screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 7 September 2011. On 21 February 2013, Gumede announced she was leaving the soap at the end of her current storyline. She departed on 3 April 2013, after which her character Kirsty was sent to prison. Gumede has won several awards for her portrayal of Kirsty. In June 2021, it was confirmed that Kirsty would be killed off off-screen.\n\nCasting\nCasting for Kirsty was announced on 8 July 2011 with Gumede winning the part. On being cast in the role Gumede said, \"From the moment I read the script, I knew I was going to love playing Kirsty and I can't wait to see how the story unfolds\" adding, \"This is a dream role for me and I'm looking forward to creating a huge storm in Weatherfield\". Gumede filmed her first scenes in early July.\nKirsty was introduced as a love interest for Tyrone Dobbs (Alan Halsall). While interviewed on This Morning series producer Phil Collinson said that Kirsty's arrival marked the start of a \"big storyline\" for Tyrone. He added that Tyrone's involvement with Kirsty would not be a \"smooth ride\".\n\nDevelopment\nDomestic violence storyline\nKirsty's character was seen to be manipulative and controlling, and a pregnancy storyline was written for the character with Kirsty and Tyrone discovering in January 2012 after splitting up with each other. After the character's controlling behaviour was seen on-screen, it was confirmed in March 2012 that Kirsty and Tyrone would become the centre of a domestic violence storyline; with The Sun reporting that Kirsty would \"begin psychologically abusing Tyrone, culminating in many vicious, violent attacks\".\nUpon hearing of the abuse storyline, Gumede and co-star Alan Halsall researched male domestic abuse charities such as ManKind - that support male victims of domestic violence, in order to portray the storyline as realistically as possible. She later told the Daily Record that \"there isn't much from the female abuser's point of view to read up on, it was really a case of thinking about it from the victim's point of view.\" She later said that she found it hard and \"draining\" to film scenes where she attacked co-star Halsall, and that although \"it was all camera tricks, the place I had to emotionally go to was quite ugly.\" After attacking Tyrone a second time, Kirsty attempts to leave him fearing that she is a danger to him.\nIn an interview with Digital Spy, Gumede explained that Kirsty's violence stemmed from her childhood. She revealed that \"Kirsty had an abusive childhood. Her father hit her on a regular basis up until her 18th birthday, when she left home. The inference is that she's had very little contact with her family since then.\" In June 2012, Gumede revealed that she was \"terrified\" at the prospect of filming scenes in which her character gave birth. She explained that \"artificial baby bump makes filming difficult, especially in the warm sunshine\" and that the upcoming scenes would provide a \"further challenge in her career.\" Gumede told the Anna Mansell from the Lancashire Telegraph that \"it has been really interesting how people have said they felt sorry for her\" and that \"viewers are intrigued to see what happens next as it’s a really complex story for a complex character.\"\nKirsty gave birth to a daughter, who she and Tyrone named Ruby. After bringing Ruby home, Kirsty struggles to cope with being a mother and when the baby does not stop crying, she trashes the kitchen. The neighbours are forced to alert Tyrone to the situation and he rushes to stop Kirsty. Peter Dyke and Katie Begley of the Daily Star reported that Tyrone considers running away with Ruby to protect her.\n\nDeparture\nOn 21 February 2013, Gumede announced that she would be leaving Coronation Street. Gumede stated that she had been touched by the support of the viewers, saying \"The last 18 months have been incredible, thank you all so much!\" The actress filmed her final scenes as Kirsty during the week commencing 25 February. She shot her scenes along with fellow departing actress, Shobna Gulati, who played Sunita Alahan.\n\nStorylines\nWhile on a night out, Tommy Duckworth (Chris Fountain) pays Kirsty to flirt with his friend, Tyrone Dobbs (Alan Halsall) who is single. Kirsty and Tyrone get on well and they exchange phone numbers. Tyrone later learns that Tommy paid Kirsty but she reveals that she is genuinely interested in him.\nWhen Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan) parks Rita Sullivan's (Barbara Knox) car across Kirsty's, they argue and Tina accuses Kirsty of scratching Rita's car. However, Kirsty denies it, telling Tina that she is a police officer but dislikes Tina and starts causing problems for her, including getting her accused of suspected shoplifting at a shopping centre and breaking a bottle of her perfume. She accidentally has Rita stopped for speeding but gets the ticket cancelled as she thought Tina would be driving. When Tyrone overhears Kirsty admitting to Tina that she set her up and threatening her, he ends the relationship. When Tina refuses to let her see Tyrone, Kirsty follows them in her police car as she is convinced they are secretly dating, but Tina sees her and is driving to the police station when they are involved in a minor accident and all three are taken to hospital. Kirsty then learns that she is pregnant. Tyrone decides to give Kirsty a second chance but Tina reports Kirsty for harassment but is persuaded to drop the case. Tina, determined to get her out of Tyrone's life, gets Tommy to follow her and when they see her meeting a man, they assume that Kirsty is cheating on Tyrone but are disappointed when Kirsty tells Tyrone that she was meeting her cousin about a present for him and is so disgusted by the accusation of infidelity that she then leaves. Tyrone goes to the police station and apologises before proposing and she accepts.\nKirsty threatens Tommy, warning him that no one will ever come between her and Tyrone and is not pleased when Tyrone lends Tommy some money, but agrees to help him investigate Terry Duckworth's (Nigel Pivaro) dealings with a local councillor. Tyrone and Kirsty go to the councillor's office, looking for evidence of corruption but get caught. The councillor is arrested for accepting bribes and Kirsty is sacked from the police force for breaking and entering so Tyrone gets her a job in packing at Underworld. Kirsty, however, is horrified and lashes out at Tyrone with a ladle. She apologises and Tyrone tells his friends that his injuries were accidental. Despite Kirsty insisting that she doesn't want any fuss for her birthday, Tyrone organises a surprise party and invites her parents. When her father learns she is pregnant and was sacked from the police force, he verbally attacks her and leaves, causing another argument between her and Tyrone. When he tries to walk away, she forces him up against a door. Tyrone walks out and when he returns, he finds Kirsty has packed a bag but Tyrone demands an explanation so Kirsty reveals that her father domestically abused her and her mother until she left home. Tyrone forgives Kirsty and she stays. Kirsty helps Tina when she and Tommy are hassled by Rick Neelan (Greg Wood), a loan shark. She uses her police connections to get Rick arrested and Tina thanks her.\nKirsty later suffers Braxton Hicks contractions in the cafe and panics when she can't get hold of Tyrone. When she learns that he was fixing Fiz Stape's (Jennie McAlpine) boiler, she gets jealous and they argue again. She destroys plates and a picture of Tyrone and Jack Duckworth (Bill Tarmey) but apologises, blaming her pregnancy hormones. When Tyrone and Fiz organise a baby shower and Tyrone tells Kirsty that Fiz helped him pick out items for the baby, she gets jealous again and insists that Tyrone has no further contact with Fiz. Her anger is sparked again when she learns that he has given Tommy a payment holiday so he and Tina can visit his grandmother in Blackpool. This causes another argument and she hits him again, using an accessory from a vacuum cleaner, leaving him badly bruised. This time, Tyrone asks Kirsty to see a doctor about her anger issues but she leaves just before the appointment but Deirdre Barlow (Anne Kirkbride) tells Tyrone this so they argue in the garden and angry, Tyrone pushes Kirsty away from him and she falls, cutting her head. Deirdre, having overheard the argument, asks Kirsty if she is okay and calls Dr. Matt Carter (Oliver Mellor), while Kirsty sends Tyrone to the pub so she can have a nap. When Tyrone returns, he finds Kirsty has packed her bags and she leaves, despite Tyrone asking her to stay. Tommy finds Kirsty at the hospital and asks her to come back, as Tyrone is suffering without her. Despite initially refusing, she returns a couple of days later and finds Tyrone talking to another woman while Dev chats to her friend. He asks her to stay and she agrees, angering Tina so she tells Tommy that Kirsty was abusing Tyrone and insists Tommy and Tina increase their repayments. She also causes problems by costing Tommy a security job and persuading Julie Carp (Katy Cavanagh) and Brian Packham (Peter Gunn) to buy Jason Grimshaw's (Ryan Thomas) flat, making Tina and Tommy homeless. They move into Owen Armstrong's (Ian Puleston-Davies) flat over the builder's yard.\nKirsty goes past her due date, but when Tina pushes her into a table during a fight in The Rovers, they realise she is in labour. Marcus Dent (Charlie Condou) and Gloria Price (Sue Johnston) deliver Kirsty's baby, who she names Ruby Dobbs (Grace Hanrahan/Macy Alabi). After bringing Ruby home, Kirsty struggles and when Ruby won't stop crying, she trashes the house. Tyrone tells her that he does not trust her with Ruby so he is pleased when Kirsty's mother, Alison Soames (Dawn Hope), visits, telling them that she has left Edwin Soames (David Lonsdale). Kirsty reluctantly allows Alison to stay and appreciates her help but Edwin arrives and snatches Ruby briefly to make Alison go home. Kirsty blames Tyrone for her father's reappearance and throws a candlestick at him so Tyrone ends the relationship is over and tells her to leave but insists that Ruby will stay with him. However, Kirsty tells him that he has no legal right to keep Ruby as his name is not on her birth certificate, forcing him to change his mind. Instead, they agree that he will stay at home to look after Ruby, while Kirsty goes back to work. However, Fiz knows about Kirsty's abuse and she notices the change in Fiz's attitude to her. Wanting Tyrone and Ruby to get out and meet people, she asks Katy Armstrong (Georgia May Foote) to take him to a mother and baby group, making Kirsty jealous again so she asks him not to go. When Fiz questions her about this, Kirsty is angered and in revenge, switches Fiz's sewing machine back on while she is trying to repair it, so she needs to go to hospital. Kirsty then takes charge of the first aid and takes Fiz to hospital so no one believes her when she insists Kirsty caused her injury.\nRealising she cannot trust Tyrone because of numerous texts from Fiz, Kirsty locks Tyrone in the house and takes his phone and keys with her. When Tyrone complains, she attacks him again but this time, shows no remorse and demands he apologize. Tyrone couldn't take any more, planning to run away with Ruby but Fiz and Tommy stop him and suggest he marry Kirsty so he will have parental responsibility. Tyrone and Kirsty make up and they begin planning the wedding. On Tyrone's birthday, Kirsty sees a card from Fiz and punishes him by slamming a door on his arm, injuring him. She apologizes again and they continue with the wedding plans but Kirsty becomes paranoid about Fiz and causes a fight by insulting her and her daughter, Hope. Shortly before the wedding, Kirsty finds Tyrone's secret phone that proves he and Fiz are now having an affair so she invites her to the wedding and during the ceremony, exposes the affair. Kirsty realises that Tyrone was only marrying her for custody of Ruby. At home, they argue on the stairs and when Kirsty tries to hit Tyrone, she loses her balance and falls. At the hospital, Kirsty tells the police that Tyrone has been hitting her for months so the police arrest Tyrone and Ruby goes into temporary foster care. However, he is released on bail. She suggests Tyrone come home and make a fresh start but he refuses, saying that he'll never forgive Kirsty for what she did so she tells Tyrone he can't see Ruby, leading him and Fiz to snatch her and run away. Kirsty is worried about her baby and reports her missing but Fiz knows they can't live on the run and calls the police so Tyrone is arrested. He is charged with assaulting Kirsty, much to her delight. Fiz tells Kirsty that the truth will come out.\nFiz and Tina find Alison and tells her what has happened but she refuses to believe them. When she confronts Kirsty, however, she admits it and promises to tell the police everything but changes her mind when she sees Alison leaving Tina's flat. In court, she stuck to her statement, much to Fiz and Alison's disgust. Alison offers to move in with her and help with Ruby, on condition that she tells the truth but Kirsty refuses, telling Alison that she is not welcome. However, the truth comes out when she finds Sally Webster (Sally Dynevor) looking after Ruby and angrily chucked her out, shouting at Julie for abandoning her and throws a cup at her. She immediately apologizes, blaming her stressful day. The next day, Ruby won't stop crying and Kirsty asks Dr. Carter for sleeping pills but storms out when he refuses. Julie, worried about what she saw, confronts Kirsty but she loses her temper and slaps Julie and gives her a bloody lip, so she runs out. Realising that now everyone will soon know the truth, she breaks down. When Ruby won't stop crying, she screams at her to shut up. Julie and Sean notice that Ruby has stopped crying and go to investigate, finding the house empty so Brian and Julie go to court but are told that Julie's complaint is not relevant to Tyrone's case and to go to the police if they want to make a formal complaint. Meanwhile, Kirsty and Ruby go into the courtroom and Kirsty admits that she is the monster, not Tyrone. Ruby was taken to social services, Tyrone ended up back in his cell and Kirsty was arrested. She admitted everything to the police and Tyrone was discharged from the court, and Ruby is returned to him. Kirsty sees Tyrone and Fiz walking away with her baby while she is taken to prison.\nThe next day, Kirsty wants to see Tyrone. He visits her and tells her not to contact him or Ruby ever again and that he's not scared of her anymore. Kirsty admits that she is the villain and says that she will get help, but Tyrone has heard it all before. He is sympathetic when Kirsty pours her heart out about changing her story for Ruby. Tyrone tells her that she'll always be Ruby's mother and that she'll always love her. Tyrone then leaves and Kirsty is escorted back to the prison cells.\nIn April 2014, Tyrone receives a call, saying that Kirsty has been released from prison. He later starts receiving anonymous text messages from an unknown person named \"K\". Tyrone believes that this is Kirsty but it is later revealed that the culprit was Maria Connor (Samia Longchambom), in a bid to try and reconcile her relationship with him. The police later reveal that the text messages came from within the United Kingdom, and that Kirsty no longer lives in the UK, but could not disclose her whereabouts for legal reasons.\nIn June 2021, Tyrone receives a visit from a police officer who informs him that Kirsty has died from an aneurysm. Unaware of how to feel, Tyrone visits Fiz to inform her of the news and they later inform Ruby that her biological mother has died.\n\nReception\nFor her portrayal of Kirsty, Gumede received the Best Newcomer accolade at The British Soap Awards 2012. She was later nominated for Best Soap Newcomer at the TVChoice Awards and Most Popular Newcomer at the 18th National Television Awards. Gumede won Best Bitch at the 2013 Inside Soap Awards.

    "title": "New Energy for America",
    "text": "New Energy for America was a plan led by President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden beginning in 2008 to invest in renewable energy sources, reduce reliance on foreign oil, address global warming issues, and create jobs for Americans. The main objective of the New Energy for America plan was to implement clean energy sources in the United States to switch from nonrenewable resources to renewable resources. The plan led by the Obama Administration aimed to implement short-term solutions to provide immediate relief from pain at the pump, and mid- to- long-term solutions to provide a New Energy for America plan. The goals of the clean energy plan hoped to: invest in renewable technologies that will boost domestic manufacturing and increase homegrown energy, invest in training for workers of clean technologies, strengthen the middle class, and help the economy.\n\nHistory\nThe term \"New Energy for America\" was first used on July 28, 2004, at an event in downtown Boston that gathered leaders from labor, government, business, and the environmental community to discuss how the \"new energy\" economy is critical for the future. This event raised awareness for the need for renewable energy and suggested that the new energy economy is about jobs, national security, public health, and the planet left behind for future generations.\nThe plan was presented by Barack Obama's presidential campaign in 2008.\nPresident Barack Obama, in his inaugural address called for the expanded use of renewable energy to meet the twin challenges of energy security and climate change.\nIn 2009, the Obama Administration made an effort to allow homeowners to finance solar and energy improvements without cost upfront, also known as PACE (Property-Assessed Clean Energy); They collaborated with the Middle Class Task Force to create a Policy Framework for PACE Financing Programs.\nObama issued a pair of memoranda on January 26, 2009, to publish higher fuel economy standards for the model year 2011 cars and light trucks by the end of March and lower greenhouse gas emissions (to revisit a California waiver request that would allow that state to implement its own greenhouse gas emission rules for vehicles).\nIn June 2014, the Clean Power Plan was proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to the Obama Administration. The plan hoped to fight global warming and was approved by President Obama on August 3, 2015.\nOn July 19, 2016, the Obama Administration announced a partnership between the Clean Energy Savings For All Initiative and the Departments of Energy (DOE), Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Agriculture (USDA), Health and Human Services (HHS), Veteran's Affairs (V.A.), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This plan hoped to increase access to solar energy and promote energy efficiency in low-to-moderate income communities.\n\nContent\nThe plan aimed to:\n\nHelp create five million new jobs by investing $150 billion over the next ten years to encourage private efforts to develop clean energy sources and technology.\nSave more oil than the United States currently imports from the Middle East and Venezuela combined within 10 years.\nPut 1 million plug-in hybrid cars on the road by 2015, with emphasis on cars built in the United States.\nGenerate 10 percent of the United States' electricity through renewable sources (renewable electricity) by 2012 and 25 percent by 2025.\nImplement a cap-and-trade program to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent by 2050.\n\nShort-term solutions\nThe New Energy for America plan offered three short-term solutions. These solutions were meant to help Americans through the immediate crisis when energy prices were high.\n\nThe first solution would be to provide emergency energy rebates. This would be achieved by requiring oil companies to take a share of their profits and provide relief worth $500 per individual and $1000 per couple to help families cope with the rising gas and electricity prices.\nThe second solution would be to enact legislation to prevent oil companies from unfairly raising prices.\nThe third solution would be to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Obama and Biden supported releasing oil from the reserve and replacing it with oil that would benefit Americans in the long term while lowering oil prices.\n\nMid- to long-term solutions\nThe New Energy for America plan offered six mid to long-term solutions. Taken together, these proposals would help resolve the issue of global climate change and ensure America became less dependent on foreign oil.\n\nDeal with climate change by implementing a cap-and-trade program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and developing a similar global program with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\nInvesting in a secure energy future,\n(1) by investing $150 billion over ten years to develop 5 million new green jobs,\n(2) by creating a new “Green Vet Initiative” that would help military veterans enter the new energy economy,\n(3) by converting manufacturing companies into centers that would help Americans learn skills related to producing new energy products, and\n(4) by directing funds to federal workplace training programs that would be centered on green technology, advanced manufacturing, and weatherization training.\nMake cars, trucks, and SUVs fuel-efficient by increasing fuel economy standards by 4% every year. There would also be a greater number of fuel-efficient vehicles by giving domestic automakers $4 billion retooling tax credits and loan guarantees. Congress and auto companies would work to ensure that all new vehicles have FFV capability of running on clean alternative fuel and to establish a national Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) that would introduce low-carbon non-petroleum fuels.\nPromote domestic energy supply by making oil companies drill in open areas on land they already have access to - or make them sell to another company that will. America would also prioritize constructing the Alaska Gas Pipeline and getting more oil from existing oil fields within the US.\nDiversify America's energy sources by\n(1) requiring 10% of electricity consumed in the US to come from clean energy sources by 2012,\n(2) developing and commercializing clean coal technology, and\n(3) securing nuclear power and making sure waste from reactor sites is contained.\nReduce energy use and costs by\n(1) implementing a program that would work to reduce electricity usage,\n(2) providing more resources to the Department of Energy so they stop missing deadlines that have cost Americans millions of dollars,\n(3) reducing federal energy consumption,\n(4) requiring states to conduct proceedings that implement incentive changes and offer assistance to utility companies,\n(5) investing in a Unified Smart Grid to better transmit and monitor energy, and lavishly funding LIHEAP so that it will give heating assistance to low-income families during the winter, and\n(6) investing in repairing roads and bridges while encouraging public transportation.\n\nImplementation\nThough the New Energy for America plan was never fully implemented as originally announced, many parts of the plan were implemented through various later-developed acts, plans, and executive orders throughout Barack Obama’s time as president.\n\nThe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009\nThe first pieces of the New Energy for America plan put into action were done so through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, that was introduced to combat the effects of the Great Recession of 2008 and signed into law by President Obama. The policies implemented included $90 billion towards government investments, and tax incentives that promoted job creation and laid a solid foundation for clean energy. An additional $150 billion was leveraged in private and other non-federal capital for clean energy investments, resulting in more significant solar and wind power usage.\nAlthough these plans have different names, parts of the Recovery Act sought to achieve the same goals as the New Energy for America plan. The U.S. Department of Energy invested the funds from the Recovery Act into six main categories, which included:\nIncreasing energy efficiency, by weatherizing and increasing energy usage efficiency in over 650,000 low-income family homes across the U.S.\nUpgrading the transportation system, with money invested into American companies to stimulate the growth of the electric car industry, and increasing the number of electric vehicle charging stations in the U.S. from fewer than 500 to over 18,000 by 2012.\nOver 20,000 projects renewable energy projects were funded through tax cuts or cash assistance for clean energy manufacturing and production led to a doubling of U.S. renewable energy by 2012.\nSmart grid infrastructure was advanced, by investing in a modernized grid and building a safe and secure nationwide electrical system that allows access to renewable energy sources and uses smart meters for consumers to manage their energy use better.\nDeeper innovative research, through funding high-risk, high reward key research through the ARPA-E program.\nCleaning up U.S. nuclear waste; the Office of Environmental Management used these funds to decrease the United States’ nuclear carbon footprint by 69% throughout the Recovery Act.\nIn September 2009, Barack Obama allowed the United States Environmental Protection Agency to move forward with rules that heavily regulate greenhouse gas emissions from hundreds of power plants and large industrial facilities.\n\nPresidential Climate Action Plan\nPresident Barack Obama adapted further climate goals from the original New Energy for America plan into the \nPresidential Climate Action Plan. The Climate Action Plan, last announced in June 2013, was a series of executive programs that included regulations to cut domestic carbon emissions, to prepare the U.S. for impending effects of climate change, and to work internationally to address climate change.\nPresident Donald Trump repealed Obama's Climate Action Plan on his first day of office, asserting the plan was harmful to the economy. \nPresident Joe Biden, rescinded the Trump plan on his first day of office, and restored the Presidential Climate Action Plan.\n\nRecorded Impact\nOn June 29, 2017, the center-left think tank Center for American Progress released a study on the changes in U.S. energy usage climate impact between 2008 and 2016. The study found:\n\nEnergy reliance on coal went down over 18%, changing the dominant source of U.S. electric supply from coal to natural gas.\nRenewable energy grew significantly Between 2008 and 2016, led by solar and wind power.\nThere was significant job creation from improvements in energy efficiency and clean energy production.\n\nSee also\nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Plan\nClean Air Act\nCorporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE)\nEnergy Independence and Security Act of 2007\nEnergy Policy of the Obama Administration\nUnited States energy independence\nInfrastructure Investment and Jobs Act\nInflation Reduction Act\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "Lamzdeliai (pipes) are traditional wind instruments in Lithuania. The instrument was popular during night herding, at young people's gatherings, and weddings. Lamzdeliai are used to play improvised herding melodies—raliavimai, ridovimai, and tirliavimai.  Herders calmed their animals with these melodies, or they imitated the sounds of nature and birds.  Other tunes played on the pipes were sutartines, songs, and contemporary dances (polka, waltz, mazurka, quadrille, and march).\nTraditional lamzdeliai are made of either bark or wood.  The bark pipe (zieves lamzdelis) is made in the springtime of a willow, aspen or pine sprout.  The bark is beaten on all sides, and twisted off of the wood.  The blowing end is closed off with a stopper made from the wood, with one side cut off.  At the place where the stopper ends, a whistle hole is cut into the bark, and one end of the hole is bent slightly inwards. Three to six finger holes are cut in the pipe.  Wooden pipes are made of ash or linden wood.  The bark is removed, and the instrument is hollowed out by burning, drilling or carving.  The blowing hole, whistle hole and finger holes are made in the same way as for the bark pipes.  Lamzdeliai are usually tuned to a diatonic major scale.  The timbre is soft and breathy, but when the instrument is blown too strongly, the sound becomes sharp and shrill.\n\nSee also\nfrula, Balkans\nduduk, Armenia and Turkey\n\nReferences\nSources\nLithuanian Roots: An Overview of Lithuanian Traditional Culture.

    "text": "Mohammed Jamil Abdelqader Ashar (Arabic: محمد جميل عبد القادر عشا) is a Saudi-born Jordanian doctor resident in the United Kingdom, who was a suspect arrested after the 2007 Glasgow Airport attack. He was falsely charged with conspiracy to murder and conspiracy to cause explosions, but on 16 December 2008 was found not guilty and acquitted on all charges.\n\nEarly life and medical career\nA Jordanian who was born in Saudi Arabia to a family originating from Palestine, Asha moved to Jordan with his family in 1991. He attended Jubilee School in Amman, a school for gifted children, where he is remembered as a dedicated student who was bookish and introverted. He won prizes for his Arabic poetry and met Queen Noor, King Hussein of Jordan's 4th wife, when she visited his school. In 1998, Asha received a 98.3% overall mark in his school's leaving exams and he later gained the 3rd highest mark Jordan's national medical entrance exam.\nAsha entered the University of Jordan's medical school and graduated with a medical degree in 2004. During his medical studies he used his talent for poetry to woo his future wife, Marwah Dana, a laboratory researcher. He married Marwah in 2004. In the same year, Asha competed against 500 medical students and won a place at University of Birmingham, studying neurology.\nAsha moved to the UK in 2005 with his wife, and undertook post-graduate training at the Prince Philip Hospital in Llanelli, Wales and the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital, Shropshire. Asha then moved to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, where he met Bilal Abdulla and Kafeel Ahmed. In 2007, Asha lived in the village of Chesterton with his wife and young son Anas, and worked as a junior neurosurgeon at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire in Stoke-on-Trent. Consultant neurosurgeon Rupert Price said he gave Asha the best reference he ever wrote and he believed that Asha was on-track to become one of Britain's top neurosurgeons.\n\nGlasgow Airport attack\nArrest\nOn 1 July 2007, the day after the attack on Glasgow Airport, Asha and his wife were arrested in a rolling roadblock on the M6 motorway in Cheshire. Asha explained to police that they were travelling to a jewellers, as he wished to buy an anniversary wedding ring for his wife. His wife was later released without charge and she returned to her family in Jordan. Following his arrest, he was suspended from his medical duties. On 20 July 2007, Asha became the fourth suspect to be charged, with conspiracy to murder and conspiracy to cause explosions, in relation to the attack. A month earlier, it is believed that he had been offered the only ST1 training post in neurosurgery available in the West Midlands, one of a handful available throughout the country in the British government's MTAS system for junior doctor selection.\n\nTrial and acquittal\nAt his trial, the jury was told that Asha lent his friend, Bilal Abdullah, £1,500. However, Asha insisted that he felt disturbed at Abdulla's growing fascination with Islamist terrorism, and that he disliked Kafeel Ahmed, the deceased conspirator. In a police interview, Asha described how he attempted to encourage Abdulla to 'settle down, concentrate on his career and abandon such silly thoughts'.\nOn 16 December 2008 Asha was found not guilty of conspiracy to murder and conspiracy to cause explosions, the jury accepted that he was clearly innocent and knew nothing of the plot that his colleagues, Bilal Abdulla and Kafeel Ahmed, had planned. The judge at his trial criticised the counter-terrorism police for twice interviewing Asha without a solicitor and in his summing up he told the jury, \"What this trial may have revealed to you, on this occasion, [is that] Mohammed Asha's rights were not fully respected.\" Footage played to the jury showed police officers swearing at and ridiculing Asha, and the prosecution also admitted that interviewing officers told Asha that they found new evidence regarding him which they knew to be untrue.\nFollowing his acquittal, Asha was transferred from Belmarsh category A high security prison into the custody of the UK Immigration Service, where he awaited deportation to his home of country of Jordan on the grounds that his presence in the UK was \"not conducive to the national good\". Asha contested deportation and in January 2009 he was released on bail after the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) concluded it was not in the public interest to prevent him from returning to work. On 7 August 2009 the UK Immigration Service dropped its attempt to have Asha deported and he applied for leave to remain.\n\nAftermath\nAsha returned to the NHS, which was covered by The Sun, leading to a libel case, resulting in an apology by the newspaper.\n\nSee also\n2007 UK terrorist incidents\nLotfi Raissi\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\"Car bombing suspect 'on the run',\" BBC website.\n\"Two more arrests in hunt for terror cell,\" Times Online.\n\"A Surgeon's Trajectory Takes an Unlikely Swerve\" New York Times.\n\"Fourth suspect charged over British car bombings\" Brisbane Times.",

    "text": "Various moot court awards are annually given in the Willem C. Vis International Commercial Arbitration Moot in Vienna as well as the Willem C. Vis (East) Moot in Hong Kong. The top prizes in Vienna are the Pieter Sanders Award (Best Claimant Memorandum), the Werner Melis Award (Best Respondent Memorandum), the Martin Domke Award (Best Oralist), and the Eric Bergsten Award (Winner of the Moot; known as Frédéric Eisemann Award until 2017). Honourable Mentions are also awarded for the best oralists, memoranda, and teams that qualified for the knockout stages in the oral phase.\nFor the competition in Hong Kong, the top prizes are the David Hunter Award (Best Claimant Memorandum; known as Eric Bergsten Award until 2017), the Fali Nariman Award (Best Respondent Memorandum), the Neil Kaplan Award (Best Oralist), and the Eric Bergsten Award (Winner of the Moot; known as David Hunter Award until 2017). Like the Vienna competition, Honourable Mentions are awarded for the best oralists, memoranda, and teams that qualified for the knockout stages in the oral phase. Up until 2016, a separate winner for the Asian Division was also declared.\nBetween 2020 and 2022, due to COVID-19, both Vis moots were conducted online. In-person hearings resumed for both moots in 2023.\n\nVis Moot in Vienna\nAwards for the best memoranda in Vienna\nHonourable Mentions are awarded for the best memoranda of the competition, and the Pieter Sanders Award is given for the Best Claimant Memorandum. During the first three Moots, the award was given for the Best Written Memoranda in support of the positions of Claimant and Respondent. Subsequently, the Werner Melis Award was introduced as a separate award for the Best Respondent Memorandum. Pieter Sanders was one of the founders of modern international commercial arbitration. He was one of the principal drafters of the New York Convention and the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. Professor Sanders was also founder of the Law Faculty of Erasmus University Rotterdam and co-founder of the  International Council for Commercial Arbitration as well as the Netherlands Arbitration Institute. The Werner Melis Award is named after an Honorary President of the International Arbitral Centre of the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber (Vienna) and Honorary Vice-president of the International Council for Commercial Arbitration.\n\nAward for the best individual oralist during the general rounds in Vienna\nHonourable Mentions are awarded for the best oralists of the competition; the Martin Domke Award is awarded to the Best Individual Oralist. Both types of award are for the general rounds, and not elimination rounds. To be eligible for either award, a participant must have argued at least once for the Claimant and once for the Respondent. The Martin Domke Award was named after a former adjunct professor of law at New York University and a well-known scholar of international arbitration. Professor Domke was also vice president of the American Arbitration Association for 25 years and served as editor-in-chief of the then Arbitration Journal (now the Dispute Resolution Journal). He also was the author of Commercial Arbitration, published in 1965, and The Law and Practice of Commercial Arbitration, published in 1968.\n\nAward for winner of the moot in Vienna\nPreviously the Frédéric Eisemann Award, the Eric Bergsten Award is awarded to the prevailing team in the championship round. The award is named after the founder of the moot. As the Vis has grown in the number of participating teams, the Vis has expanded from having originally only four teams advance into the elimination or knockout rounds to its current state where the top 64 of over 300 teams advance.  From 1994 to 1996, the top four teams advanced; from 1997 to 1999, the top eight teams advanced; from 2000 to 2002, the top 16 teams advanced; and from 2003 to 2007, the top 32 teams advanced. Each team that advances to the elimination rounds receives an award for Honorable Mention for Best Team Orals.\n\nVis Moot (East) in Hong Kong\nAwards for best memoranda in Hong Kong\nHonourable Mentions are also awarded for the best memoranda of the competition; the top memoranda receive separate prizes. Between 2004 and 2016, the Eric Bergsten Award was given for the Best Claimant's Memorandum in the Vis Moot (East) held in Hong Kong. It was renamed the David Hunter Award from 2017 onward. The Fali Nariman Award is given for the Best Respondent's Memorandum.\n\nAward for the best individual oralist during the general rounds in Hong Kong\nHonourable Mentions are awarded for the best oralists of the competition; the Neil Kaplan Award is given for the Best Oralist during the General Rounds in the Vis Moot (East) held in Hong Kong.\n\nAward for winner of the moot in Hong Kong\nThe David Hunter Award was awarded to the team prevailing in the oral rounds in Hong Kong between 2004 and 2016. From 2017 onward, it was renamed the Eric Bergsten Award. Honourable Mentions are also awarded to teams that reach the knockout stages. Up until 2016, a separate winner for the Asian Division was also declared; a selection of the highest-ranking Asian teams that failed to qualify for the knockout stages would compete within a pool in a round-robin format. This prize was removed due to the rising performances of Asian teams.\n\nNote: due to an alleged glitch in the scoring, teams that did not advance to Round of 32 were permitted to advance directly to the semi-final round without going through the Round of 32, Round of 16, and quarterfinal.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nWillem C.

    "title": "Hudson's black tyrant",
    "text": "Hudson's black tyrant (Knipolegus hudsoni) is a species of bird in the family Tyrannidae, the tyrant flycatchers. It is found in Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, and as a vagrant to Brazil and Peru.\n\nTaxonomy and systematics\nHudson's black tyrant was formally described by Philip Sclater in 1872 as Cnipolegus hudsoni. Sclater gave it the specific epithet hudsoni to honor Argentine-British ornithologist William Henry Hudson, who collected the first four specimens.  The genus' spelling was later changed to Knipolegus. For a time the species was moved to genus Phaeotriccus but a 2012 publication confirmed its return to Knipolegus.\nHudson's black tyrant is monotypic.\n\nDescription\nHudson's black tyrant is about 15 to 15.5 cm (5.9 to 6.1 in) long. Adult males are almost entirely shiny black. Their wings have a wide white band on the inner webs of the primaries that is very conspicuous in flight but usually hidden when perched. They also has some whitish on the lower flanks. Adult females have a mostly grayish brown head and upperparts with a rufous rump and basal half of the tail. The rest of the tail is grayish brown with a blackish band across the end. Their wings are dusky with buff tips on the coverts that show as two wing bars. Their underparts are mostly buffy to ochre with dusky-olive streaks on the breast that extend more lightly onto the belly. Both sexes have a red iris, a blue-gray bill with a black tip, and black legs and feet.\n\nDistribution and habitat\nHudson's black tyrant is found from northern Bolivia south through western Paraguay into Argentina as far south as eastern Neuquén, northern Río Negro, and southwestern Buenos Aires provinces. It has also occurred as a vagrant in Brazil and Peru. The species inhabits somewhat open woodland and scrubland; in the north it also inhabits Gran Chaco woodlands, shrubby pastures, and gardens. In elevation it is found mostly below 500 m (1,600 ft).\n\nBehavior\nMovement\nHudson's black tyrant is a complete migrant. It breeds from central Argentina south and moves north for the austral winter to northern Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia.\n\nFeeding\nHudson's black tyrant feeds on insects. It usually forages in dense cover near the ground. Nothing else is known about its foraging behavior and diet.\n\nBreeding\nThe breeding season of Hudson's black tyrant has not been defined. Males make a display in which they jump among the branches of a dead tree and sometimes flutter up from there. The species' nest is an open cup that is usually in a small tree or bush. Nothing else is known about its breeding biology.\n\nVocal and non-vocal sounds\nHudson's black tyrant makes an \"[i]rregular ric-tic-titireetic and snapping sounds\".\n\nStatus\nThe IUCN has assessed Hudson's black tyrant as being of Least Concern. It has a large range; its population size is not known and is believed to be stable. No immediate threats have been identified. It is considered rare to locally uncommon though fairly common to common during the breeding season in south-central Argentina's Lihué Calel National Park.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back",
    "text": "\"1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back\" (stylized in all lowercase) is a song written and recorded by American singer-songwriter Olivia Rodrigo. It is the 4th track on her debut studio album, Sour, which was released on May 21, 2021, via Geffen Records. Dan Nigro produced the song. Taylor Swift and Jack Antonoff also received songwriting credits for its interpolation of Swift's 2017 song \"New Year's Day\".\nThe song's lyrics describe the harmful effects of inconsistent communication on a romantic relationship. Musically, \"1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back\" is a tender downtempo ballad driven by a damp piano and subtle bass. Upon Sour's release, \"1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back\" received positive comments from music critics, who complimented its simplistic instrumentation and vulnerable lyrics. Commercially, the song reached the top 20 in Australia, Canada, Singapore, and the United States, and the top 30 in New Zealand and Portugal.\n\nBackground and release\nWe interpolated \"New Year's Day,\" which is Taylor's song from Reputation. I came up with the \"1 step forward\" concept and I sort of wrote a verse and a chorus, and when I got home — I was in the car on a road trip, and when I got home, I decided to sing it over the chords of \"New Year's Day.\" I think they're really beautiful chords. I was lucky enough to get that approved, and it's on the record now.\nFollowing the viral success of her debut single \"Drivers License\", on April 13, 2021, Rodrigo announced the title, track listing and cover artwork of her debut studio album, Sour; the fourth track was titled \"1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back\". On May 20, 2021, the personnel involved in the album were revealed on digital music platforms, in which Taylor Swift and Jack Antonoff were credited as songwriters on \"1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back\". Rolling Stone reported that the song interpolates Swift's 2017 song \"New Year's Day\", which was written by Swift and Antonoff. Rodrigo has cited Swift as her biggest music inspiration and one of the core influences on Sour. The album was released on May 21, 2021, via retail stores, digital music and streaming platforms, as well as on Rodrigo's website.\n\nComposition and recording\n\"1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back\" details the impact of inconsistent and unhealthy communication on a relationship, and the subject's mixed responses via text messages. It is a ballad led by a dampened piano with a descending chord progression. The song interpolates the piano chords from Swift's \"New Year's Day\", the final track of her sixth studio album, Reputation (2017). Rodrigo stated that she had the verse and chorus of \"1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back\", and decided to play it over the chords of \"New Year's Day\", which she thought were \"beautiful\". The song is set in the key of D major with a slow tempo of 56 beats per minute. Rodrigo's vocals span from A3 to B4. She created the song's hook from a text message, stating that she \"thought it would be a cool way to describe this toxic, sort of manipulative relationship\". The bird chirping heard at the beginning of the track was an idea by Dan Nigro, the song's producer and Rodrigo's musical collaborator on Sour, who recorded them through a window at his house. The song's title is inspired by the phrase \"1 steps forward and 2 steps back\", but replaces the 2 with 3, which has been associated with Swift's lucky number 13.\n\nCritical reception\nMaura Johnston of Entertainment Weekly called the song a \"regret-wracked\" tune. The A.V. Club critic Tatiana Tenreyro wrote that \"1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back\" blends Swift's influences with that of Regina Spektor, \"inviting listeners who may have mourned failed romances while listening to Begin To Hope to feel nostalgic, while also allowing a new generation of teenagers to recognize themselves\". Tenreyro added that the track \"seamlessly transitions\" into \"Deja Vu\", the succeeding track on Sour. NME's Rhian Daly said that \"1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back\" is a \"perfectly fine song\" but leaves \"little impression\" due to its location between Rodrigo's familiar singles \"Drivers License\" and \"Deja Vu\".\nWriting for The New York Times, Jon Caramanica asserted that the song, like its fellow tracks, perfects \"the precise language for an imprecise, complex emotional situation; and working through private stories in public fashion.\" Pitchfork's Olivia Horn identified the song's \"Swiftian\" songwriting, in which Rodrigo \"treats emotional turmoil like jet fuel, and laces her lyrics with specifics\". Horn labelled it \"dewy-eyed soft balladry à la Ingrid Michaelson\". Chris DeVille, reviewing for Stereogum, said that \"1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Forward\" depicts \"the strength of Rodrigo's conviction and her ability to condense universal frustrations into soundbites.\" Billboard writer Larisha Paul lauded the song's mature and confessional lyricism.\n\nCommercial performance\nFollowing the release of Sour, all of the album's 11 tracks debuted on the Billboard Global 200, U.S. Hot 100, Canadian Hot 100, and Australian Singles charts, simultaneously. \"1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back\" entered the Global 200 at number 17. It landed at numbers 17, 18 and 19 in Canada, Australia, and the United States, respectively. The song also reached numbers 26 and 28 in New Zealand and Portugal, respectively.\n\nCredits and personnel\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of Sour.\nRecording\n\nRecorded at Amusement Studios (Los Angeles)\nMixed at SOTA Studios (Los Angeles)\nMastered at Sterling Sound (New York City)\nPersonnel\n\nCharts\nCertifications\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "Victor Forsythe",
    "text": "Victor Clyde Forsythe, also known as Clyde or Vic Forsythe (August 24, 1885 – May 24, 1962), was an American artist, most known for his illustrations and desert paintings. He is the illustrator of many different comics, including Joe Jinks. He is also believed to be considered one of the original \"Desert Painters\".\n\nPersonal life\nClyde Forsythe was born on August 24, 1885, in Orange, California, to W.B. and Alice Chandler-Forsythe. Prior to his birth, Clyde's parents had lived in Tombstone, Arizona, where they owned a store near the O.K. Corral, known as \"Chandler & Forsythe's C.O.D. Store\". According to Clyde's father, both W.B. and Clyde's uncle, Ira Chandler, were present at the time of the shootout that occurred between Wyatt Earp and his men and the Clanton-McLowery gang. Clyde's parents would eventually move to Southern California but this event would later influence Clyde's work.\nIn the 1890s, his family moved to Los Angeles, California. While living in California, Clyde would often take camping trips out to the desert and spent his time as a youth on a ranch in the Coachella Valley which would inspire his fascination with the desert landscape.\nIn terms of his training, Forsythe spent his youth training at the Los Angeles School of Art & Design under the direction of Louise Garden MacLeod. In 1904, Forsythe left Los Angeles and traveled to New York to study at the Art Students League, under the tutelage of Frank DuMond. While in New York, Forsythe was hired as an illustrator for the New York World. On June 12, 1906, Clyde married Cotta Owen. Together the couple lived in the well known artist colony of New Rochelle, New York. While living in New Rochelle, Forsythe met a young artist by the name of Norman Rockwell. Forsythe and Rockwell would become good friends and even shared a studio together in New Rochelle, which had previously been owned by the artist Frederic Remington.\nIn 1920, Clyde and Cotta moved out to California where he remained for the remainder of his life. Clyde died on May 24, 1962, in Pasadena, California.\n\nCareer\nForsythe's career began when he moved to New York and found work at the New York World. Here he illustrated various articles and comics, such as The Great White Dope, a comic about boxing, and a western comic called Tenderfoot Tim. Due to his early success, Forsythe began to catch the eye of William Randolph Hearst. Hearst was the publisher of New York World's rival magazine, the New York Journal and recruited Forsythe to work as a cartoonist. Here, Forsythe met fellow painter and cartoonist, Jimmy Swinnerton, with whom he became close friends with. He also met Norman Rockwell in 1914.\nDuring World War I, Forsythe was recruited by the Committee on Public Information's Division of Pictorial Publicity, for whom he created a number of war propaganda posters, including his famous \"And They Thought We Couldn't Fight\" poster. This poster, which was created for the Victory Loan drive, features an American soldier, with a bandaged head, celebrating his victory over the Germans and carrying a German helmet as a souvenir. This poster was thought to be intended to silence the Germans who claimed that the American soldiers were weak.\n\n. Forsythe was also responsible for various illustrations to war stories found in Boys' Life magazine throughout World War I and into the 1920s.\nAfter World War I, Forsythe continued to work as a cartoonist. In 1918, he created his most famous cartoon, Joe's Car (later distributed by United Feature Syndicate), which was a comic about a man obsessed with his car. Joe was depicted as a balding, agitated, everyman with an overbearing wife which made the cartoon relatable to the public and made Forsythe successful. In 1928, Forsythe renamed the cartoon from Joe's Car to Joe Jinks, the name of the character. This was done since Joe had gone from being a car-obsessed man to an airplane pilot as well as a boxing manager. Even though Forsythe moved out to California in 1920, he continued to create the Joe Jinks comics until 1933 when he quit. But after pressure from the public to return, Forsythe started creating the Joe Jinks comic again in 1937. This did not last long as he officially retired from the comic the following year in 1938.\nAfter moving out to California in 1920, Clyde continued to work on his art. He moved out to Alhambra, California, where he set up a studio with his friend and fellow artist Frank Tenney Johnson. In 1923, Forsythe and Johnson helped found a cooperative gallery in downtown Los Angeles, known as the Biltmore Salon, also known as the Biltmore Art Gallery. The art gallery was located at the Biltmore hotel and was designed as a place for artists to showcase their work. While he lived in California, Forsythe began to focus more on desert paintings. These paintings were focused on the desert landscape and features scenes of prospectors and burros, as well as a focus on the sky.\nAfter quitting comics in 1938, Forsythe focused his attention on easel painting. Forsythe is often considered one of the fathers of \"Desert Painting\" along with Maynard Dixon and Jimmy Swinnerton. Forsythe often painted in groups in the desert with these fellow artists. These artist are believed to have influenced a large number of \"Desert Painters\" and helped influence the desert painting movement.\nIn 1952, he painted Gunfight at O.K. Corral. The 43 by 60 inches (110 by 150 cm) oil painting was regarded by some as the most accurate depiction of the gunfight for many years. Forsythe's father, William Bowen Forsyth  and uncle, Ira Chandler owned a store, Chandler & Forsyth C.O.D., at 328 Fremont Street, west of the back entrance to the O.K. Corral, and one-half block from the site of the gunfight. They claimed that had been present and witnessed the shoot out. Newspaper accounts of the painting reported that Forsythe had interviewed Tombstone residents and examined many of the remaining buildings before beginning to plan his painting. In May 1988, his studio printed and sold a limited edition of 390 copies of the painting.\n\nComic strip bibliography\nBibliography of Forsythe's comic strip work:\n\nFlooey and Axel (aka Axel The White Dope), daily: April 22, 1911 - March 17, 1917\nBad Bill the Western Wildcat, weekdays: Nov 10 - Nov 29, 1911\nBaseball Games in Moving Pictures, weekdays: April 12 - June 5, 1912\nTenderfoot Tim, Sunday: Oct 20, 1912 - March 15, 1914\nIt Can't Be Done, weekdays: Nov 25, 1912 - Dec 30, 1913\nThe Commuters' Saturday Night, weekly: Dec 6-20, 1913\nI'm Falling in Love With Some One!, weekdays: Jan 7 - Feb 7, 1914\nVic Forsythe Comic Strip, daily: March 19 - June 2, 1917\nJoe Jinks (aka Joe's Car), daily/Sunday: June 4, 1917 - Feb 20, 1938\nHenry, Sunday: June 13, 1920 - Feb 6, 1921\nFussy Foursome, weekly panel: 1924 - April 26, 1931\nWay Out West, Sunday: Jan 7, 1934 - Nov 22, 1936\nJimmy and the Tiger, daily: Nov 12, 1934 - Dec 5, 1936\nJoe Jinks had a number of Sunday topper strips:\n\nJoe's Day Off: Dec 9, 1928 - March 10, 1929\nThis An' That: March 17, 1929 - March 2, 1930\nBozo's Diary: May 19, 1929 - Sept 28, 1930\nIt Seems That: March 16, 1930 - Jan 4, 1931\nDivot Diggers: June 28, 1931 - 1941\nFussy Foursome: Nov 6, 1932 - Dec, 1933\nWay Out West also had a Sunday topper: \n\nBunker Bugs: Jan 7, 1934 - April 7, 1935\nThe Little Woman: April 21, 1935 - Nov 22, 1936\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "Hong Kong Cemetery",
    "text": "Hong Kong Cemetery, formerly Hong Kong (Happy Valley) Cemetery and before that Hong Kong Colonial Cemetery, is one of the early Christian cemeteries in Hong Kong dating to its colonial era beginning in 1845. It is located beside the racecourse at Happy Valley, along with the Jewish Cemetery, Hindu Cemetery, Parsee Cemetery, St. Michael's Catholic Cemetery and the Muslim Cemetery.\nHong Kong Cemetery is a public cemetery managed by the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department. Hong Kong Cemetery contains 79 scattered Commonwealth burials of the First World War and 62 from the Second World War, which are maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.\nThe Protestant Cemetery is built as a series of terraces ascending a hillside. The older graves tend to be at the bottom of the hill; those from the 1930s and 1940s are generally at the top.\nOn a number of occasions, remains in the Protestant Cemetery have been disinterred to make way for road developments, and have been placed in niches in an ossuary, which continues to be used for contemporary cremations. The niches provide basic information on each individual.\n\nTypes of graves\nSome sections of the Protestant Cemetery tended to be reserved for particular groups of deceased, e.g., army, navy, Hong Kong Police. There are two main categories of graves that can be found in Hong Kong Cemetery:\n\nMilitary graves\nAs the name states, this category of graves for British military dead, spanned from the late 19th century until the early 1960s (when the Government of Hong Kong established another cemetery near Sai Wan for military dead in 1965). At the beginning of the colonial era, the British garrison force had the same problem as those in India: weather. Some of the members of the force could not adapt to the tropical weather of Hong Kong and died owing to tropical disease, while others fell during the Boxer Rebellion – mainly in 1900. At the time being, it is the major cemetery for military dead along with Stanley Military Cemetery.\nThere are about 100 military graves of World War I – 79 of them are in Hong Kong Cemetery, mainly the soldiers who died in Hong Kong and Kowloon Military Hospital, which received the sick and wounded from the German-leased territory of Qingdao, on the Shandong peninsula in north-east China. Evidence shows that most of them are naval personnel.\n\nBefore the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong in 1941, Britain had sent two battalions from the Royal Scots and Middlesex Regiments to Hong Kong for garrison duty. This cemetery provides evidence of the presence of these two battalions. There are in all 62 military graves of World War II Commonwealth service personnel – mainly from the year 1941 – maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.\nThe British force in Hong Kong used the cemetery as their burial ground until 1965. One notable military burial is Driver Joseph Hughes, a recipient of the George Cross.\nThere are also two monuments erected by the Royal Artillery in memory of their fallen comrades, which were later moved to the Hong Kong Museum of Coastal Defence.\n\nCivilian graves\nThe civilian burials in the cemetery are diverse and exemplify the social structure at the early stage of the colonial era. It is widely understood that the cemetery is for the burial of the privileged group of the society, mostly British. Notable people of that era buried in the cemetery include Sir Robert Ho Tung and his first wife, Sir Paul Chater and Sir Kai Ho. Most Christian missionaries to Hong Kong are also buried here, a notable example being Karl Friedrich August Gützlaff, a German missionary who helped to establish Lutheran churches in Hong Kong, who is considered the first Lutheran missionary to China. Another notable missionary interred here is Henrietta Hall Shuck, the first American female missionary to China.\nThere are also a number of Chinese burials, all of them Christians, some of them were involved in the late Qing revolution and uprisings led by Sun Yat-sen, including Yeung Ku-wan, who was assassinated by the Qing Government in Hong Kong.\nA number of Japanese were buried in the cemetery, mostly those who resided in Hong Kong during the early colonial era. Some of them were Christian, but most were followers of Shinto. The Japanese custom of burning incense during memorial rites led to complaints from some Westerners. As a result, a special Japanese section of the graveyard was designated.\n\nBurials\nNotable burials at Hong Kong Cemetery include:\n\nHenry Fletcher Hance (1827–1886), British diplomat and botanist\nWalter Fong (1866-1906), Chinese-American educator and founder of the first technical college in Hong Kong\nProf Robert Kirk FRSE (1905–1962), Scottish pathologist and parasitologist\nWong Tape (1875–1967), Chinese merchant in Dunedin, New Zealand and member of the Urban Council, Hong Kong\nSamuel Cornell Plant (1866–1921), first to command a merchant steamer plying on the Upper Yangtze River, First Senior River Inspector for Upper Yangtze\nJosephine Bracken (August 9, 1876 – March 14, 1902) was the common-law wife of Philippine nationalist José Rizal.\n\nIn popular culture\nA scene in John le Carré's novel The Honourable Schoolboy takes place in the nearby racetrack as well as the cemetery.\nThe cemetery is a popular place for filming movies and TV shows. The UK folk artist Johnny Flynn released a song in 2008 about the cemetery, found on the album A Larum.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nList of cemeteries in Hong Kong\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nLim, Patricia (2011).

    "title": "Jerry Hairston Jr.",
    "text": "Jerry Wayne Hairston Jr. (born May 29, 1976) is an American former professional baseball infielder and outfielder. He played 16 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Baltimore Orioles, Chicago Cubs, Texas Rangers, Cincinnati Reds, New York Yankees, San Diego Padres, Washington Nationals, Milwaukee Brewers, and Los Angeles Dodgers. He played every position except pitcher and catcher during his baseball career. He is the grandson of former major leaguer Sam Hairston, the son of former major leaguer Jerry Hairston Sr., and the brother of Scott Hairston.\n\nEarly life and college\nHairston attended Naperville North High School in Illinois, and was a two-time All-State selection in baseball and an all-area selection in basketball. He was drafted in the 42nd round of the 1995 Major League Baseball draft by the Baltimore Orioles but chose instead to go to college.\nHairston played college ball at Southern Illinois University in 1996 and 1997, where he batted .360 for his career and was the Missouri Valley Conference Freshman of the Year in 1996. In both years he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League, playing for the Bourne Braves in 1996, and the Wareham Gatemen in 1997. In 2009, he was inducted as a member of the Saluki Hall of Fame.\n\nProfessional career\nBaltimore Orioles\nHairston was drafted in the 11th round of the 1997 Major League Baseball draft by the Baltimore Orioles. He made his professional debut as a shortstop in 1997 with the rookie-league Bluefield Orioles, where he hit .330 in 59 games. In 1998, he made a fast rise up the farm system and moved to second base. Starting in High-A with the Frederick Keys, he hit .302 in 80 games. He was promoted to the AA Bowie Baysox, where he hit .326 in 55 games. He was promoted to the majors and made his major league debut with the Orioles on September 11, 1998, against the Anaheim Angels. He appeared in seven games that year, serving primarily as a pinch runner or late-inning defensive replacement.\nHe began the 1999 season in Triple-A with the Rochester Red Wings, before being called up in June to replace the injured Delino DeShields at second base. Hairston hit .277 with two home runs and seven RBI in 25 games before returning to the minors. He got his first hit on June 27 off of New York Yankees pitcher Orlando Hernández and his first home run on July 1 off of Joey Hamilton of the Toronto Blue Jays. Hairston was called up again in September, hitting .269 with four home runs, nine stolen bases, and 17 RBI in 50 games on the season. The Orioles planned to make Hairston the everyday second baseman for the 2000 season, but a shoulder injury that required surgery in May changed their plans. He was finally called up on August 12, hitting .250 with five home runs and 19 RBI in 49 games as an everyday player.\nIn 2001, Hairston was the Orioles starting second baseman. He hit .233 with eight home runs, 29 stolen bases, and 47 RBI in 159 games that year. His flashy style of play drew criticism from inside the organization and from rivals, including the Yankees. The Orioles made Hairston the leadoff hitter heading into the 2002 season. However, his patience at the plate did not improve as much as the organization had hoped and second base prospect Brian Roberts was promoted on May 22. The two shared playing time until Roberts was sent back down in July. In total, Hairston hit .268 with five home runs, 32 RBI, and 21 stolen bases in 122 games that year.\nHe began the 2003 season on a hot streak, hitting .287 with two home runs, 16 RBI, and a league-leading 14 stolen bases through 42 games. Then, on May 20, he caught his foot on the edge of home plate while batting and broke his foot. The injury required surgery to fix, and Hairston was out of action until September. In his place, Robert hit .270 with five home runs, 41 RBI, and 23 stolen bases in 112 games.\nIn 2004, Hairston broke his finger sliding into third base during the first inning of the Orioles' first spring training game, ending the competition for the second base job prematurely. When Hairston returned in May, he was made the team's DH while Roberts remained at second. He managed to hit .303 and also played all three outfield positions until a broken ankle ended his season in mid-August.\n\nChicago Cubs\nIn January 2005 Hairston was traded (along with Oriole prospects Mike Fontenot and David Crouthers) to the Chicago Cubs for Sammy Sosa. He played all three outfield positions and split time at second base with Todd Walker and Neifi Perez. The Cubs attempted to use Hairston as a leadoff man, but he finished the 2005 season with an unremarkable .336 on-base percentage and stole only eight bases in 17 attempts. On July 15, he hit his first career grand slam in an 11–1 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates. On August 31, Derek Lowe of the Los Angeles Dodgers pitched a one-hitter against the Cubs; Hairston's first inning infield hit was Chicago's only hit. In 2006, he hit .207 in 38 games, playing mostly at second base.\n\nTexas Rangers\nOn May 31, 2006, Hairston was traded to the Texas Rangers for Phil Nevin. He hit .205 in 63 games as both a starter and late-inning defensive replacement, and was designated for assignment after the season. The Rangers re-signed him to a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training before the 2007 season. Hairston won a spot on the opening day roster, as a reserve outfielder and utility player. He missed time in May due to a pinched nerve in his neck and in August from a back injury. Hairston hit just .189 with three home runs, 16 RBI, and five stolen bases on the season.\n\nCincinnati Reds\nOn March 3, 2008, Hairston signed a minor league contract with the Cincinnati Reds. Hairston credits newly hired Reds manager Dusty Baker, who managed him while with the Cubs, for saving his career after struggling in 2006 and 2007.  On April 21, his contract was purchased by the Reds and he was added to the roster. Hairston broke his thumb sliding into second base on June 9, the same game Ken Griffey Jr. hit his 600th home run. He also missed time with a hamstring injury. After coming off the disabled list, Hairston re-aggravated the injury in his first game back. Despite these setbacks he enjoyed a nice bounce-back season in 2008, hitting .326 with a .384 on-base percentage across 297 plate appearances. He also had 15 stolen bases, his most since 2002, despite only playing in 80 games.\nOn January 7, 2009, he re-signed with the Reds; the contract contained $2 million in guaranteed money. Hairston represented Mexico at the 2009 World Baseball Classic alongside his brother Scott. Hairston's mother was born in Mexico, making him eligible to play for the Mexican team. He had four hits in 14 at-bats for Team Mexico. Hairston hit .254 with a .397 OBP, eight home runs, and 27 RBI in 86 games for Cincinnati, mostly playing second, third, and shortstop.\n\nNew York Yankees\nOn July 31, 2009, he was traded to the New York Yankees for minor league catcher Chase Weems. The move was made to help shore up the team's bench, with Brett Gardner on the disabled list, and to spell Johnny Damon, Derek Jeter, and Alex Rodriguez when needed. On August 1, Hairston got his first hit and RBI as a Yankee. In his time with the Yankees, he hit .237 with two home runs and 12 RBIs in 45 games\nOn October 17, 2009, he got his first career post-season hit in his first career post-season at-bat, and later ended a 13-inning ALCS Game 2 by scoring on an error by the Angels' Maicer Izturis. This gave the Yankees a 2–0 advantage going into the third game of the series. He had one hit in six at-bats for the Yankees in the 2009 World Series.\n\nSan Diego Padres\nOn January 18, 2010, Hairston signed a one-year, $2.15 million contract with the San Diego Padres, the same team that his brother, Scott Hairston, was playing on. After Everth Cabrera went down with a hamstring injury in April, Hairston became the team's starting shortstop for much of the season's first half. He also replaced David Eckstein at second base when the veteran suffered a calf strain in July.\nHairston's 2010 season was cut short by injury. He suffered an elbow injury at the end of August and then broke the tibia in his right leg a week after coming off the disabled list. Hairston still played in 119 games with the Padres, hitting .244 with a career-high 10 home runs (tied with 2009) and 50 RBI, despite playing his home games at notoriously pitcher friendly Petco Park.\n\nWashington Nationals\nOn January 19, 2011, Hairston agreed to a one-year, $2 million contract with the Washington Nationals that included over $1 million in incentives. He became the team's starting third baseman after Ryan Zimmerman missed significant time to an abdominal injury. He missed most of July with a broken wrist after being hit by Angels pitcher Dan Haren. On July 20, his first game back from the disabled list, Hairston had three hits, including a two-run home run off J.A. Happ. He played in 75 games for the Nationals, hitting .268 with four home runs and 24 RBI.\n\nMilwaukee Brewers\nOn July 30, 2011, Hairston was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers for Double-A outfielder Erik Komatsu. The trade was made in order to help fill in for injured second baseman Rickie Weeks and outfielder Carlos Gomez, and offer an improvement over Casey Mcgehee at third base and Yuniesky Betancourt at shortstop. He hit .274 in 45 games for the Brewers.\nHairston was included on the team's playoff roster as the starting third baseman. In Game 4 of the National League Championship Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, he had a clutch double to get the Brewers on the board. Hairston then managed to score by sliding around the tag from Yadier Molina to tie the game. However, he committed one of Milwaukee's four errors in Game 5 that put them behind in the series, which they lost in six games. Overall, Hairston hit .385 with six doubles and four RBI in 11 postseason games.\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers\nOn December 5, 2011, the Los Angeles Dodgers signed Hairston to a two-year contract worth $6 million.\nOn June 1, 2012, Hairston was part of a Dodgers lineup that featured the sons of five former major leaguers (along with Tony Gwynn Jr., Iván DeJesús Jr., Dee Gordon and Scott Van Slyke). This was the first time in Major League history that this had occurred. It was also the first time a starting infield of four major league sons had ever occurred: first baseman Van Slyke, second baseman Hairston, third baseman De Jesus and shortstop Gordon.\nOn August 22, it was determined that Hairston would need surgery on his left hip. The injury had bothered him for some time before he finally went on the disabled list on August 13. The surgery would sideline him for the rest of the season. In 78 games with the Dodgers in 2012, Hairston hit .273 while playing numerous different positions.\nIn 2013, Hairston was a key reserve for the Dodgers, playing 28 games at third base, 23 in left field, 4 in right field, 13 at first base and 1 at second base. He struggled with the bat however, hitting just .211.\n\nBroadcasting career\nOn December 11, 2013, it was announced that Hairston would be retiring as an active player to join the Dodgers pre and post game broadcasting crew on SportsNet LA.\n\nPerformance-enhancing drugs controversy\nAccording to a report by Sports Illustrated, Hairston received genotropin, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and clomiphene citrate in 2004. One of Hairston's prescriptions was written by \"A. Almarashi.\" Investigators believe Almarashi is an alias for a Queens, N.Y., doctor stripped of her medical license in 1999. She is awaiting trial on multiple charges after allegedly writing bogus prescriptions for thousands of online customers she never examined.\nHairston denied any connection, stating \"Not one time have I taken steroids or anything like that. [ . . .] I would never do anything like that to jeopardize my career or my family's name.\" He further responded, saying that \"I’ve tested in the offseason, tested in spring training, tested during the season, and never tested positive.\"\nOn December 13, 2007, he was cited in the Mitchell Report to the Commissioner of Baseball of an Independent Investigation Into the Illegal Use of Steroids and Other Performance Enhancing Substances by Players in Major League Baseball.\n\nPersonal life\nHairston is Black and Mexican. His family is descended from the slaves of the wealthy Scotch-Irish Hairston family that owned plantations throughout the United States South.\nJerry's brother Scott Hairston is also a professional baseball player. Their father Jerry Hairston Sr., uncle Johnny Hairston, and grandfather Sam Hairston were also major league players. Several other members of his family played in the minors. Hairston became a Jehovah's Witness in July 2000.\n\nSee also\nThird-generation Major League Baseball families\nList of Major League Baseball players named in the Mitchell Report\n\nReferences and citations\nExternal links\n Media related to Jerry Hairston, Jr. at Wikimedia Commons\nCareer statistics from MLB · ESPN · Baseball Reference · Fangraphs · Baseball Reference (Minors) · Retrosheet   · Baseball Almanac  , or Retrosheet",

    "text": "Ripa di Fagnano Alto is a village in the Province of L'Aquila, in the Abruzzo, region of Italy. The village is situated on a mountain and over looks the east of the region. Its last recorded population was 93 people.\n\nHistory\nFounding\nRipa comes into historical notes in the late 1230s. It is believed that the village was founded during Frederick II's order to develop defensive outposts along the Abruzzo mountain ranges. Other villages such as Collepietro and Tocco are also believed to have been founded in the same era, close to when the region's capital L'Aquila, being founded in 1240.\n\nWorld War II\nFollowing World War II, a large percentage of Ripa's population emigrated, after the German occupation of the village had left little for the future of the new generation. Most of the towns people emigrated to Canada, while there were notable numbers who emigrated to Australia, the United States and Argentina. It is considered to be the main reason why the population has diminished to near abandoning.\n\nGeography\nThe village distance 1.90 kilometres from the same town of Fagnano Alto where it belongs along with the villages of Campana (1.03 miles), Castello (1.76 miles), Colle (1.11 miles), Corbellino (0.50 km ), Frascara (2.12 miles), Opi (3.80 miles), Pedicchio (2.57 miles), Termine(1.34 km) and Vallecupa (- km).  The village overlooks the valley of the river Aterno, about 752 meters from sea level and is approximately 20 kilometres from L'Aquila. \nIt rises on a hill overlooking the valley from which appointed Ripa, whose origin would be assigned as the far side of the earth, that overhangs the water, especially the shore, the margin of a river, a stream of a stream.  Its houses are built with mortar and stone still respects the original building with stables on the ground floor and housing on the first floor.\n\n2009 earthquake aftermath\nFollowing the earthquake in 2009, the village suffered moderate damage. Most houses suffered cracks, and in some cases, minor collapses, with most of the houses being built of stone, and thin concrete. The most notable collapse in the village was the Church of Saint Anthony, with the bell tower collapsing. Despite the damage, there were no fatalities.\n\nReligion\nThe people of Ripa are predominantly Roman Catholic. There are two religious sites: the church of St. Anthony, whose bell tower suffered a partial collapse in the earthquake of the Eagle of the sixteenth century, with frescoes of 1533, 1559 and 1562. The church's bell tower was destroyed following the 2009 earthquake. The other church is the church of St. Rocco, carved into the rock on top of the hamlet, with terracotta Madonna and Child in the fifteenth century. The patron saint is St. Rocco and is celebrated on August 16.\n\nTourism\nCharacterised by cold winters and short summers, Ripa has a permanent population of about forty units, also welcomes many tourists on weekends and during the summer months, including expatriates in Belgium and Canada. \nSince 1998 the publishing house il Sirente is located there, in Via Fonte di Sotto No. 1.",

    "title": "Classification scheme (information science)",
    "text": "In information science and ontology, a classification scheme is an arrangement of classes or groups of classes. The activity of developing the schemes bears similarity to taxonomy, but with perhaps a more theoretical bent, as a single classification scheme can be applied over a wide semantic spectrum while taxonomies tend to be devoted to a single topic. \nIn the abstract, the resulting structures are a crucial aspect of metadata,  often represented as a hierarchical structure and accompanied by descriptive information of the classes or groups. Such a classification scheme is intended to be used for the classification of individual objects into the classes or groups, and the classes or groups are based on characteristics which the objects (members) have in common.\nThe ISO/IEC 11179 metadata registry standard uses classification schemes as a way to classify administered items, such as data elements, in a metadata registry.\nSome quality criteria for classification schemes are:\n\nWhether different kinds are grouped together. In other words, whether it is a grouping system or a pure classification system. In the case of grouping, a subset (subgroup) does not have (inherit) all the characteristics of the superset, which means that the knowledge and requirements about the superset are not applicable for the members of the subset.\nWhether the classes have overlaps.\nWhether subordinates are allowed to have multiple superordinates. Some classification schemes allow that a kind of thing has more than one superordinate, others do not. Multiple supertypes for one subtype implies that the subordinate has the combined characteristics of all its superordinates. This is called multiple inheritance (of characteristics from multiple superordinates to their subordinates).\nWhether the criteria for belonging to a class or group are well defined.\nWhether the kinds of relations between the concepts are made explicit and well defined.\nWhether subtype-supertype relations are distinguished from composition relations (part-whole relations) and from object-role relations.\n\nIn linguistics\nIn linguistics, subordinate concepts are described as hyponyms of their respective superordinates; typically, a hyponym is 'a kind of' its superordinate.\n\nBenefits of using classification schemes\nUsing one or more classification schemes for the classification of a collection of objects has many benefits.  Some of these include:\n\nIt allows a user to find an individual object quickly on the basis of its kind or group.\nIt makes it easier to detect duplicate objects.\nIt conveys semantics (meaning) of an object from the definition of its kind, if no meaning is conveyed by the name of the individual object or its way of spelling.\nKnowledge and requirements about a kind of thing can be applied to other objects of that kind.\n\nKinds of classification schemes\nThe following are examples of different kinds of classification schemes.  This list is in approximate order from informal to more formal:\n\nthesaurus – a collection of categorized concepts, denoted by words or phrases, that are related to each other by narrower term, wider term and related term relations.\ntaxonomy – a formal list of concepts, denoted by controlled words or phrases, arranged from abstract to specific, related by subtype-supertype relations or by superset-subset relations.\ndata model – an arrangement of concepts (entity types), denoted by words or phrases, that have various kinds of relationships. Typically, but not necessarily, representing requirements and capabilities for a specific scope (application area).\nnetwork (mathematics) – an arrangement of objects in a random graph.\nontology – an arrangement of concepts that are related by various well defined kinds of relations. The arrangement can be visualized in a directed acyclic graph.\nOne example of a classification scheme for data elements is a representation term.\n\nSee also\nISO/IEC 11179\nFaceted classification\nMetadata\nOntology (computer science)\nRepresentation class\nRepresentation term\nSimple Knowledge Organisation System\nSemantic spectrum\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOECD Glossary of Statistical Terms – Classification Schemes\nISO/IEC 11179-2:2005 Metadata registries (MDR) – Part 2: Classification\nNancy Lawler's presentation on Classification Schemes Archived 2007-09-28 at the Wayback Machine",

    "text": "Sunderland Arc was a privately owned, non-profit, urban regeneration company based in Sunderland, North East England. It ceased operations in 2011.\n\nHistory\nThe Sunderland arc Task Group was originally appointed in June 2002 by the former Trade and Industry Secretary, Rt. Hon. Stephen Byers MP.\nThis followed the closures and associated job losses at Grove Cranes and the Vaux Brewery, both of which were key private employers in traditional industries close to the City Centre. The Task Group was charged with developing and implementing a strategic vision to tackle the severe economic and social problems facing a substantial area of Sunderland and its communities.\nThe resulting framework, set out a fifteen-year vision for the Sunderland arc area that would radically transform the heart of Sunderland. The strategic objectives outlined in the framework are detailed below.\n•\tTo accelerate the revival of Sunderland, integrating major physical\nredevelopment with comprehensive social regeneration in support of\nthe Government's National Strategy for Neighbourhood Renewal and\nthe Urban White Paper.\n•\tTo accelerate redevelopment of the former Vaux, Holmeside and\nFarringdon Row sites ensuring that end uses support Sunderland\narc's four strategic programmes – raising aspirations, creating\nsustainable neighbourhoods, developing ICT and the promotion of\nkey development sites within the relevant planning framework and in\nsupport of the rest of the city.\n•\tTo pursue sustainability of the environment and development of\ncommunity assets to underpin regeneration in active support of\nLocal Agenda 21.\n•\tTo support the Deputy Prime Minister's major initiative and pilot\nexciting new ways of promoting ‘joined up’ service and regeneration\ndelivery, including neighbourhood management and effective local\nconsultation following the very successful community visioning\nexercise.\n•\tTo develop innovative delivery mechanisms, which will maximise the\nimpact of public and private investment in the heart of Sunderland\nover a fifteen-year period.\nTWO\nThe boundary of the Sunderland arc area stretched along the south bank of the River Wear from Claxheugh Rock in the west to the Port in the east. The boundaries also encompass the Stadium of Light, St. Peter's Campus and the National Glass Centre on the north bank.\nThe Company's Board for the first five years was chaired by leading industrialist Bryan Sanderson, then John Anderson, a substantial business figure from the NE of England. The experienced Executive Team was led by Chief Executive Tom Macartney who had previously led the successfully regeneration of the Gorbals of Glasgow. David Waker followed on from Tom Macartney and led the arc for three years.\nThe priorities for development in the five years included bringing forward\nthe following substantial sites:\n•\tthe former Vaux Brewery/Farringdon Row Site,\n•\tthe historic quarter of Sunniside,\n•\tHolmeside,\n•\tStadium Park and Sheepfolds,\n•\tSunderland Strategic Transport Corridor.\nThe Arc made significant progress in the Sunniside area, with the opening of a new arts centre, several new bars and restaurants, new business space, a new leisure complex incorporating a bowling alley and multiplex cinema, hundreds of new apartments, and a new area of public art and sculpture on a newly landscaped Sunniside Gardens.  The Sunniside district, which lies on the eastern fringe of Sunderland City Centre, was awarded with the North East Renaissance Award from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.\nOne of the main thrusts over the first five years of the arc was the company moving a proposed Tesco Extra from a city centre site, the former Vaux Brewery site. For over five years Tesco did not wish to move and a very substantial planning dispute involving large teams of planners, architects, surveyors and legal experts ensued.\n\nSee also\nSpirit of Sunderland\nNew River Wear Crossing\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "The Museum of Arts and Popular Customs of Seville  (Spanish: Museo de Artes y Costumbres Populares) is a museum in Seville, Andalusia, Spain, located in the María Luisa Park, across the Plaza de América from the Provincial Archeological Museum. The museum had 84,496 visitors in 2007.\n\nHistory\nThe museum occupies the Mudéjar Pavilion (Pabellón Mudéjar) designed by Aníbal González and built in 1914. It served as an art pavilion, the Pabellón de Arte Antiguo, for the Ibero-American Exposition of 1929, when Aníbal González had the opportunity to design several additional permanent buildings for the plaza. The exterior is ceramic over brick, and has three doors with archivolts adorned with glazed tiles (azulejos).\nThe building originally consisted of two stories over an aeration chamber (necessary because of the humidity). In the 1960s, the main floor, originally over 12 metres (39 ft) high, was divided in two, with an intermediate level added by architect Delgado Roig. In 1972, as part of the preparations for the current museum, the various stories of the building were connected by a grand spiral staircase designed by José Galnares Sagastizábal.\nThe museum was established by a decree of 23 March 1972, initially as a section of the Museum of Fine Arts of Seville. It opened its doors to the public 4 March 1973. For the next seven years, the museum fell under the responsibility of the Ministry of Education and Science, but the city government occupied more than half of the poorly maintained building. Neither institution took full responsibility. This situation led to a series of temporary closures. In 1976, the electric bill could not be paid, and the museum had to be shut until it could get power again. In 1979, heavy rains damaged the interior.\nOn 26 March 1980, the City Council agreed to allow the Ministry of Education and Science to use the whole building, for as long as it was used for the museum, on the condition that the Ministry would suitably restore it. On this basis, the Ministry hired architect Fernando Villanueva Sandino. The resulting restoration converted the primitive aeration chamber into a new lower-ground floor. The museum reopened 18 October 1984; at that same time the new Andalusian Autonomous Government took over the museum, along with other museums in Andalusia that had been operated by the central government of Spain.\nIn 1990 the main floor was further fitted out for temporary exhibitions, and in 1994 the Díaz Velázquez Collection was permanently installed, with a little over a third of the building remaining for temporary exhibitions.\n\nFacilities and layout\nThe public portion of the museum occupies the lower-ground floor, the main floor, and the additional floor (now \"first floor\") that was created by Delgado Roig. The permanent exhibition space amounts to 5,496 square metres (59,160 sq ft). The upper floor contains the museum library (specialized in ethnography and museology). There is also a photo archive, audiovisual and conference rooms, as well as a restoration studio and a photography laboratory. Temporary exhibitions can be visited independently of visiting the rest of the museum.\nAs of 2010, the arrangement of exhibits is:\n\nMain floor\nHalls I–II: Díaz Velázquez collections of embroidery and lace.\nHalls III–V: Temporary exhibitions\nHalls VI–VII: Recreation of the Díaz Velázquez family dwelling\nFirst floor\nHalls I–II: Apparel, personal adornment, and religious objects\nHall III: Musical instruments and popular literature\nHall IV: Cultivation of wheat\nHalls V–VI: Goldsmithing and embroidery\nHall VII: Fittings and furniture\nLower-ground floor\nHall I: Functions of domestic furniture (mobilario)\nHall II: Functions of domestic furniture (ajuar)\nHall III: Types of domestic containers\nHall IV: Traditional offices\nHall V: Ceramics and tilemaking\nHall VI: Ceramics workshops. Popular use of ceramics\nHall VII: Winemaking\nHall VIII: La Cartuja (?) and Japanese ceramics\nHall IX: Knives and firearms\nHall X: Metalwork\nHall XI–XII: Various techniques of processing\nThis floor also includes storage areas, archives, audiovisual space, and the restoration studio.\nSources:\n\nCollections\nMost of the items in the museum date back to its original collection. The museum was founded as a section of the Museum of Fine Arts, and the largest and most significant portion of the collection came from that museum. Particularly notable are the Aguiar collection of costumbrista paintings; the Soria collection of Oriental porcelain and ivory; and some pieces from the Orleans and Gestoso collections. Other pieces have been donated by other museums, such as a collection of Sevillian azulejos (glazed tiles) donated by the Archeological Museum of Seville, and other donations from the Museo del Pueblo Español (Madrid), the Museum of Fine Arts Valencia, and from various smaller museums in Andalusia. Various people of Seville have also made important donations, filling gaps in the collections; for example, they have donated textiles, agricultural tools, household utensils, and musical instruments. Other pieces were purchased in the 1970s, when the museum came under the aegis of the Ministry of Education and Science. The largest donation after the founding was the 1979 Díaz Velázquez legacy, one of Europe's best collections of embroidery and lace, with nearly 6,000 pieces. Acquisitions since 2000 include the Loty collection of more than 2,000 glass panels depicting details Andalusian cities and life from roughly 1900 to 1936, and the 168-piece Allepuz ethnographic collection.\nThe collection of Andalusian popular ceramics has developed over time, and is rivaled only be the collection at the Museum of Ethnology, Hamburg. The city donated the originals of the posters for the annual Seville Fair (Feria de Abril). The Department of Culture supplemented this with the Mencos collection in the museum, the most complete known collection of lithographs and color photographs of Feria and Semana Santa (Holy Week in Seville) posters.\nOther acquisitions were the outgrowth of fieldwork: the research of Carmen Ortiz led to the donation of the cooperage workshop of Claudio Bernal, the city's last cooper; Andrés Carretero's work similarly led to the donation of the workshop of guitarmaker Francisco Barba; Esther Fernández work added a gilding workshop; other workshops donated included those of Filigrana, master maker of castanets, and of goldsmith Fernando Marmolejo. Marmolejo was the last in a four-centuries-old family profession, and some of his tools dated back centuries. The museum now has eight workshops on exhibit.\n\nUse as a film set\nThe building has been used several times as a set for films or television shows, including the 1974 American film The Wind and the Lion and the 1985 French Film Harem, where it was used as the British Embassy.\n\nNotes\nExternal links\n\nMuseum of Arts and Traditions of Sevilla, official site",

    "title": "Haunted Spooks",
    "text": "Haunted Spooks is a 1920 American silent comedy horror film, produced and co-directed by Hal Roach, starring Harold Lloyd and Mildred Davis.\nThe short film has a comedic version of a typical haunted house tale, and a dispute over a family's inheritance. A young woman is the heiress to a mansion and a plantation, but only if she is married. She quickly enters an arranged marriage with a stranger, and they travel to the mansion. Her uncle fakes ghostly apparitions, in order to scare them away and lay claim to the inheritance. At the end of the film, the husband and wife remember to enquire about their respective names.\n\nPlot\nThe action in Haunted Spooks centres around Harold's romantic problems. It is set in the South (\"[go] down the Mississippi and turn to the right\").\nThe opening sequence has an uncle reading a telegram regarding a will. It tells him that his niece Mildred will inherit the house and plantation, provided she lives there for a year with her husband. He tells his wife that they must scare them out of the house. A lawyer visits the niece to tell her of the will. She tells him she is not married and he says he can resolve the problem.\nWe then jump to Harold who is disappointed in love and vying for the attention of the Other Girl in rivalry with her other potential suitor. They compete to be first to ask her father for her hand in marriage. Harold wins but when he returns to the girl she is in the arms of yet a third man, so he gives up. He then tries, with notable lack of success, to commit suicide. Firstly using a gun he finds on a path, which turns out to be a water-pistol; then standing in front of a tram, which takes a sudden turn; then he ties a rock around his neck and jumps off a low bridge into a lake, but this fails as it is only inches deep; he then picks a second bridge, but lands in a boat; and finally stands in front of a car, which stops in time, but contains the lawyer from the earlier scene. He takes Harold to Mildred and arranges their marriage.\nThey then drive off to the mansion, with some jokes en route: the gesticulating passengers in the car in front appear to be signalling right then left, preventing overtaking; the birds in the back seat pecking his head.\nThey reach the mansion and the uncle plays a series of tricks to make the house appear haunted. A series of people appear in white sheets and covered in flour until the prank is uncovered. In a more unusual prank, a pair of trousers walk on their own, having a little black boy inside. We see Harold's hair stand on end then fall.\nThe film ends with the couple inquiring about each other's name and entering the bedroom together.\n\nCast\nHarold Lloyd as The Boy\nMildred Davis as Mildred Hillary, The Girl\nWallace Howe as The Uncle\nSammy Brooks as Short Butler (uncredited)\nGaylord Lloyd (uncredited)\nSam Lufkin as Man arguing in car (uncredited)\nErnest Morrison as Little Boy (uncredited)\nDee Lampton as Tall Butler (uncredited)\nCharles Stevenson as Winning Suitor (uncredited)\nBlue Washington as Negro Butler (uncredited)\nNoah Young as Chef (uncredited)\n\nProduction\nThe film began shooting on August 9, 1919 and halted on the 23rd of that month due to an accident. Lloyd was posing for publicity photos, and a prop bomb exploded in his hand. He lost two fingers, his face was badly burned and he was temporarily blinded. In subsequent films, he wore a prosthetic glove fitted with artificial fingers. After four months of recovering the film resumed on January 5, 1920 and continued through the 25th. There was very little public knowledge about the loss of Lloyd's fingers, but people knew of the accident. Lloyd wanted it that way because he did not want people to watch his films for sympathy or curiosity, but to watch his films \"because they were good, laughable, and delightful comedies\".\nLloyd's salary doubled after his return to this film. After this movie, he moved away from slapstick and went towards more intellectual \nand romantic comedies. Three years after this film was made, Harold Lloyd married his co-star Mildred Davis, whose brother Jack was a member of Hal Roach's Our Gang comedies. They remained married until her death in 1969.\nHaunted Spooks was filmed on location at Hancock Park and what is now MacArthur Park. The scenes at the haunted mansion were filmed at Hal Roach Studios, in Culver City, California. The film had a lot of racist humor in it, revolving mainly around the frightened black servants in the house showing then-stereotypical behavior such as shaking knees and wide eyes. One of the servants was even played by a white actor in blackface. \"One can even conclude that the film's title is a racist slur\" according to critic Christopher Workman.\n\nSee also\nHarold Lloyd filmography\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nHaunted Spooks at IMDb\nHaunted Spooks at the TCM Movie Database (archived version)\nHaunted Spooks at the AFI Catalog of Feature Films",

    "text": "The Tatra K1 was an experimental tramcar developed by ČKD Tatra between 1964 and 1965.\n\nHistory\nPrevious Tatra units were concerned primarily with increasing capacity in a single tramcar. Tatra sought to correct this shortcoming by developing its first articulated tramcar, the K1. The K1 was largely based on the established T3, although certain electrical aspects were adjusted for the K1. In 1965, two prototypes were built with numbers 7000 and 801 (the second prototype never had the number 7001) with electro-pneumatic equipment UA 11. The second one was shipped to Ostrava. After a short trial in Prague with the prototype 7000, it entered Ostrava service with 800. They remained there for three years until October 1, 1968, before it was returned to the manufacturer. The test runs exposed problems with the electronic equipment. Thus, the two prototypes were the only ones ever produced. \nThe first prototype underwent reconstruction to functional sample KTX (later KT4) with a shortened body, in 1969. This sample was subjected to the test drives. It was sent in 1971 into Liberec on meter gauge. From Liberec, it was sent back in the winter of 1972/73. After this prototype was renumbered to 8004, it took on new thyristor electric equipment TV 2. After several test runs, it was retired and used as a warehouse in a Prague depot called Hloubětín. The second prototype was never put into operation again. Instead it was used as a warehouse in ČKD Tatra until the second half of the 1970's when both prototypes were scrapped.\n\nProduction\nNote: This is the list of first owners.

He competed at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, where he won a gold medal in horizontal bar and a bronze medal in the all-around, and he won the all-around at the 1979 European Championships.\n\nPersonal life\nDeltchev began gymnastics when he was 10; he initially played football, and his father noticed his athleticism and decided to put him in a more individual sport. He has a daughter, Deliana.\n\nCareer\nDeltchev competed at the 1977 European Championships, where he won the gold medal in the horizontal bar final. That year, at an invitational competition in Riga, he first competed the horizontal bar move now named after him, which was the first aerial release move on the apparatus.\nThe following year, he competed at the 1978 World Championships, where he finished eighth in the all-around and won two bronze medals in the apparatus finals, one in pommel horse and the other with the horizontal bar, where he tied with Gennady Krysin.\nIn 1979, Deltchev won the all-around at the 1979 European Championships. He was the first man representing a country outside the Soviet Union to win the competition in fourteen years. He also competed at the 1979 World Cup, where he won bronze in the all-around as well as gold on the floor exercise.\nDeltchev represented Bulgaria at the 1980 Summer Olympics, where he won the all-around bronze medal. In the event finals, he became the Olympic champion on the horizontal bar.\nIn an interview about his career in 2002, Deltchev reflected on how he trained many different skills that he was not able to put into his competitive routines, as he was Bulgaria's main gymnast during his career and often traveled to compete. He first succeeded with his eponymous high bar move after watching another gymnast attempt it at his gym; the gymnast's coach encouraged Deltchev to try it, and he managed to regrab the bar on his third attempt. He claimed he invented his eponymous move on the rings by accident after his grip became stuck on the rings.\nAfter he finished competing, Deltchev went to Liverpool, England to coach for several months, before he moved to the United States in 1991. He initially worked in Napa, California, and he now owns a gymnastics school in Reno, Nevada. \nIn 2008, he was named to the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame. In 2019, he and other Bulgarian gymnasts such as Boriana Stoyanova were recognized for their achievements at the opening of the 2019 Bulgarian championships.\n\nEponymous skills\nDeltchev has two eponymous skills listed in the men's Code of Points, one on the rings and one on the horizontal bar:\n\nHis high bar skill, performed on the uneven bars, is also named for him in the women's Code of Points.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nStoyan Deltchev at World Gymnastics\nStoyan Deltchev at the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame\nStoyan Deltchev at Olympedia",

    "text": "A caucus chair is a person who chairs the meetings of a caucus.  Often, the caucus chair is assigned other duties as well.\n\nCanada\nIn Canada, the elected members of each party in Parliament, including senators, or a provincial legislature, elect among themselves a caucus chair who presides over their meetings. This person is an important figure when the party is in opposition and an important link between cabinet and the backbench when the party is in government.\n\nUnited States\nIn common U.S. Congressional Republican caucus legislative usage, the caucus chairman is styled conference chairman and is outranked by the Speaker or Senate President pro-tempore, and the leader or whip of his party.\nThe duties of a caucus chairman depend upon the political party caucus.  In the Republican Conference in the U.S. House of Representatives, for instance, the caucus chairman is in charge of coordinating the party's overall message.\nThe position of caucus chairman may or may not lead to higher office.  Republican conference chair John Anderson and Democratic Caucus Chair Richard Gephardt unsuccessfully sought their party's Presidential nominations in 1980 and 1988 respectively.  Anderson took his following and ran as a third party presidential candidate the same year, and never again achieved national prominence as a Republican.  Gephardt though was elected as the Democratic leader of the House of Representatives in 1989, and stayed in that position through 2002, before stepping down to run unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for President again in 2004. Gephardt helped nominate John Kerry by promptly endorsing him after Kerry defeated him in the Iowa caucuses.\nMany state legislative bodies have caucus chairmen for both party caucuses in the House and in the Senate.  The duties of the caucus chairman, as with the federal government, depend on the decisions of the caucus.  The number of times each caucus meets, the role of each caucus in aiding legislative decision-making, the interrelationships with other caucus leaders and memberships, the assignment of political and institutional duties, all vary in accordance with local traditions and personalities.\nCaucuses do not always function well.  In Congress in the 1950s, for instance, the House Democratic Caucus met so infrequently that insurgent Democrats formed the House Democratic Study Group, led by Rep. Eugene J. McCarthy, later a U.S. Senator and Presidential candidate, to do the work of reviewing legislation now generally done by caucuses under the direction of the caucus chairmen.\nCaucuses have zealously guarded their prerogatives from the executive branch.  When outgoing Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson became Vice-President, the President of the Senate, he suggested that his duties should include presiding over the Senate Democratic Caucus.  Senate Democratic Caucus members generated enough opposition, to what they perceived as executive branch intrusion, that Johnson dropped his idea.\n\n\n== References ==",

(The aforementioned Tri-County League, which was smaller than the peer Northern League and LPL in terms of enrollment, was originally entitled as such due to also including high schools from neighboring Kern and Fresno counties at the time, in addition to San Luis Obispo County.)\nBriefly, the association also reached into the Pacific View and Channel leagues on a football basis, but heading into the fall of 2022, the alignment was simplified to revert to a more historical format when Cabrillo, Lompoc and Santa Ynez rejoined the CCAA's fellow 13 schools in the Central Section and, thus in turn, its Mountain and Ocean leagues.

    "text": "Nicolaas Adrianus Rupke (born 22 January 1944 in Rotterdam) is a Dutch historian of science and biographer, who began his academic career as a marine geologist.\nHe studied biology and geology at the university of Groningen and geology and the history of science at Princeton and Oxford. Early in his studies, Rupke was a Christian and proponent of Flood geology, but later came to reject this position. When in 1977 he was elected to a Wolfson College, Oxford research position in the history of science, Rupke made this subject his full-time occupation. A series of similar international research posts followed, until in 1993 he took up a professorship at Göttingen University to teach the history of science and medicine. In 2009, Rupke was awarded a Lower Saxony research chair. In 2012, he took up an endowed professorship at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia, USA.\nRupke is known for his studies of late-modern biology, geology and science & religion. With an interest in the biographical approach, he restored to their contemporary prominence several nineteenth-century scientists, most important among them Richard Owen who well before the appearance of The Origin of Species developed a naturalistic theory of evolution, albeit a non-Darwinian one.\nStudies of Alexander von Humboldt came next, in which Rupke developed what he terms the metabiographical approach by exploring how a famous life – in this case Humboldt's – may be multiply retold and reconstructed as part of different belief systems and memory cultures.\nRupke is a fellow of Germany's National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina and of the Göttingen Academy of Sciences.\n\nSelected books\nDistinctive Properties of Turbiditic and Hemipelagic Mud Layers (with Daniel J.

    "text": "Hunter is a 1999 American science fiction novel by James Byron Huggins. Hunter was re-released in 2018. The novel was followed by the sequels Hunter's Moon and Last Hunt, both released in 2025 via WildBlue Press.\n\nPlot\nNathaniel Hunter, an expert tracker, with his wolf companion Ghost, finds a child lost in a snow storm. Deep in the Arctic Circle, a facility is attacked by a hulking creature. Colonel Maddox, Major Westcott, and the mysterious Dixon, consult with Dr. Tipler to identify the footprints and carnage left behind by the beast. Dr. Tipler deduces the creature kills similar to a grizzly but the footprints do not match that of a bear and recommends seeking the help of Hunter.\nThe trio seek Hunter's help and he too is unable to identify the species. Colonel Maddox asks Hunter to lead a kill team to track and kill the beast. Hunter is initially hesitant but accepts the job. Hunter meets the kill team led by Commander Takakura. Against Hunter's wishes, Dr. Tipler also joins the team as an observer. Bobbi Jo, the team's sniper, is assigned to lead the hunt alongside Hunter, whom which she bonds with over the course of the journey.\nIn Washington, the United States Marshals Service assigns Chaney the task to investigate the ravaged facilities in the Arctic Circle. Chaney consults with his former mentor Brick about the assignment, both feeling uneasy how things don't add up. Back at Dr. Tipler's institute, his assistants Gina and Rebecca examine a cast made from the creature's footprints. They recover a tendril from the plaster and Rebecca attempts to have the CIA's physicist Dr. Hamilton examine it.\nRebecca stresses that whatever the animal is, it is immune to disease but Dr. Hamilton shrugs off her theories and after she leaves, orders a hit on her. Rebecca is then killed in a car accident. Hunter and the team find the creature but the mission backfires when the beast begins hunting them and kills several soldiers. Dr. Tipler becomes sick, and the team is unable to radio for an extraction due to sabotage. Hunter decides to lead the creature away from the team so they can escape, and manages to hurt the beast with his Bowie knife. He eventually regroups with the team and leads them into a mine to take shelter. The creature reaches the mine and Hunter hurts it once more with the Bowie knife.\nChaney interviews both Dr. Hamilton and Dixon about the ravaged facilities, but is only given vague answers. He eventually talks to Gina, who strongly believes Rebecca was murdered. Chaney breaks into Dr. Hamilton's house to find clues and finds an article about a strange hulking creature retrieved from ice during the 1970s. Chaney is then attacked by a hit squad but manages to neutralize them and heads to Brick's bar for help. They later go to the Tipler Institute to save Gina from another hit squad. Afterwards, they head to the last facility in the Arctic where Dr. Hamilton left to.\nHunter and the team reach a cavern where they know the creature is waiting for them. The beast speaks to Hunter, who reveals its name to be “Luther”. After shaking off the beast, Hunter and the team manage to escape and reach the last facility, where Colonel Maddox waits for them. Dr. Hamilton and his team have another creature, long dead, stored deep within the facility. They manage to synthesize a serum that maintains the creature's longevity without turning one into a beast themselves, similar to what happened to Luther.\nDr. Hamilton attempts to test this on Dr. Tipler but is stopped by Ghost. Hunter keeps the serum, knowing that it's something Dr. Hamilton doesn't want anyone to know about. Chaney and Brick arrive at the base and interviews Hunter and the team about their encounter with the creature. Dr. Tipler theorizes that the creature is an ancient smilodon. Dr. Hamilton gives Chaney a tour of the facility, while Hunter sneaks into the deep part of the base storing the other creature. Hunter finds a video of Luther injecting himself with a serum and turning into the smilodon-like creature that he and the team encountered.\nDr. Hamilton and his security team catch Hunter, and reveals that the operation is an attempt to make certain members of society immortal in order to control and shape the world from the shadows. Brick arrives and opens fire on the security team. Hunter knocks out Dr. Hamilton and destroys the dead creature. Up above, the Luther-creature arrives and attacks the facility. Dr. Tipler dies from a heart attack and Ghost dies battling the creature. Bobbi Jo manages to wound the beast with her Beretta Sniper enough for it to retreat. Dixon arrives with a kill team of his own, planning to tie loose ends by bombing the area, along with Hunter and the survivors.\nHunter threatens to destroy the synthesized serum if Dixon doesn't pull out his kill team. Dixon reluctantly complies but upon learning of Dr. Tipler's death, Hunter slashes the serum and forces Dixon into a helicopter, leaving Dr. Hamilton behind to be killed in the bombing. Hunter and the survivors intend on following the creature and kill it once and for all. They follow the creature to a cave and discover that it is the grave site of the species, who murdered each other in blind, cannibalistic rage. Brick, Takakura, and Dixon die in the final battle with the creature. Hunter sets the beast on fire and decapitates him with his Bowie knife. Hunter, Chaney, and Bobbi Jo leave the cave and are evacuated by the US Marshals, who arrest Dr. Hamilton who survived the aerial bombing.\n\nFilm adaptation\nIn September 2009, Sylvester Stallone acquired the film rights to Hunter to use as the basis for Rambo: Last Blood, at the time titled Rambo V: The Savage Hunt. Shortly after, Nu Image/Millennium Films released a concept poster and synopsis for Rambo V: The Savage Hunt. In November 2009, it was reported that the plot had reverted to Rambo crossing the Mexican border to rescue a girl from human traffickers. In October 2018, Stallone revealed plans to adapt Hunter into its own feature film with Balboa Productions producing.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nHunter – Official Publisher Page\nHunter on Amazon.com",

    "text": "The McAllen Giants were a minor league baseball franchise based in McAllen, Texas. In 1949 and 1950, the Giants played as members of the Class D level Rio Grande Valley League, hosting home games at Paris Field. The Giants qualified for the 1949 playoffs, before finishing last in 1950, which proved to be the final season of the league.\n\nHistory\nThe Giants were preceded by the 1938 McAllen Packers, who played as members of the Class D level Texas Valley League, reforming after a nine–season hiatus.\nIn 1949, McAllen returned to play in the Rio Grande Valley League, which reformed. The 1931 McAllen Palms won the Rio Grande Valley League championship in the leagues' previous season of play.\nThe McAllen \"Giants\" joined the six-team Class D level Rio Grande Valley League, with the Brownsville Charros, Corpus Christi Aces, Del Rio Cowboys, Donna Cardinals and Laredo Apaches beginning league play with McAllen on April 27, 1949. The McAllen Giants were owned by Earl Long.\nIn their first season of play, the 1949 McAllen Giants qualified for the four-team Rio Grande Valley League playoffs. The Giants placed fourth in the regular season standings, with a record of 70–68, playing the season under managers Fran Matthews and Phil Kuykendall. McAllen finished 18.0 games behind the 1st place Corpus Christi Aces in the final standings. In the playoffs, McAllen was swept in four games by Corpus Christi in the first round. McAllen pitcher Edward Arthur led the league with 198 strikeouts and teammate Harold Jackson had a 20–8 record, the best in the league.\nIn 1950, the Rio Grande Valley league became a Class C level league to begin the season, as the league expanded to eight teams. However, the Robstown Rebels and Donna-Weslaco Twins teams folded during the season, leaving six remaining teams. The league would not return to play in 1951.\nThe 1950 McAllen Giants finished a distant last in the Rio Grande Valley league final standings. With an average player age of 22.7, the Giants were by far the youngest team in the league.

    "title": "Salvador Puig Antich",
    "text": "Salvador Puig Antich (Catalan pronunciation: [səlβəˈðo ˌpudʒ‿ənˈtik]; 30 May 1948 – 2 March 1974) was a Spanish militant anarchist from Catalonia. His execution for involvement in a bank robbery and shooting a police officer dead became a cause célèbre in Francoist Spain for Catalan autonomists, pro-independence supporters, and anarchists. After fighting the Spanish state with the militant organization Iberian Liberation Movement in the early 1970s, he was convicted and executed by garrote for the death of a police officer during a shoot-out.\nFar left-wing Catalans viewed Puig Antich's judicial death as symbolic retribution for the region's fight for self-government, and his name became commonplace in Barcelona. The incident inspired works by Catalan artists Joan Miró and Antoni Tàpies, and a satirical play by the Catalan theater group Els Joglars. The 2006 film Salvador depicts Puig Antich's time on death row. After the Spanish Supreme Court declined an effort to review the execution, an Argentine court adopted the case under universal jurisdiction in 2013.\n\nIberian Liberation Movement\nSalvador Puig Antich was born 30 May 1948, in Barcelona, Spain. He was a member of the Workers' Commissions before he joined the Iberian Liberation Movement (Movimiento Ibérico de Liberación, or MIL). The group organized armed robberies against banks, which they called \"expropriations\", allegedly to fund their actions against Francoist Spain in 1972 and 1973. Puig Antich was meanwhile in London: Albert Melzer recalls him being \"among the circle of anarchist activists who gathered in London around Miguel García García in the early days of the Centro Iberico\" (Camden Town). He returned to Spain in September 1973. \nAfter a series of these robberies, he was arrested for the death of a police inspector during a shootout in the Calle Gerona, Barcelona. A military court sentenced him to death by garrote vil in the Model prison. His execution in March 1974 proceeded despite international outcry, as Spain's second state execution in eight years. University students in Barcelona and Madrid went on strike in protest of the execution, whereupon they fought with police.\n\nThe execution of Georg Michael Welzel (Heinz Ches)\nThe same day, Georg Michael Welzel, from Cottbus (then GDR), was executed in Tarragona, charged for killing a policeman. He was known as Heinz Ches because he declared it was his name and to be Polish, from Szczecin. The execution of Georg Michael Welzel, a common criminal, was seen as an intent of the Francoist regime to downplay the importance of the execution of a political activist like Puig Antich.\n\nLegacy\nSome Catalans interpreted Puig Antich's execution as symbolic retaliation for the region's fight for autonomy, which led to public demonstrations. As one of the last convicted revolutionaries executed by Franco, Puig Antich became a household name in Barcelona. The Internationalist Revolutionary Action Groups (GARI) formed to avenge his death.\nSeveral years after his 1974 execution, the Catalan performance group Els Joglars performed La torna, a 1977 satire against torture based on the execution of Puig Antich and Heinz Ches. Even though Francoist Spain had ended, along with its censorship laws, members of Els Joglars were jailed or forced into exile. Spanish theater groups protested across Spain. Catalan painters Joan Miró and Antoni Tàpies both alluded to Puig Antich's execution in their mid-1970s work. Miró's The Hope of a Condemned Man triptych features a line that \"sighs and falls with faltering resignation\" and flicked paint. Tàpies's Assassins lithograph series, presented at the Parisian Galerie Maeght, too was inspired by Puig Antich's execution and Spanish politics. The 2006 film Salvador depicts Puig Antich's time spent on death row.\nAn effort by family members and outside groups to review Puig Antich's case was rejected by the Spanish Supreme Court in 2007, but an Argentinian judge adopted the case along with several others under universal jurisdiction in 2013. In February 2025, the Ministry of Territorial Policy and Democratic Memory under Ángel Víctor Torres declared the trial of Puig Antich to have been \"illegal\" and formally nullified his death sentence.\nPuig Antich is interred in the Montjuïc Cemetery in Barcelona.\n\nSee also\nMargalida Bover\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links\n\nArticles about Salvador Puig Antich from the Kate Sharpley Library\nPapers at the Pavelló de la República CRAI Library",

    "title": "Joseph Ettedgui",
    "text": "Joseph Ettedgui (22 February 1936 – 18 March 2010), usually known simply as Joseph, was Moroccan-born London-based retailer and founder of the Joseph retail empire. After his death, the chair of the British Fashion Council Harold Tillman described him as: \"a great designer, retailer and entrepreneur\". Le Figaro fashion editor Godfrey Deeny has described him as: \"one of the half dozen greatest fashion retailers in the past half-century\".\n\nEarly life and career\nBorn in Casablanca, Morocco, on February 22, 1936, Joseph Ettedgui was the son of a Moroccan Jewish furniture retailer. Joseph’s father considered retailing to be a degrading profession and hoped his son would become a doctor or lawyer. Joseph had no such ambitions and moved to London with his brother Maurice in 1960 to train as a hairdresser. Two years later the brothers opened a hairdressing salon (Salon 33) in King's Road, Chelsea – one of the epicentres of Swinging London. In 1964, their brother Franklin joined them. In an interview in 1989 with the Jewish Chronicle, Joseph said: \"I really wanted to be an architect but I'm terribly impatient. I decided to take a course in hairdressing and I loved it; I loved the way you could transform someone in two hours\".\n\nMove into fashion retail\nJoseph Ettedgui began travelling to Paris to see the ready-to-wear collections. This led to a meeting and early business association with Japanese designer Kenzo Takada. He began to sell Kenzo sweaters in Salon 33, and in 1972 the first Joseph clothes store opened underneath the hairdressing premises. Kenzo sweaters in the store’s window were spotted by then Sunday Times fashion editor Michael Roberts and used in a photo shoot – a move credited with simultaneously launching both minimalist European fashion and the Joseph retail name to a wider UK audience.\nA high-tech Norman Foster-designed flagship store opened in Sloane Street, Knightsbridge in 1979, after which Joseph Ettedgui’s place as a retail pioneer was cemented. During the 1980s, own-brand knitwear and clothing were introduced. The Joseph brand expanded into restaurants (Joe’s Café) and homeware (Joseph Pour la Maison). Stores opened across London and other major fashion centres, including New York, Paris and Tokyo.\n\nInfluence and legacy\nJoseph Ettedgui assisted emerging fashion designers, including Margaret Howell, Katharine Hamnett, John Galliano and Azzedine Alaïa. He also championed architects and interior designers, working with names such as David Chipperfield and Eva Jiricna. British fashion designer John Richmond called him: \"the creator of modern retail\" and Italian designer and entrepreneur Miuccia Prada commented that Joseph's shops were: \"among the most beautiful in the world\". London-based Saks Fifth Avenue merchandise director Gail Sackloff recalled how her visiting American fashion buyers always wanted to visit Joseph stores in the 1980s because of the way he merchandised.\n\nLater ventures\nAfter selling the Joseph brand outright to its Japanese licensee in 2005, Joseph Ettedgui turned his attention and fortune to Connolly Luxury Goods, an offshoot of Connolly Leather, and the Belgravia Italian restaurant Il Vaporetto. As of November 2020, the Connolly retail business remains in the ownership of his widow, Isabel.\n\nPersonal life\nEttedgui married Edna Herz in 1959. They had two sons, Peter and Paul. He married second wife Isabel Pritchard in 1990. They had a daughter, Gigi. Peter Ettedgui became a documentary film maker.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nSanti, Anna (9 August 2008). \"The Drapers Interview: Joseph Ettedgui\". Drapers (subscription required). Brentford.

    "title": "The Prince of Carbery",
    "text": "The Prince of Carbery (Irish: Rí Mór Túath Chairbreach) is the traditional designation used by the head of the MacCarthy Reagh dynasty, a historic Gaelic-Irish ruling family based in what is now West Cork, Ireland. The title derives from the medieval lordship and later principality of Carbery, which emerged following the fragmentation of the Kingdom of Desmond in the 13th century.\nIt was established in 1281 for Donal Maol MacCarthy, the 2nd Lord of Carbery, after a treaty settlement with his cousin, Donal Roe MacCarthy, King of Desmond. Although no longer a sovereign title under Irish law, Prince of Carbery continues to be used in a cultural, historical, and genealogical context by the recognised head of the MacCarthy Reagh dynasty.\n\nHistorical Background\nThe Principality of Carbery arose after the division of the MacCarthy dynasty in the middle of the 13th century, when the MacCarthy dynasty came to the height of their authority over the southern territories in Munster. By 1251 Donal Gott MacCarthy, King of Desmond, died having consolidate the new territory of Carbery for his own son, who exercised authority over much of what is now West Cork, including coastal territories and inland lordships. It is from his progeny that the MacCarthy Reagh sept would stem. In 1281 Donal Got MacCarthy's son would be granted \"Desmond south of the River Lee\" by the King of Desmond.\n\nMedieval rule\nFrom the 13th to the late 16th century, the Princes of Carbery governed as Gaelic rulers under Brehon law, maintaining their own military forces, client lordships, and diplomatic relations. They were intermittently allied with or opposed to the Earls of Desmond and later interacted with the English Crown during the Tudor conquest of Ireland. While contemporary Irish sources typically styled the ruler of Carbery as Mac Carthaigh Riabhach, European genealogists and historians—particularly in French and Spanish works—frequently rendered the position as Prince of Carbery to reflect the scale and autonomy of the lordship.\n\nDecline and dispossession\nFollowing the Desmond Rebellions and the subsequent Plantation of Munster, the political autonomy of Carbery was progressively dismantled. By the early 17th century, much of the MacCarthy Reagh territorial power had been lost through confiscation, surrender, or sale, though elements of the family retained land. Finally, Donal na Pipi, 17th Prince of Carbery, saw few options available to him to retain his family's station and so decided to surrender Carbery under the notorious Surrender and Regrant policy in 1606. Despite the dynasty's antiquity, the family no longer retains its ancestral properties or wealth due to the many migrations the family has endured over the centuries.\n\nThe Modern Era\nChiefship of the Name\nThe lordship of Carbery was established in the 13th century by the sitting King of Desmond, and was passed to his descendants over the next four generations, it was his great-great-grandson (Donal Reagh MacCarthy) to be regarded as the founder and namesake of the MacCarthy Reagh clan itself. In the modern era, Prince of Carbery is used as a courtesy and traditional title by the Chief of the Name of MacCarthy Reagh, to reflect continuity with the medieval ruling house after a 400-year 'interregnum.'\n\nCultural and philanthropic role\nThe current chief manages endeavours to preserve the history of Carbery, promote Irish clan heritage, and support charitable initiatives to fight against poverty.\n\nSuccession\nSuccession to the chiefship traditionally followed Gaelic tanistry, but with the collapse of the Gaelic order and the death of Finghin of Banduff (the last Chief) in 1754, the chiefship fell into abeyance. In 2025 the hereditary dearbhfhine of the clan (i.e. the agnatic descendants of Donal na Pipi) elected the current chief.\n\nCoat of arms\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "German submarine U-14 was a Type IIB U-boat of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine during World War II. It served with 3rd U-boat Flotilla from 18 January 1936 to 31 October 1939. U-14 completed six wartime patrols and sank nine ships totalling 12,344 GRT.\n\nDesign\nGerman Type IIB submarines were enlarged versions of the original Type IIs. U-14 had a displacement of 279 tonnes (275 long tons) when at the surface and 328 tonnes (323 long tons) while submerged. Officially, the standard tonnage was 250 long tons (254 t), however. The U-boat had a total length of 42.70 m (140 ft 1 in), a pressure hull length of 28.20 m (92 ft 6 in), a beam of 4.08 m (13 ft 5 in), a height of 8.60 m (28 ft 3 in), and a draught of 3.90 m (12 ft 10 in). The submarine was powered by two MWM RS 127 S four-stroke, six-cylinder diesel engines of 700 metric horsepower (510 kW; 690 shp) for cruising, two Siemens-Schuckert PG VV 322/36 double-acting electric motors producing a total of 460 metric horsepower (340 kW; 450 shp) for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two 0.85 m (3 ft) propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to 80–150 metres (260–490 ft).\nThe submarine had a maximum surface speed of 12 knots (22 km/h; 14 mph) and a maximum submerged speed of 7 knots (13 km/h; 8.1 mph). When submerged, the boat could operate for 35–42 nautical miles (65–78 km; 40–48 mi) at 4 knots (7.4 km/h; 4.6 mph); when surfaced, she could travel 3,800 nautical miles (7,000 km; 4,400 mi) at 8 knots (15 km/h; 9.2 mph). U-14 was fitted with three 53.3 cm (21 in) torpedo tubes at the bow, five torpedoes or up to twelve Type A torpedo mines, and a 2 cm (0.79 in) anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of twentyfive.\n\nService history\nEarly in the war, on 3 September 1939 in the evening, U-14 attacked a Polish submarine with one torpedo from a surface, and claimed to have sunk it. In reality the Polish submarine, ORP Sęp, was not damaged as the torpedo launched by U-14 exploded prematurely.  According to Jan Bartelski, the torpedo also missed the target.\nAfter serving on six operational patrols, U-14 was used as a training boat and transferred to U-boat training flotillas, serving with the 23rd and 24th U-boat Flotillas until the end of the war. Despite the high casualties suffered by the Unterseebootwaffen (German submarine arm), U-14 suffered no known casualties during the war.\nU-14 was scuttled on 5 May 1945 at Wilhelmshaven.\n\nSummary of raiding history\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\nHelgason, Guðmundur. \"The Type IIB boat U-14\".

    "title": "Fag hag",
    "text": "A fag hag is, in gay slang, a woman who associates either mostly or exclusively with gay and bisexual men. The phrase originated in gay male culture in the United States and United Kingdom and was historically an insult. Some women who associate with gay men object to being called fag hags while others embrace the term. The male counterpart, for heterosexual men who have similar interpersonal relationships with gay and bisexual men, is fag stag.\n\nUsage\nFag hags are frequently stereotyped as outgoing women who are seeking a substitute for heterosexual relationships, or who are secretly (or openly) sexually attracted to gay men. In fact, many women who identify as fag hags are already in romantic relationships, either with straight men or with women, but seek out the alternative experience of socializing with gay men.\n\nRelated terms\nAmerican fag hag synonyms include fruit fly, queen bee, homo honey, fruit loop, Goldilocks, flame dame, fairy princess, gabe (a portmanteau of \"gay\" and \"babe\") and fairy godmother. \nIn the case of friendships between lesbians and gay men, the term dyke diva describes the gay man in the relationship. A straight man of platonic affinity with gay men is a fag stag; again, the usage is rare in mainstream sexual culture.\nFor men who have many lesbian friends the slang terms dutch boy, lesbro or dyke tyke apply.\nHeterosexuals who associate with lesbian, gay, and bisexual people may be called fruit flies regardless of their sex.\nFag hags, fag stags, etc. are regarded as belonging to the phenomenon of \"hagism\", the attachment of a person to a group defined by sexuality, even though they do not personally share that identity.\nIn the Philippines, heterosexual women who develop deep friendships or almost exclusively associate with the native bakla LGBT subculture are known as babaeng bakla (literally \"a woman who is a bakla [gay man]\"). They stereotypically acquire the mannerisms, campy sense of humor, lingo (swardspeak), and fashion sense of the bakla. They are also usually more extroverted and socially dominant. It is commonly perceived as a positive self-identification, and various prominent local celebrities (like Maricel Soriano and Rufa Mae Quinto) openly identify as babaeng bakla.\nGirlfag is a term similar to fag hag, but designate specifically attraction, either sexually or romantically, to gay men, sometimes to the point of identifying as queer or genderqueer. Men who are attracted to lesbians/sapphics also have their slangs, such as lesboy, guydyke, and boydyke.\n\nIn popular culture\nThe term has often been used in entertainment. It was used in the lyrics of hip hop group Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five's 1982 hit \"The Message\". Comedian Margaret Cho has written and regularly talks in her stand-up routines about being a fag hag. In an episode of the British TV sitcom Gimme Gimme Gimme, Tom refers to Linda as a fag hag. The term was used in multiple episodes of the sitcom Will and Grace when referring to characters Grace Adler and Karen Walker as their best friends are both gay men. The term was also used in one of the episodes of Sex and the City, in which Samantha overheard two women discussing her relationship with the actor Smith Jerrod, calling her a fag hag. English singer Lily Allen released a song called \"Fag Hag\" in 2008 as the B-side to \"The Fear\".\nThe first annual Miss Fag Hag Pageant took place in New York City on May 17, 2009 at Comix with judges Caroline Rhea, Michael Musto, Hedda Lettuce and Katina Corrao. Heather Shields took the first prize.\n\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\nDiscussion of the anthropology of the phrase\nFag Hag (1998 movie) at IMDB\nShepperd, D., Coyle, A., & Hegarty, P.

He was formerly the permanent representative to the United Nations at Geneva and high commissioner to Malaysia.\n\nEarly life and education\nAlaihuddin was born on 29 May 1958, to an aristocrat, Pehin Orang Kaya Digadong Seri Lela Dato Seri Utama Haji Mohamad Taha bin Pehin Orang Kaya Ratna Diraja Hussain. He has one child and is married to Datin Mariani Bongsu. He has a brother, Pehin Orang Kaya Setia Jaya Dato Paduka Haji Abu Hurairah. This made him the uncle of Huraini, clerk to the Legislative Council, and Hazarena, Intermediate Court Judge. He received a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in international studies from North Staffordshire Polytechnic in the United Kingdom in 1984.\n\nDiplomatic career\nIn 1986, Alaihuddin worked as the personal assistant to the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Zakaria Sulaiman, after joining the ministry in August 1984. He had two postings overseas: the Brunei high commission in New Zealand, where he worked as a second secretary in 1986, and the Brunei embassy in Washington, D.C., where he held the same position from 1987 to 1990. After his return to Brunei in 1990, he worked for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Southeast Asian political section in 1991. He headed the Brunei delegation to the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly in 1994.\nAlaihuddin was sent overseas once more in 1995, this time to work for the Brunei high commission in London as first secretary and then acting minister counselor. In the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he was appointed deputy director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade's (MOFAT) Department of International Organisations in 2001 and director of the department in 2003. In c. 2004, he was the Ministry of Communications' permanent secretary. He would then serve as the MOFAT's acting private and confidential secretary in January 2007. As the new Permanent Representative of Brunei to the United Nations Office at Geneva, Alaihuddin presented his credentials to Sergei Ordzhonikidze on 13 August 2007.\n\nMalaysia\nAlaihuddin was appointed as the Brunei high commissioner to Malaysia on 25 November 2014, with the Sultan consenting to give him his credentials at the Istana Nurul Iman on 14 September 2014. In September 2015, a group headed by Alaihuddin from Brunei paid a visit to Regional Corridor Development Authority's (RECODA) Kuching headquarters to discuss economic collaboration. \nIn 2019, Alaihuddin, during a Malaysia Healthcare Travel Council (MHTC)-hosted dinner in Kuala Lumpur, expressed hope for a friendship association between Brunei and Malaysian business owners to boost trade cooperation and leverage mutual strengths. He highlighted the importance of including both public and private sector members to sustain public-private partnerships as key economic growth drivers. This initiative aligns with Brunei's goal to strengthen economic ties within ASEAN.\nAlaihuddin paid Muhyiddin Yassin a courtesy call on 7 December 2020. He arrived to say goodbye as his stay in Malaysia would expire later that month. In addition, he received praise from Al-Sultan Abdullah for his six years of service in Malaysia, particularly for fostering closer ties and collaboration between the two countries.\n\nIndia\nOn 9 March 2021, Prince Al-Muhtadee Billah held separate audiences with the recently appointed envoys from Brunei, including Alaihuddin. On 22 September 2021, Alaihuddin gave the President Ram Nath Kovind a virtual ceremony in which he handed his credentials. He attended the 2nd Brunei Darussalam-India Joint Trade Committee Meeting on 11 March 2022. Later on 22 July, Kamalinne Pinitpuvadol, Secretary General of AALCO, paid him a courtesy call.\nAlaihuddin also accompanied Halbi Mohd Yussof to the Ministerial Session of the Strategic Conference, India Energy Week 2023, and the 9th Asian Energy Ministerial Roundtable.\n\nPersonal life\nAlaihuddin is married to Datin Hajah Mariani binti Haji Bungsu, a patron of ASEAN Ladies' Circle (ALC) Brunei.\n\nHonours\nThroughout his career, he has earned the following honours:\n\n Order of Seri Paduka Mahkota Brunei Second Class (DPMB; 15 July 2010) – Dato Paduka\n\n\n== References ==",

He received his diploma from the University of Bucharest in 1946; there he was an assistant professor from 1946 to 1950, a lecturer from 1950 to 1951, and an associate professor from 1952 to 1957. Additionally, from 1949 to 1957 he was a researcher at the Institute of Mathematics of the Romanian Academy. In 1957 he moved to the United States with his wife Alexandra Ionescu Tulcea (née Bagdasar), who had been his student. From 1957 to 1961 he worked as a research associate and visiting lecturer at Yale University. He received his doctorate from Yale in 1959 under the supervision of Einar Hille with thesis Semi-groups of Operators. Cassius Ionescu Tulcea was from 1959 to 1961 a visiting professor at Yale University, from 1961 to 1964 an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania, and from 1964 to 1966 a full professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. He became in 1966 a full professor at Northwestern University and retired from there as professor emeritus.\nHis marriage to his former student Alexandra Bagdasar lasted from 1956 to 1969 when they divorced. During their marriage, the two mathematicians  wrote a number of papers together, as well as a well-regarded research monograph on lifting theory. John von Neumann initiated lifting theory in functional analysis with applications in probability theory. The Ionescu-Tulcea theorem, an important existence theorem for time-discrete stochastic processes, is named after Cassius Ionescu Tulcea (1949). He also did research on mathematical game theory and mathematical economics. He co-authored a book on casino gambling and several textbooks on mathematics; he also wrote a 1981 book on casino dice games and gambling systems and a 1982 book on casino blackjack.\nIn 1957 he was awarded the Prize of the Romanian Academy of Sciences.

    "text": "The Lavochkin La-190, (a.k.a. Aircraft 190), was a swept wing jet fighter designed and manufactured by the Lavochkin Design Bureau from 1950.\n\nDesign and development\nThe La-190 was an all-metal aircraft with a bicycle undercarriage and mid set wings with 55° sweep at 1/4 chord. The afterburning, Lyul'ka AL-5 (TR-3A), axial flow turbo-jet engine was attached to the rear of the centre fuselage with the air intake at the extreme nose, and exhaust at the end of the rear fuselage. Access to the engine for maintenance and removal was gained by removing the rear fuselage aft of the wing.\nThe bicycle main and nose undercarriages were housed entirely within the fuselage with wing mounted outriggers in small pods at the wingtips. To increase the angle of incidence of the aircraft, to 20–22°, for take-off and landing, the twin wheeled levered suspension main undercarriage could be shortened or \"knelt\".\nThe swept wings were of medium taper with 2/3 span flaps / 1/3 span ailerons, and wing fences at approximately 1/2 span. The tail unit comprised a sharply swept fin with a delta tailplane at 2/3 fin length.\nAn early Soviet Airborne Interception radar was also fitted called Korshun – (Kite (the bird)), with a single aerial under a radome above the intake and a CRT for the pilot to manually track the target.\n\nHistory\nThe unusual layout of the La-190, combined with many innovations, including powered flying controls, and new manufacturing methods, challenged Lavochkin's design bureau. To assist with design, many test rigs were made to simulate parts of the aircraft and its systems. Aerodynamic models were also used in wind tunnels and as large-scale droppable gliding models.\nDespite all the preparations, major problems with the Lyul'ka engine caused several flame-outs, one of which caused serious damage during the ensuing deadstick landing.\nAlthough the La-190 displayed good performance during the limited flight testing carried out, the MAP – Ministerstvo Aviatsionnoy Promyshlennosti (Ministry of Aviation Industry) cancelled further work on Aircraft 190.\n\nSpecifications (La-190)\nData from Gordon, Yefim.

    "title": "Miss La La",
    "text": "Miss La La (April 21, 1858 - March 21, 1945) was an Afro-German aerialist who served as muse to Edgar Degas and was depicted in his 1879 painting Miss La La at the Cirque Fernando. She was also depicted in a poster for the Folies Bergère. She was the star of Troupe Kaira, a traveling circus act, and performed with the Cirque Fernando, based in Montmartre.\n\nEarly life\nLa La was born either Anna Olga Albertina Brown or Olga Brown in the then German/Prussian territory of Stettin (now Szczecin) to a black father and white mother. She was the fifth child of Marie Christine Borchardt, a German Jew (related to the circus owner Willy Borchardt), and William Wilhelm Brown, most likely a freedman from USA or United Kingdom. All five children were baptized in a Lutheran church in Stettin-Bredow.\n\nCareer\nLa La began touring as a child, approximately around age nine, when her mother placed her in the circus. An article claimed that fourteen year old Anna Olga traveled to New York, to hone her circus craft before officially debuting in 1879. At age 21, La La became the subject of Edgar Degas's sketches, leading to his 1879 painting Miss La La at the Cirque Fernando. She used multiple stage names throughout her career including Olga the Negress, Venus of the Tropics, African Princess, and Olga the Mulatto. She was also billed as La Femme Canon, La Mulatresse-Canon, and Black Venus. She played venues such as the Folies Bergère in Paris, the Royal Aquarium in London, and the Gaiety Theatre in Manchester. Olga often performed in duet with Graetz-born Theophila Szterker as Olga and Kaira, \"Black and White Butterflies\". With Troupe Kaira, La La performed a flying trapeze and human cannon ball act. One of her signature acts involved being \"pulled up to the height of the circus tent by biting down on a rope.\" The feat was performed at the height of 200 feet. Another signature stunt involved hoisting other people or a 200-pound cannon with her teeth. She was also known for her stunt of being hoisted up to her trapeze by her teeth. In 1888 Theophila died following a rehearsal trapeze accident, and after that La La retired from the circus.\n\nMarriage and family\nLa La married African-American circus contortionist Emanuel \"Manuel\" Woodson in 1888. The couple had three daughters who also became performers, forming a trio called The Three Keziahs. By the time World War I broke, the family likely lived in Brussels, and in 1915 had to deal with Emanuel's death. In this year Olga applied for the United States visa, which is the last information known about her life.\n\nLegacy\n\nLa La is the subject of various articles including ones in The Guardian and the New York Times as well as the 2007 scholarly work Miss La La's Teeth: Reflections on Degas and Race. Edgar Degas's portrait of her hangs in the National Gallery in London, England. Since 1937, the portrait has appeared in a variety of exhibitions at a number of venues, including the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles and the Morgan Library & Museum in New York. In 2018, the portrait was loaned to the Weston Park Museum in Sheffield, England for an exhibit about black circus performers in the series Circus! Show of Shows. From Oct. 2018 through February 2019, the portrait appeared in Posing Modernity: The Black Muse from Manet to Matisse and Beyond, an exhibit at the Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Art Gallery at Columbia University, curated by Dr. Denise Murrell. In 2024 the National Gallery held an exhibition 'Discover Degas & Miss La La' which included earlier drawings by Degas together with photographs and posters telling the story of Miss La La.\n\n\n== References ==",

After serving as governor, he was elected U.S. Senator from May 1, 1901 to March 3, 1905.\n\nPersonal life\nHe was born in Aurora, Illinois, and was of German ancestry. His education was attained in the public schools of his native state and he quit at the age of twelve.\nDietrich was married twice. His first wife, Elizabeth Slaker, died in 1887. After Elizabeth's death, he married Margretta Stewart in on October 27, 1909. Deitrich and Margretta lived in Hastings, Nebraska.\n\nCareer\nDietrich was employed as a clerk in a hardware store in St. Joseph, Missouri. He moved to Chicago, Illinois and engaged in the hardware business. He moved to Deadwood, Dakota Territory (now South Dakota), in 1875 and engaged in mercantile pursuits, delivering goods on pack animals through the Black Hills. He then located and owned the 'Aurora' mine.\nDietrich settled in Hastings, Nebraska, in 1878 and engaged in mercantile pursuits and in banking. Dietrich founded the German National Bank at Hastings and served as the president of the bank from 1887 to 1905. He became the president of the Hastings Board of Trade.\nElected in 1900, Dietrich served as Governor of Nebraska from January 3, 1901, to May 1, 1901. He resigned his governorship to replace interim U.S. Senator William V. Allen, who had been appointed in 1899 after Monroe L. Hayward died in office.\nHis tenure in the Senate lasted from May 1, 1901 to March 3, 1905. His Senate service was most notable as a pro-imperialist on the Lodge Committee that investigated war crimes during the Philippine–American War. He did not run for reelection in 1904.\n\nBribery charge\nBefore he assumed his Senate seat, Dietrich accepted money from Jacob Fisher in exchange for obtaining Fisher's appointment as a U.S. Postmaster. Dietrich and Fisher were charged with conspiracy to receive a bribe, accepting a bribe and profiting by the leasing of a building to the government. But before the trial could begin, Judge Vandeventer held that Dietrich could not be prosecuted because the alleged bribery occurred after he was elected, but before Dietrich had been sworn in on December 2, 1901. All the charges were dropped, and Dietrich continued to serve as a US Senator from Nebraska.\n\nDeath\nDietrich retired in 1905 and died in Hastings, Nebraska.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nUnited States Congress. \"Charles H.

The implementing law was replaced by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act in 2014.\n\nOverview\nEvery community in the fifty states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Republic of the Marshall Islands, and Republic of Palau, was associated with a Local WIB (LWIB). For each LWIB, a chief elected official (for example, a county commissioner or the mayor of a lead city) appointed members to sit on the WIB.  These appointed positions were unpaid.  At least 50% of a WIB's membership was required to come from private businesses.  There were also designated seats for representatives from labor unions and educational institutions like community colleges as well. Beyond these basic guidelines, many aspects of how an individual WIB operated could vary.\n\nPurpose\nThe WIB's main role was to direct federal, state and local funding to workforce development programs. WIBs conducted and published research on these programs and the needs of their regional economy. They also oversaw the One-Stop Career Centers, where job seekers could get employment information, find out about career development training opportunities and connect to various programs in their area. One-Stop Career Centers also provided many no-cost services to employers. Services varied by state and WIB.\nWIBs worked in conjunction with economic development related organizations to minimize the reaction time and create resources to intervene for both the dislocated workforce and the incumbent workforce members of a community.\n\nSee also\nLabor market area\n\nExternal links\nWorkforce Investment Act of 1998, from gpo.gov\nNational Association of Workforce Boards\nCalifornia Workforce Association",

While its general shape is similar to Prosipho gaussianus Thiele, 1912, it is uniquely distinguished by its initial whorls, which are covered in sparse, narrow radial folds rather than being smooth. A fresh shell of this species also features rows of fairly long, horny bristles.\nThe largest available specimen measures 11.5 mm high and 5.5 mm wide and has 5 whorls. The first two whorls show only the characteristic folds, which continue onto the third whorl before gradually fading. As a result, the last two whorls only exhibit the spiral ridges and dense growth lines.\nThe third whorl begins with only three ridges, which quickly increase to seven above the aperture. The body whorl has four distinct ridges and some less prominent ones on the lower process. The whorls are convex, and the body whorl is large with a straight lower process. The aperture is long and quite narrow, with an outer margin that is arched at the top and almost straight at the bottom.\n\nDistribution\nThis species occurs in the Davis Sea and the Ross Sea, Antarctica.\n\nReferences\nEngl, W.

    "text": "Dom Pérignon ( DOM perr-in-YON, French: [dɔ̃ peʁiɲɔ̃]) is a brand of vintage Champagne. It is named after Dom Pérignon, a Benedictine monk who was an important quality pioneer for Champagne wine but who, contrary to popular myths, did not discover the Champagne method for making sparkling wines.\n\nHistory\nThe first vintage of Dom Pérignon was 1921, and was only released for sale in 1936, sailing to New York on the SS Normandie.  The brand, not exploited, was given by Champagne Mercier to Moët in 1927 for a wedding between the two families.\n\nIn 1935, 300 bottles of a 1926-vintage precursor to Dom Pérignon were sold to Simon Bros. & Co., the company that imported Moët in the United Kingdom, who gave two bottles to each of their 150 best customers to commemorate their centenary. While these bottles were almost identical to the subsequent Dom Pérignon releases, they did not display the Dom Pérignon name, rather \"Champagne specially shipped for Simon Brothers & Co's Centenary 1835—1935.\" The wine got immediate attention in the marketplace and 100 boxes of the 1921 vintage were shipped to the United States shortly thereafter, this time displaying the Dom Pérignon name. James Buchanan Duke, the billionaire who founded the American Tobacco Company, ordered 100 bottles for himself. The 17 bottles sold at an auction in Christie's in New York City in June 2004 were part of that order (Doris Duke, the billionaire's daughter, had kept them in her cellar). According to Dom Pérignon cellar master Richard Geoffroy, who was Chef de Cave for Dom Pérignon from 1990 to 2018, the 1921 vintage had a \"distinctive bouquet comprising sandalwood, vanilla and praline\".\nUntil the 1943 vintage, Dom Pérignon was produced from regular vintage Moët & Chandon Champagne that was transferred to the special 18th century-style bottles after extended cellaring. It was, thus, effectively an \"oenothèque\" release of Moët & Chandon Vintage Champagne in a different bottle. From the 1947 vintage, Dom Pérignon has been produced separately from the start.\nIn 1971, the Shah of Iran ordered several bottles of the first vintage of Dom Pérignon Rosé (1959) for the 2,500-year celebration of the Persian Empire. A bottle of that champagne, from that order, was sold at auction for €24,758 in 2008.\nIn 1981, Dom Pérignon was chosen for the wedding of Lady Diana Spencer and Prince Charles. The magnums of Dom Pérignon Vintage 1961 served on that July 29 carried a special insignia created just for the ceremony.\n\nVintages\nDom Pérignon is always a vintage champagne, meaning that all grapes used to make the wine were harvested in the same year. The wine is not made in weak years, i.e. when the general quality of the harvest is considered to be too low. The earliest market release of a vintage is usually after 8-10 years for the standard champagne, with longer maturation times for special editions like the Second Plenitude or  Œnotheque (see below).\nFrom 1921 to 2013, Dom Pérignon champagne has been produced in 45 vintages. More than two vintage years in a row is a rare phenomenon, which until 2006 had only occurred three times: 1969–1971, 1998–2000, and 2002–2006 (the first time five vintages were produced in a row). The 2008 vintage was the first released out of sequence, after the 2009 vintage.\nThe 47 white Dom Pérignon vintages up to 2015 are 1921, 1926, 1928, 1929, 1934, 1943, 1947, 1949, 1952, 1953, 1955, 1959, 1961, 1962, 1964, 1966, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1973, 1975, 1976, 1978, 1980, 1982, 1983, 1985, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2015.\nSince 1959 a rosé version of Dom Pérignon is also produced. Twenty-eight Dom Pérignon Rosé vintages have been produced and released until 2023: 1959, 1962, 1964, 1966, 1969, 1971, 1973, 1975, 1978, 1980, 1982, 1985, 1986 (the first rosé vintage where the white version was not produced), 1988, 1990, 1992, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008 and 2009.\n\nSecond plenitude (P2)\nP2, meaning 'second plenitude'. Dom Pérignon choose the best grapes from any of the 17 Grands Crus, including the legendary Premier Cru, Hautvillers and it is released in three different maturation time periods called Plénitudes. After close to 15 years of slow transformation in the cellars, the taste is, according to Dom Perignon, \"wider, deeper, longer, more intense - and gifted further with an extended longevity.\"\nIt is the result of extra time of maturation and constantly monitored and tasted by the Chef de cave to determine the perfect time for disgorgement.\nThe first Plénitude is the Dom Perignon released after 8-9 years of lees ageing. The second Plénitude is released after 15 to 20 years lees ageing. P3 is released after considerably more lees ageing and in very small quantities.\n\nLimited editions\nDom Pérignon has over the years collaborated with different artists, profiles and designers to create limited editions of the bottles design. Some of the limited editions are:\n\nStyle\nDom Pérignon is always an assemblage of Pinot noir and Chardonnay grapes, although the final composition changes every vintage: at times a blend in perfectly equal proportions (e.g. 1990 Rosé), at times up to 60% Chardonnay (1982) or 60% Pinot noir (1969), and only once going over 60% (with 65% Chardonnay in 1970). According to Richard Geoffroy's Manifesto and blog: \"Dom Pérignon expresses its first plénitude after seven years in the cellar\", with a second plénitude 12 to 15 years after the vintage (first Œnothèque release, now referred to as P2) and a third plénitude after 30 to 40 years (second Œnothèque release, now referred to as P3). Around 2016, the producer stopped using the Œnothèque designation and started labeling new plénitude releases as P2 or P3, providing more clarity to the disgorgement date than the Œnothèque designation. The grapes entering the blend come from the best, most sunlit sites. Serena Sutcliffe comments: \"With age, Dom Pérignon takes on a totally seductive fresh-toast-and-coffee bouquet, one of the most intriguing scents in Champagne.\"\n\nCurrent production\nThe number of bottles produced in each vintage is not precisely defined, although it is at least 5 million bottles.\nAs of September 2024, the current release of Dom Pérignon is from the 2015 vintage and the current release of Dom Pérignon Rosé is from the 2009 vintage.\n\nAuction market\nDom Pérignon is often traded at wine auctions, where it is frequently termed \"DP\". A wave of auction price records started in 2004, with the sale of the Doris Duke collection at Christie's in New York City. Three bottles of Dom Pérignon 1921 sold for US$24,675. In 2008, two sales held by Acker, Merral & Condit also left their mark on the history of Dom Pérignon, with three magnums of Dom Pérignon Œnothèque (1966, 1973 and 1976) selling for US$93,260 in Hong Kong, and a lot of two bottles of the legendary Dom Pérignon Rosé Vintage 1959 selling for US$84,700 in New York. Only 306 bottles of the 1959 Rosé Vintage were produced, and they were never sold. In 1971, it was served in Persepolis at the lavish festivities celebrating the 2,500th anniversary of the founding of the Persian Empire by Cyrus the Great.\nOn April 17, 2010, a new record was set for a sale of wine in Britain according to The Daily Telegraph. A buyer would have spent more than £35,000 for Methuselah (6 litre) 1996 Dom Perignon Champagne Rose (Rose Gold). This transaction took place at the Westbury Hotel at a party that followed the screening of the new film Boogie Woogie.\nA vertical of Dom Pérignon Rosé Œnothèque, a world premiere release from the reserve cellar of Dom Pérignon, never commercially released before, was sold at a record price at a wine auction organized by Sotheby's in Hong Kong in May 2010. The 30 bottle lot of Dom Pérignon Œnothèque Rosé bottles and magnums from 1966, 1978, 1982, 1985, 1988, and 1990 achieved HK$1,331,000 (US$170,641), setting the world auction record for a single lot of champagne and is the first HK$1 million lot of wine Sotheby's has sold in Hong Kong.\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nStevenson, Tom.

    "title": "Rampenloch",
    "text": "The Rampenloch (German pronunciation: [ˈʁampn̩ˌlɔx]) is a street in the East Westphalian city of Minden in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. For a long time the street consisted almost exclusively of brothels. Today the brothels are gone and the street is to be redeveloped.\nThe history of prostitution in Minden can be traced back to the Middle Ages. The first written records come from this time; it attracted particular attention at the beginning of the 19th century during the Prussian garrison period. The history of prostitution in Minden is so closely interwoven with the history of this street that the ramp hole has become a local synonym for prostitution.\n\nEtymology\nThe etymological origin of the name Rampenloch has not been conclusively clarified. One theory is the root word is a dialect term for tripe or chitterlings from cattle, indicating that in the 15th century the site was a local garbage heap or knackers yard. There is a similarly named Rampendahl in Lemgo.\n\nHistory\nArchitectural history\nThe corner house, 3 Rampenloch, dates from 1802 and has remained almost unchanged to this day. Built as a master bricklayer's house, it illustrates the living and housing conditions at the beginning of the 19th century and is included in the register of historic monuments. The pavement, laid in 1877, has been preserved. The paving, which is now unique in Minden, is also included in the register of historic monuments. It consists of basalt cobbles for the carriageway, sandstone curbs and clinker brick walkways. From 1908, several prostitutes have been recorded as house owners. After the eastern entrance to the Rampenloch was closed with a wall in around 1960, the street is now only accessible from the Königswall.\n\nDisreputable location\nThe Rampenloch, which used to lie outside the city limits, has always been considered a disreputable place that was avoided by the population. In the Middle Ages there was a cemetery for women who had been sentenced to death for child murder. Child murder was relatively widespread at the time, because of the stigmatisation and rejection by society of unmarried mothers. The death penalty was applied for infanticide. As the women were considered too dishonourable for a funeral in a conventional cemetery, they were buried outside the city, mostly in places that were already stigmatised and used for other disposals. Since the time of the Reformation, a public rubbish tip has been documented at the site, from which time the name probably dates. A street which was a settlement for the poor had formed in the 16th century. Residents who were not allowed to live within the city walls due to poverty, illness or for the exercise of dishonourable professions had probably settled there.\n\nMinden as a garrison town\nOn November 13, 1806 Minden was occupied by French troops and incorporated into the French Kingdom of Westphalia, where it remained until 1813 when Napoleon I was defeated in the Battle of Minden.\nDuring the term of office of the first Minden district administrator in Arnim (1816–1820), the Minden fortress was rebuilt under the supervision of the government of the Minden district. Since Minden was a fortress city, there were a lot of soldiers stationed there, far from their families, which meant that prostitution flourished. Many of the women involved had no other way of making a living. The urban population had become impoverishment which was a consequence of the long occupation by the French, who had imposed economic and social restrictions and sanctions on the local population. Prostitution was the only way for some sections of the female population to avoid complete impoverishment of their families. Lack of education, broken family relationships and illegitimate origins were, according to contemporary statements, factors that made social advancement impossible at that time.\n\nSpread of sexually transmitted diseases\nThe dominant form of prostitution was street prostitution; there was no official brothel in the Minden fortress at that time. This became a serious problem for the army as venereal diseases spread. In autumn 1817, 15 soldiers in the Fusilier Battalion alone had contracted venereal diseases. The Minden fortress commander, Major General Ernst Michael von Schwichow, was commissioned with the redesign of Minden's defences. He was in charge of the resulting works, such as the rebuilding of the city fortress, which included the demolition of barracks and the quartering of troops. Since the control of hygiene and the supervision of troop's health also fell within his area of responsibility, his military doctors informed him about the increased infection rate with venereal diseases. Schwichow took the spread of the disease very seriously and soon identified uncontrolled prostitution as the main source of the infection. Unlike the common \"moral\" way of thinking at the time in dealing with sexuality and its consequences, Schwichow approached things more constructively. According to his theory, the only sensible way to stop the infections, or to bring them down to a tolerable level, was the official determination of the source of the infection - the prostitutes - and their healing, not just that of the soldiers and the city should bear the costs. On November 3, 1817, Schwichow's order was issued that every infected soldier must reveal the place and person by which they were infected:\n\nIf he cannot or does not want to indicate this, he should be courageous, but severely punished after recovery.\nA lawsuit against a prostitute caused a sensation in nearby Paderborn : On 13 June 1817, in the Paderborn Royal Higher Regional Court, a case was brought against the 17-year-old prostitute, Caroline Klütemeyer, for “ corner prostitution ”, and a day labourer, Wilhelm Heidemann, for tolerating a \"whores economy\" in his house (he rented a room for the prostitute to use). However, the court acquitted the accused because it believed that prostitution of \"dissolute women\" was not prohibited as long as it was done under the supervision of the state in the appropriate places.\nSince there was no officially permitted brothel in the Prussian Minden fortress, the Paderborn judgement was understood as an indication to work towards the targeted and controlled establishment of brothels. As a result, Schwichow appealed to the Royal Ministry of the Interior to have a brothel built in Minden, in which prostitutes should work under controlled conditions. The city should also pay for the costs. The request was granted because the Ministry of the Interior was also able to determine that in a garrison town like Minden, full of single soldiers, there was a need to regulate prostitution.\n\nControl of prostitution\nSince street prostitution was to be pushed as out of Minden as far as possible, a brothel should be assigned for the prostitutes. Schwichow arranged for the Minden city council to visit the registered prostitutes on 29 November and to give them a choice: either they continued to work with weekly health inspections, under which they would have to pay for their treatment in the event of a diagnosed illness, or they would be banned and punished. Another requirement was that married prostitutes had to present a permit from their husbands in order to continue working legally.\nThe first brothel was initially a semi-official set-up, as finalising official regulation dragged on until 1823, due to resistance from the population and the district administrator maintaining that a city with under 10,000 inhabitants was too small to have a brothel operation. Finally, on 27 December 1823, the Ministry of the Interior approved an official brothel for soldiers - in view of the need to regulate prostitution in a garrison town. This approval was linked to ministerial criticism of the choice of words by the Minden authority, which Freudenhaus (pleasure house) had taken as the name for a brothel:\n\nIncidentally, I cannot approve of the term \"Freudenhaus\" used by the royal government, because bad things in themselves cannot and should not be ennobled by changing names, nor is the intended name appropriate because brothels are too often the source of long suffering and remorse.\nThe first brothel after the city's decree was not at Rampenloch, contrary to the city legends of Minden, but at Heidemann House No. 575 and later Königswall 87, and these were used for prostitution between 1817 and 1846. After the innkeeper's death, the premises on Königswall closed in 1846. In the period that followed, the Minden brothel frequently changed its locations before prostitutes settled at the Rampenloch. There were also brothels at Deichhof and again at Königswall from 1900 to 1910, and also in Soodgasse and Weingarten. However, street prostitution only briefly decreased as a result of the brothels opening.\nThe closure of the brothels was considered in 1839/1840. Military doctors claimed a significantly lower number of sexually ill patients since the brothel was built: 46 cases in four years. The regimental doctor of 15 Infantry Regiment attributed this on the one hand to the morality of some soldiers, but also referred to the opposite: When the unit was stationed in Wesel, where there were three \"mean and cheap\" brothels, 22 men were infected in three months. The Minden brothels remained, however, and moved into Rampenloch at the end of the 19th century, which was then considered a street of prostitution.\n\nModern times\nFollowing World War II, the British Army of the Rhine was established in 1945 and Minden was in British Occupation Zone and it became one of the barrack towns of the BAOR. \nInitially there was a non-fraternisation policy imposed on the soldiers. The War Office notably published that German women \"will be willing, if they can get the chance, to make themselves cheap for what they can get out of you\" in its handbook distributed to soldiers stationed in Germany. In spite of the ban, soldiers still knowingly had contact with local women. In a report by a British soldier formerly stationed in Germany:\n\n\"We drank in the Company club, sinking as much beer as we could and then in groups made for the perimeter wire of the barracks, avoiding the Provost staff led by Vic HOLE, the Provo Sgt in his black tracksuit. We then made our way into the town avoiding the Redcaps, and then settled in various bars in and near 'Rampenloch strass' until we could drink no more, then attempted to get into the Barracks (By a different route of course) to get an hours kip before Muster parade. We always knew who didn't make the return journey by the numbers being 'Beasted' over at the guardroom the following morning, happy days\"\nField Marshal Bernard Montgomery, Commander-in-chief (C-in-C) of the BAOR, was against the ban, and it was lifted in July 1945.\nThousands of British soldiers were stationed in Minden, some of them in the Simeons barracks which was close to Rampenloch. Until their departure in 1994, British soldiers were the main income of the prostitutes in Rampenloch. At times the soldiers had to queue outside the brothels, some of them spending all of their pay in the street. Any trouble in the street from the soldiers was quickly dealt with by the military police. Some of the women from the street, suitably attired, were invited to the Officer's Mess at the barracks.\nA pupil of the Petershagen high school from 1950 to 1956 recalls his youthful memories of trips to Minden:\n\n[…] What a blast Minden was! That was the world, the big world with all the trimmings, especially the trimmings, the Rampenloch that they only spoke behind their hands, and what had been done there. Even though the pocket money and that 50s tightness only allowed me stolen glances. \nIn 2008, the Rampenloch celebrated its centenary as a brothel street.\n\nDecline, closure and redevelopment\nThe red-light scene in Rampenloch went into a crisis after the British Rhine Army was finally withdrawn in 1994. The last two of brothels closed in 2018 and the City of Minden purchased the properties. The city had previously brought other properties in the street as they became available, as part of the district's urban re-development. As two of the houses are listed and the paving of the street is also listed total redevelopment is not possible. The city's “Living action plan” of 2017, which includes a stock of housing, is expected to form an important basis for the scheme. An initial interest procedure started in January 2020 with concepts submitted to the city's urban planners. A specialist committee will select a preferred concept in November 2020. The successful applicant will then have a year to submit detailed proposals and costings for the full council for approval.\n\nIn the theatre\nA play was dedicated to the brothel street, Rampenloch – er nun wieder, as part of Minden's 1200th anniversary celebrations. The play premiered in 1998 at the Tucholsky theatre in Minden and 17 performances were staged. The play was performed again in 2009 under the title of Rampenloch - ten years after, this time the play was performed on Rampenloch.\n\nSee also\nProstitution in Germany\n\nNotes and references\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\nBronisch, Matthias. \"Roman-u\". gymnasium-petershagen.de (in German).

    "title": "Chemokine",
    "text": "Chemokines (from Ancient Greek  χῠμείᾱ (khumeíā) 'alchemy' and  κῑ́νησῐς (kī́nēsis) 'movement'), or chemotactic cytokines, are a family of small cytokines or signaling proteins secreted by cells that induce directional movement of leukocytes, as well as other cell types, including endothelial and epithelial cells. In addition to playing a major role in the activation of host immune responses, chemokines are important for biological processes, including morphogenesis and wound healing, as well as in the pathogenesis of diseases like cancers.\nCytokine proteins are classified as chemokines according to behavior and structural characteristics. In addition to being known for mediating chemotaxis, chemokines are all approximately 8–10 kilodaltons in mass and have four cysteine residues in conserved locations that are key to forming their 3-dimensional shape.\nThese proteins have historically been known under several other names including the SIS family of cytokines, SIG family of cytokines, SCY family of cytokines, Platelet factor-4 superfamily or intercrines.  Some chemokines are considered pro-inflammatory and can be induced during an immune response to recruit cells of the immune system to a site of infection, while others are considered homeostatic and are involved in controlling the migration of cells during normal processes of tissue maintenance or development.  Chemokines are found in all vertebrates, some viruses and some bacteria, but none have been found in other invertebrates.\nChemokines have been classified into four main subfamilies: CXC, CC, CX3C and C. All of these proteins exert their biological effects by interacting with G protein-linked transmembrane receptors called chemokine receptors, that are selectively found on the surfaces of their target cells.\n\nFunction\nThe major role of chemokines is to act as a chemoattractant to guide the migration of cells.  Cells that are attracted by chemokines follow a signal of increasing chemokine concentration towards the source of the chemokine. Some chemokines control cells of the immune system during processes of immune surveillance, such as directing lymphocytes to the lymph nodes so they can screen for invasion of pathogens by interacting with antigen-presenting cells residing in these tissues.  These are known as homeostatic chemokines and are produced and secreted without any need to stimulate their source cells.  Some chemokines have roles in development; they promote angiogenesis (the growth of new blood vessels), or guide cells to tissues that provide specific signals critical for cellular maturation. Other chemokines are inflammatory and are released from a wide variety of cells in response to bacterial infection, viruses and agents that cause physical damage such as silica or the urate crystals that occur in gout. Their release is often stimulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1.  Inflammatory chemokines function mainly as chemoattractants for leukocytes, recruiting monocytes, neutrophils and other effector cells from the blood to sites of infection or tissue damage. Certain inflammatory chemokines activate cells to initiate an immune response or promote wound healing. They are released by many different cell types and serve to guide cells of both innate immune system and adaptive immune system.\n\nTypes by function\nChemokines are functionally divided into two groups:\n\nHomeostatic: are constitutively produced in certain tissues and are responsible for basal leukocyte migration. These include: CCL14, CCL19, CCL20, CCL21, CCL25, CCL27, CXCL12 and CXCL13. This classification is not strict; for example, CCL20 can act also as pro-inflammatory chemokine.\nInflammatory: these are formed under pathological conditions (on pro-inflammatory stimuli, such as IL-1, TNF-alpha, LPS, or viruses) and actively participate in the inflammatory response attracting immune cells to the site of inflammation. Examples are: CXCL-8, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL11, CXCL10.\n\nHoming\nThe main function of chemokines is to manage the migration of leukocytes (homing) in the respective anatomical locations in inflammatory and homeostatic processes.\nBasal: homeostatic chemokines are basal produced in the thymus and lymphoid tissues. Their homeostatic function in homing is best exemplified by the chemokines CCL19 and CCL21 (expressed within lymph nodes and on lymphatic endothelial cells) and their receptor CCR7 (expressed on cells destined for homing in cells to these organs). Using these ligands is possible routing antigen-presenting cells (APC) to lymph nodes during the adaptive immune response. Among other homeostatic chemokine receptors include: CCR9, CCR10, and CXCR5, which are important as part of the cell addresses for tissue-specific homing of leukocytes. CCR9 supports the migration of leukocytes into the intestine, CCR10 to the skin and CXCR5 supports the migration of B-cell to follicles of lymph nodes. As well CXCL12 (SDF-1) constitutively produced in the bone marrow promotes proliferation of progenitor B cells in the bone marrow microenvironment.\nInflammatory: inflammatory chemokines are produced in high concentrations during infection or injury and determine the migration of inflammatory leukocytes into the damaged area. Typical inflammatory chemokines include: CCL2, CCL3 and CCL5, CXCL1, CXCL2 and CXCL8. A typical example is CXCL-8, which acts as a chemoattractant for neutrophils. In contrast to the homeostatic chemokine receptors, there is significant promiscuity (redundancy) associated with binding receptor and  inflammatory chemokines. This often complicates research on receptor-specific therapeutics in this area.\n\nTypes by cell attracted\nMonocytes / macrophages: the key chemokines that attract these cells to the site of inflammation include: CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CCL7, CCL8, CCL13, CCL17 and CCL22.\nT-lymphocytes: the four key chemokines that are involved in the recruitment of T lymphocytes to the site of inflammation are: CCL2, CCL1, CCL22 and CCL17. Furthermore, CXCR3 expression by T-cells is induced following T-cell activation and activated T-cells are attracted to sites of inflammation where the IFN-y inducible chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11 are secreted.\nMast cells: on their surface express several receptors for chemokines: CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CXCR2, and CXCR4. Ligands of these receptors CCL2 and CCL5 play an important role in mast cell recruitment and activation in the lung. There is also evidence that CXCL8 might be inhibitory of mast cells.\nEosinophils: the migration of eosinophils into various tissues involved several chemokines of CC family: CCL11, CCL24, CCL26, CCL5, CCL7, CCL13, and CCL3. Chemokines CCL11 (eotaxin) and CCL5 (RANTES) acts through a specific receptor CCR3 on the surface of eosinophils, and eotaxin plays an essential role in the initial recruitment of eosinophils into the lesion.\nNeutrophils: are regulated primarily by CXC chemokines. An example CXCL8 (IL-8) is chemoattractant for neutrophils and also activating their metabolic and degranulation.\n\nStructural characteristics\nProteins are classified into the chemokine family based on their structural characteristics, not just their ability to attract cells. All chemokines are small, with a molecular mass of between 8 and 10 kDa, optimally designed to ensure efficient communications. They are approximately 20-50% identical to each other; that is, they share gene sequence and amino acid sequence homology. They all also possess conserved amino acids that are important for creating their 3-dimensional or tertiary structure, such as (in most cases) four cysteines that interact with each other in pairs to create a Greek key shape that is a characteristic of chemokines. Intramolecular disulfide bonds typically join the first to third, and the second to fourth cysteine residues, numbered as they appear in the protein sequence of the chemokine.  Typical chemokine proteins are produced as pro-peptides, beginning with a signal peptide of approximately 20 amino acids that gets cleaved from the active (mature) portion of the molecule during the process of its secretion from the cell.  The first two cysteines, in a chemokine, are situated close together near the N-terminal end of the mature protein, with the third cysteine residing in the centre of the molecule and the fourth close to the C-terminal end.  A loop of approximately ten amino acids follows the first two cysteines and is known as the N-loop.   This is followed by a single-turn helix, called a 310-helix, three β-strands and a C-terminal α-helix.  These helices and strands are connected by turns called 30s, 40s and 50s loops; the third and fourth cysteines are located in the 30s and 50s loops.\n\nTypes by structure\nMembers of the chemokine family are divided into four groups depending on the spacing of their first two cysteine residues. Thus the nomenclature for chemokines is, e.g.: CCL1 for the ligand 1 of the CC-family of chemokines, and CCR1 for its respective receptor.\n\nCC chemokines\nThe CC chemokine (or β-chemokine) proteins have two adjacent cysteines (amino acids), near their amino terminus. \nThere have been at least 27 distinct members of this subgroup reported for mammals, called CC chemokine ligands (CCL)-1 to -28; CCL10 is the same as CCL9. Chemokines of this subfamily usually contain four cysteines (C4-CC chemokines), but a small number of CC chemokines possess six cysteines (C6-CC chemokines). C6-CC chemokines include CCL1, CCL15, CCL21, CCL23 and CCL28. CC chemokines induce the migration of monocytes and other cell types such as NK cells and dendritic cells.\nExamples of CC chemokine include monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1 or CCL2) which induces monocytes to leave the bloodstream and enter the surrounding tissue to become tissue macrophages.\nCCL5 (or RANTES) attracts cells such as T cells, eosinophils and basophils that express the receptor CCR5.\nIncreased CCL11 levels in blood plasma are associated with aging (and reduced neurogenesis) in mice and humans.\n\nCXC chemokines\nThe two N-terminal cysteines of CXC chemokines (or α-chemokines) are separated by one amino acid, represented in this name with an \"X\". There have been 17 different CXC chemokines described in mammals, that are subdivided into two categories, those with a specific amino acid sequence (or motif) of glutamic acid-leucine-arginine (or ELR for short) immediately before the first cysteine of the CXC motif (ELR-positive), and those without an ELR motif (ELR-negative). ELR-positive CXC chemokines specifically induce the migration of neutrophils, and interact with chemokine receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2. An example of an ELR-positive CXC chemokine is interleukin-8 (IL-8), which induces neutrophils to leave the bloodstream and enter into the surrounding tissue. Other CXC chemokines that lack the ELR motif, such as CXCL13, tend to be chemoattractant for lymphocytes. CXC chemokines bind to CXC chemokine receptors, of which seven have been discovered to date, designated CXCR1-7.\n\nC chemokines\nThe third group of chemokines is known as the C chemokines (or γ chemokines), and is unlike all other chemokines in that it has only two cysteines; one N-terminal cysteine and one cysteine downstream. Two chemokines have been described for this subgroup and are called XCL1 (lymphotactin-α) and XCL2 (lymphotactin-β).\n\nCX3C chemokines\nA fourth group has also been discovered and members have three amino acids between the two cysteines and is termed CX3C chemokine (or d-chemokines). The only CX3C chemokine discovered to date is called fractalkine (or CX3CL1). It is both secreted and tethered to the surface of the cell that expresses it, thereby serving as both a chemoattractant and as an adhesion molecule.\n\nReceptors\nChemokine receptors are G protein-coupled receptors containing 7 transmembrane domains that are found on the surface of leukocytes. Approximately 19 different chemokine receptors have been characterized to date, which are divided into four families depending on the type of chemokine they bind; CXCR that bind CXC chemokines, CCR that bind CC chemokines, CX3CR1 that binds the sole CX3C chemokine (CX3CL1), and XCR1 that binds the two XC chemokines (XCL1 and XCL2).  They share many structural features; they are similar in size (with about 350 amino acids), have a short, acidic N-terminal end, seven helical transmembrane domains with three intracellular and three extracellular hydrophilic loops, and an intracellular C-terminus containing serine and threonine residues important for receptor regulation. The first two extracellular loops of chemokine receptors each has a conserved cysteine residue that allow formation of a disulfide bridge between these loops.  G proteins are coupled to the C-terminal end of the chemokine receptor to allow intracellular signaling after receptor activation, while the N-terminal domain of the chemokine receptor determines ligand binding specificity.\n\nSignal transduction\nChemokine receptors associate with G-proteins to transmit cell signals following ligand binding. Activation of G proteins, by chemokine receptors, causes the subsequent activation of an enzyme known as phospholipase C (PLC). PLC cleaves a molecule called phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) into two second messenger molecules known as Inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) that trigger intracellular signaling events; DAG activates another enzyme called protein kinase C (PKC), and IP3 triggers the release of calcium from intracellular stores. These events promote many signaling cascades (such as the MAP kinase pathway) that generate responses like chemotaxis, degranulation, release of superoxide anions and changes in the avidity of cell adhesion molecules called integrins within the cell harbouring the chemokine receptor.\n\nInfection control\nThe discovery that the β chemokines RANTES, MIP (macrophage inflammatory proteins) 1α and 1β (now known as CCL5, CCL3 and CCL4 respectively) suppress HIV-1 provided the initial connection and indicated that these molecules might control infection as part of immune responses in vivo, and that sustained delivery of such inhibitors have the capacity of long-term infection control. The association of chemokine production with antigen-induced proliferative responses, more favorable clinical status in HIV infection, as well as with an uninfected status in subjects at risk for infection suggests a positive role for these molecules in controlling the natural course of HIV infection.\n\nSee also\nParacrine signalling\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nThe cytokine family database – Chemokines at kumamoto-u.ac.jp\nThe correct chemokine nomenclature at rndsystems.com",

    "title": "Gottfried Wilhelm Lehmann",
    "text": "Gottfried Wilhelm Lehmann (23 October 1799 – 21 February 1882) was a German copper engraver and later founder and pastor of the first Baptist congregation in Berlin. Along with Johann Gerhard Oncken and Julius Köbner, together known as the Baptist \"cloverleaf\" (Kleeblatt), he is one of the founding fathers of German Baptists.\n\nLife\nLehmann was born in Hamburg, but was raised in Berlin, where his father Gottfried Arnold Lehmann (1766–1819) had been working since 1800 as a copper engraver. In the hope of one day being able to take over the business of his hitherto childless uncle, he began an apprenticeship as a saddler in his uncle's workshop in Leer, East Frisia. He found contact with a conventicle of young men during these years and attended revivalist edification meetings held in various private homes. His notebook contains a number of names from the circle of friends and members of the Brethren church, including that of the Moravian Brethren preacher Jakob Friedrich Plessing.\nThe hope of taking over his uncle's business fell through for various reasons. Lehmann returned to Berlin and in 1819 began training as an engraver and lithographer under Johann Gottfried Schadow at the Berlin Academy of Arts. His religious home was initially the Bohemian Lutheran congregation in the Bethlehem Church in Berlin's Friedrichstadt, of whose preacher Johannes Jaenicke he made a portrait engraving. Through his wife Maria Johanna Eleonora, née Eichner, whom he married on 26 October 1827, Lehmann became acquainted with the Moravian Brethren, whose worship life also made a great impression on him. He was active in various revivalist associations, including the Hauptverein für christliche Erbauungsschriften in den preußischen Staaten ('Main Association for Christian Edification Writings in the Prussian States'), founded by Samuel Elsner, and as secretary in the temperance association, led by Friedrich Wilhelm Georg Kranichfeld.\nDuring a trip to Leer in 1835, he met Johann Gerhard Oncken in Hamburg, who had just founded the first German Baptist congregation there. After intensive study of the Baptist understanding of baptism and congregationalism, he invited Oncken to Berlin in 1837 and was baptized by him there on Pentecost Sunday. With some of those also baptized by Oncken, he founded the first Prussian Baptist congregation in Berlin and became its pastor and elder. For this purpose he was ordained in England in 1840. After initial difficulties with the authorities, his congregation was sponsored by King Frederick William IV from 1854 at the instigation of Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen, but was not able to obtain corporate rights until 1879.\n\nGottfried Wilhelm Lehmann died in Berlin in 1882 and was given an honorary grave (Ehrengrab) in the Luisenstadt I Evangelical Cemetery in Berlin-Kreuzberg. He had three daughters and four sons, including theologian Joseph Lehmann.\n\nSignificance\nLehmann brought Radical Pietistic piety to the still-young German Baptist movement. Lehmann's influence on community life, hymns and the style of piety of the Baptists is still noticeable today. With his Lutheran view of the sacraments, however, Lehmann was not able to assert himself against Oncken, who had a Calvinist influence.\nThe German Baptists' foreign mission also had its roots in Lehmann. However, Lehmann gained the strongest significance for the young free church by advocating the religious toleration of his church at the highest level. It was not until 1875 that this was enshrined in law in Prussia. The first regional association of German Baptists – the \"Prussian Association\" – can also be traced back to Lehmann's work. This association, founded in 1848, became the model for the national Baptist Union (today: Union of Evangelical Free Churches) founded in 1849.\nTogether with pastor Eduard Kuntze, Lehmann led the founding of the German branch of the Evangelical Alliance in 1851.\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nLuckey, Hans (1939).

    "text": "Nokia PC Suite is a discontinued software package used to establish an interface between Nokia mobile devices and computers that run the Microsoft Windows operating system. Its first release was in 1997, originally called Nokia Data Suite. It was replaced by Nokia Suite and integrated into the Ovi service suite.\n\nFunctionality\nNokia PC Suite can be used to transfer music, photos and applications. It can also be used to send Short Message Service (SMS) messages or act as a modem to connect the computer to the Internet. A mobile phone can be connected by USB, Bluetooth, or infrared.\nSome older Nokia phones lack compatibility with later versions of the PC Suite. The official site supplies a table that matches each phone model with the most recent compatible version.\nThe latest version of Nokia PC Suite also contains several integrated applications, including the File Manager, Application Installer and \"Nokia Communication Centre\" data viewer. PC Suite users can also access on-device features (e.g. battery, memory and call handling), as well as Nokia PC Sync functionality.\n\nHistory\nSome of the earliest devices that worked with Nokia Data Suite were the Nokia 3110, Nokia 6110 and Nokia 8110.\nNokia PC Suite has been unimproved, and was replaced by Nokia's next generation phone suite software, Nokia Suite, which supported other platforms in addition to Windows.\nNokia Suite drops the Lotus Notes client sync support which is present in Nokia PC Suite, instead requiring the user to use Lotus Notes' Traveler software. This must be installed and maintained on the Lotus Notes server; synchronization using PC Suite works from the phone to the user's PC, while synchronization on a phone which has Nokia Suite must use third-party software.\n\nLimitations\nThe backup feature in PC Suite uses a non-documented binary file format (.nbu), which can only be used to restore to a phone through the proprietary client.  This means that the data can only be accessed by doing a restore to a working phone. Third-party programs (either commercial or free) can be used to read the file, but they greatly vary in the amount of information they can retrieve.\n\nNokia PC Sync\nNokia PC Sync allows the user to synchronize contacts, calendar, notes, to-do items, e-mails, bookmarks and files/folders between a supported Nokia mobile phone and:\n\nMicrosoft Outlook 2000-2007 (Outlook 2010 x64 doesn't work with PC Suite at the moment, but its possible to sync via Nokia Suite (tested with 3.1 and E71).

It was possible to lose large parts of user's contacts' address information due to this issue.\n\nNokia Maps\nNokia PC Suite is unable to add or update maps and voices for the Nokia Maps application. This requires Nokia Map Loader or Nokia Suite; both require Microsoft Windows with the .NET Framework installed. However, it is possible to download maps for Nokia Maps without need for Nokia Map Loader or Nokia Suite by pointing a web browser directly to the map files on Nokia's Maps server.\n\nSystem requirements\nAvailable hard disk space: 250 MB (file size approx 25 MB)\nOperating system: Windows 7, Windows Vista and Windows XP Professional or Home (SP2 or higher)\nConnection methods: USB cable, Bluetooth, or Infrared\nSupported Bluetooth stacks (software):\nMicrosoft Windows Bluetooth (included in XP SP2, Vista and 7)\nToshiba Bluetooth stack for Windows XP/2000 v 4.0\nWIDCOMM BTW 1.4, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0\nIVT BlueSoleil Bluetooth stack\nWindows XP/2000 use driver version 1.6.1.4\nNokia Nseries, Eseries, and 3250 phones require driver version 2.1.2.0\n\nRelated products\niNoki - an iPhone app for transfer Nokia PC Suite backup file to iPhone & iPad\nNoki - an explorer for Nokia PC Suite backup file (.nbu, .nfb, .nfc, .arc - sd card backup file and contacts.cdb - symbian contact database format)\n\nReferences\n\n\n== External links ==",

She was born in the city of Wad Medani in east-central Sudan and was educated at the University of Gezira.\n\nEarly life\nRania Ali Musa Mamoun was born in 1979 in Wad Medani, a city in east-central Sudan. She pursued higher education at the University of Gezira, where she developed her interest in literature and writing.\n\nCareer and literary achievements\nAs a journalist, she has been active in both print media and television. In particular, she has edited the culture page of the journal al-Thaqafi, has written a column for the newspaper al-Adwaa and presented a cultural programme on Gezira State TV.\nAs a literary author, Mamoun has published two novels in Arabic, Green Flash (2006) and Son of the Sun (2013), as well as a short story collection Thirteen Months of Sunrise, which was translated into English by Elisabeth Jaquette. Her main characters in Green Flash are Ahmad and Nur, two Sudanese students in Cairo who are suffering from racism and injustice. According to literary critic Xavier Luffin, their discussions deal with themes worrying \"their generation, such as the lack of freedom, the civil war, identity, racism, and unemployment.\"\nSeveral of Mamoun's stories have appeared in English translation, for example in the anthologies The Book of Khartoum (Comma Press, 2016) and Banthology (Comma Press, 2018), as well as in Banipal magazine. The French anthology Nouvelles du Soudan (2010) included her story Histoires de portes (Stories of Doors).\nIn 2009, Mamoun was the recipient of an AFAC (Arab Fund for Arts and Culture) grant, and the following year, she was selected to participate in the second IPAF Nadwa, an annual workshop for young writers of Arabic literature. In his 2019 article about the Top 10 Books about Sudan in The Guardian, Sudanese-born writer Jamal Mahjoub characterised Mamoun's stories about everyday life in modern Khartoum as \"prone to experimentation\".\nCommenting on Mamoun's 2023 collection of poems Something Evergreen Called Life,  translated by British-Syrian writer Yasmine Seale, poet Divya Victor wrote:\n\nLocked out of her country after the Sudanese revolution and locked down in the United States during the early and most devastating phase of the global pandemic, Rania Mamoun speaks to us from the ledge of fear and unceasing uncertainty caused by genocidal and femicidal patriarchy. Yasmine Seale’s exquisite, crystalline translations of these poems sing out from the soundless cavern of vertiginous depression born from the loss of country, the loss of countless loved ones, and the loss of one’s own body: “a stray cat circling / her bearings lost/ forgotten/ like a margin in a book” […] “I am drowning/ without getting wet.”\nSomething Evergreen Called Life was selected by Brittle paper literary magazine as one of the 100 Notable African Books of 2023.\n\nWorks\nGreen Flash, 2006\nSon of the Sun, 2013\nThirteen Months of Sunrise, short stories, translated by Elisabeth Jaquette, 2019\nSomething Evergreen Called Life, poems, translated by Yasmine Seale, 2023\n\nSee also\nSudanese literature\nList of Sudanese writers\nModern Arabic literature\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nMamoun, Rania and Elisabeth Jaquette (Translator) 2019.

    "title": "Islamic Army–Al-Qaeda conflict",
    "text": "The Islamic Army–Al-Qaeda conflict was part of the Iraqi civil war (2006–2008) and the Iraq War that followed the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The conflict was between Pan-Islamist, Salafi jihadist groups affiliated with Al-Qaeda, and Islamist groups made up of Iraqis which leaned more towards Iraqi nationalism and often disagreed with Al-Qaeda's ambitions.\nIn early 2007, one of Iraq's main armed groups had confirmed a split with al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), according to a spokesman for the dissenting organisation. The Islamic Army, however, reached a ceasefire with AQI on 6 June 2007, yet still \"refused to sign on to\" the Islamic State of Iraq.\n\nBackground\nThe initial split between the Islamic Army and Al-Qaeda in Iraq dated back to 2005, with some small reports of splits and even armed clashes. In the summer of 2006 increasing rifts began to open between local Sunni tribes and insurgent groups (including the Islamic Army), and al-Qaeda. The main focus of these rifts was dissatisfaction with Al-Qaeda and its tactics, particularly the heavy and deliberate targeting of civilians by foreign Al-Qaeda fighters.\nIn September 2006, this growing anger led to the establishment of the Anbar Salvation Council by 30 tribes, who then sought US support in fighting Al-Qaeda in Anbar. Using the Al-Anbar Salvation Council as a model, CLCs were armed and trained by the U.S. military to patrol their communities and act as neighborhood watch groups. What began as the Al-Anbar Awakening [Salvation Council] later evolved into the formation of concerned local citizens' groups present in almost every major neighborhood in Baghdad and throughout the provinces.\nIn mid-October 2006, al-Qaeda announced the creation of Islamic State of Iraq (ISI), replacing the Mujahideen Shura Council (MSC) and its al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI).\n\nConflict\nEmergence of conflict\nActual fighting between the various groups had begun by early 2007, with groups fighting Al-Qaeda for control of their local communities. The fighting saw Al-Qaeda targeting groups critical of it, with Al-Qaeda bombing a Sunni mosque in Fallujah in February 2007, and assassinating the leader of the 1920 Revolution Brigade.\nFebruary 2007 also saw Misha'an al-Juburi, who owns a television channel used as a propaganda channel by the IAI, attacking Al-Qaeda in Iraq, particularly over the group's attacks on civilians, rival insurgent groups, and the Iraqi security forces.\n\nAl-Qaeda's conflict with the 1920 Revolution Brigades\nThe 1920 Revolution Brigades announced on 27 March 2007 that its leader, Harith Dhahir Khamis al-Dari, had been killed in an ambush by al-Qaeda in Abu Ghraib. Dari was the nephew of Harith al-Dari, the exiled head of the Muslim Scholars Association. The 1920 Revolution Brigades had allegedly been in talks over working with the Anbar Salvation Council. Dari had long been targeted by Al-Qaeda due to his refusal to pledge allegiance to the ISI Emir, Omar al-Baghdadi.\nFollowing Dari's death the Brigades announced its split into two factions—the 1920 Revolution Brigades and Hamas of Iraq. The break was the result of differing viewpoints on working with the al-Anbar Salvation Council, negotiating with coalition forces and the relationship vis-à-vis Al-Qaeda's Islamic State of Iraq (ISI).\nIn January 2018, an article was published in an Arabic magazine which claimed that al-Qaeda is working with Hezbollah to target these brigades once again. There has also been talk of using them as a training ground for future jihadists.\n\nOpen conflict\nFighting magnified in the Spring of 2007. In early April the Islamic Army severed its ties with ISI after claiming that its members had been threatened by the group. Later in the month, the Islamic Army accused the ISI of killing at least 30 Islamic Army fighters, as well as members of Jamaat Ansar al-Sunna and the Mujahideen Army. In the face of escalating conflict, the Islamic Army called on Osama bin Laden to personally intervene to reign in al-Qaeda in Iraq. In May 2007 the Anbar Salvation Council claimed to have killed Abu Ayyub al-Masri, which was dispelled by an audio tape released by the group in response, which also denied claims of fighting between the various groups. In late May 2007 US forces released dozens of Iraqis who had been tortured by Al-Qaeda as part of its intimidation campaign.\nBy June open gun-battles between the various groups had reached Baghdad.\n\nBreakdown in the ceasefire\nWhilst the Islamic Army and Al-Qaeda had agreed on a ceasefire in June 2007, reports circulated of fighting between the Islamic Army and Al-Qaeda around Samarra in October and November 2007. Coalition forces later claimed the operations involved Iraqi and Coalition personnel, as opposed to the Islamic Army. Some news outlets at the time also reported, despite Islamic Army objections, that the Islamic Army had begun working with the Coalition as part of the wider awakening but such claims were refuted by the Islamic Army many times.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "South Carolina Highway 22",
    "text": "South Carolina Highway 22 (SC 22), also known as the Conway Bypass and Veterans Highway, is a four lane freeway that connects US 501 north of Conway, South Carolina, to US 17 in Myrtle Beach. The road was opened to traffic on May 4, 2001, six months ahead of schedule. It is slated to become part of Interstate 73 in the future. The road largely meets Interstate Highway standards, but in order to support increased Interstate traffic, its shoulders would need to be expanded to standard width.\n\nRoute Description\nHistory\nIn 1994, the original contract with Fluor Daniel called for six lanes from US 17 to SC 905 and four lanes the rest of the way to US 501. This money depended on a one-cent sales tax devoted to road funding, but voters turned that down.\nA bridge was built over the Intracoastal Waterway near Briarcliffe Acres, but it remained the \"Bridge to Nowhere\" for three years because there was no money to build the road. In February 1999, the South Carolina Senate passed a bill naming the bridge for Billy Alford, state highway commissioner from 1990 to 1994 and commission chair in 1993.\nOn February 24, 1999, the South Carolina Department of Transportation Commission approved $95 million to make the bypass four lanes. Two years earlier, since money was short, the bypass had been reduced to two lanes beyond SC 90, though the $291.3 million project had six lanes to SC 31.\nEven with the changes, the road would end up being cheaper than planned because of narrower shoulders and bridges, and more bridges over wetlands.\nOn March 4, 1999, The Joint Bond Review Committee approved selling bonds for the money approved in February. Widening the bridges was considered, since some believed that the road could need six lanes in only a few years.\nIn June 2000, the first section of the Conway Bypass opened 17 months sooner than expected despite flooding from Hurricane Floyd. In November 2000, the section from SC 90 to SC 905, including a 29-foot-high bridge over the Waccamaw River, opened 13 months sooner than planned. The final section opened with a ribbon cutting ceremony in May 2001.\nIn 2003, the South Carolina General Assembly approved a resolution asking that the Conway Bypass be designated I-73.\n\nFuture\nSouthern Evacuation Lifeline\nThe Horry County road plans RIDE III and RIDE IV are providing funding for the Southern Evacuation Lifeline (SELL), a proposed 28-mile (45 km) limited-access highway which would start at the western terminus of SC 22 with US 501 and allow a more direct route west from the southern Strand, while simultaneously, along with SC 22, completing a beltway around the Myrtle Beach area.\n\nInterstate 73\nSouth Carolina Highway 22 is slated to be upgraded to Interstate standards and eventually become the southernmost terminus of Interstate 73 (I-73). I-73 will begin where SC 22 starts at US 17 near Briarcliffe Acres. It will then proceed northwest crossing the proposed routing of I-74 (currently SC 31, the Carolina Bays Parkway). After passing Conway, I-73 will leave SC 22 at a new interchange to be constructed two miles (3.2 km) west of US 701, and will then use a new highway to be built between SC 22 and SC 917 north of Cool Spring. The \"I-73 Intermediate Traffic and Revenue Study\" by C&M Associates, dated February 2016, was to be presented to state transportation officials March 24, 2016 and included upgrades to SC 22. \nInterest in I-73 was renewed in early 2021 due in part to the announcement of the American Jobs Plan. Two years later in September 2023, SCDOT announced that Phase I of the project, which would connect I-95 in Dillon County to US 501 south of Latta, would be \"shovel ready\" by the new year. They also announced that had begun right-of-way purchasing within Horry County from the Little Pee Dee River to the eventual connecting point for I-73 and SC 22.\n\nJunction list\nThe entire route is in Horry County.\n\nSee also\nU.S. roads portal\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\n Media related to South Carolina Highway 22 at Wikimedia Commons\nSC 22 at Virginia Highways' South Carolina Highways Annex",

    "text": "Joseph Lee Bast is an American right-wing political activist. He is the former president and CEO of The Heartland Institute, an American nonprofit conservative and libertarian public policy think tank based in Arlington Heights, Illinois. He retired as president and CEO in July 2017 when former Congressman Tim Huelskamp took over those roles in the organization. Huelskamp was followed as president at Heartland by Frank Lasee in 2019, and then James Taylor in 2020.\n\nBiography\nBast was born on January 22, 1958, in Kimberly, Wisconsin, where he attended a Catholic elementary school. He studied economics at the University of Chicago but dropped out of school in order to devote more time to the Heartland Institute. Bast married Diane Bast, who grew up with him in Kimberly.\nIn 1984, David Padden founded the Heartland Institute — an American conservative and libertarian public policy think tank — and put Bast in charge of the nascent organization. Bast has been president and CEO ever since. \"Personally, I'm a fallen-away libertarian. I place a high value on individual freedom and I tend to look at most issues from that perspective. But I'm not sure it is the only way anymore,\" Bast told the Chicago Tribune in 1995.\nBast is one of the editors of the Climate Change Reconsidered series by the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC). He was also involved in the creation of the State Policy Network, and has written several books, some of which challenge mainstream claims about cigarette smoking. In 2014, he co-authored an article entitled \"The Myth of the Climate Change '97%'\" in the Wall Street Journal along with Roy Spencer which argued that the oft-cited claim that \"97% of the world's scientists believe climate change is an urgent problem\" is misleading because the figure is derived from surveys with small sample sizes, and the questionnaire conflates belief in negligible global warming with belief in dangerous global warming. A 2011 article in Nature criticized his position on global warming and second-hand smoke.\n\nThe Heartland Institute\nAs president of the Heartland Institute, Bast managed the institute's finances, helped organize and introduce its annual conference on climate change, and set its research and communications agenda. Bast was a regular speaker at the Heartland Institute's annual conference on climate change.\nBast and his wife, executive editor Diane Bast, published four monthly public policy newspapers distributed to elected officials: School Reform News, Health Care News, Budget & Tax News, and Environment & Climate News.\nBast told Bloomberg News that the Heartland Institute does not deny climate change, but they are skeptical of the scientific consensus that man-made global warming is a significant danger to the planet. The Heartland Institute also believes that many of the policies to fight global warming would be damaging to the economy. According to Nature, Bast does not necessarily deny that humans are having an influence on the climate, but he does question the forecasts of catastrophic impacts and the rationale for curbing carbon emissions. Bast argues that the costs of trying to prevent global warming exceed the benefits.\nIn a Wall Street Journal interview, Bast said that he believes the climate has warmed in the second half of the 20th century and there is likely a measurable human impact on climate. He believes the human impact on global warming is likely very small and that minimal warming is not a crisis.\nAccording to Bloomberg News, Bast's skepticism of the dangers posed by global warming have made him \"a favorite bogeyman of environmentalists.\" In 2012, Bast signed off on a widely criticized ad campaign that compared global warming believers to the Unabomber.\n\nBibliography\nEco-Sanity: A Common-sense Guide to Environmentalism (1994)\nEducation and Capitalism: How Overcoming Our Fear of Markets and Economics Can Improve America's Schools (2003)\nRewards: How to use rewards to help children learn – and why teachers don't use them well (2014)\nBast, Joseph L (2006).

Sports Arena (Greek: Κλειστό γήπεδο ΠΑΟΚ) is an indoor arena located in Pylaia, Thessaloniki, Greece, and it hosts the men's basketball, women's basketball, men's volleyball and women's volleyball departments of the multi-sports club PAOK.\nPAOK Sports Arena is the largest privately owned arena in Greece. It was opened in 2000, and in the same year, it hosted the EuroLeague and Greek Cup final-fours. It is built on land donated by Ioannis Dedeoglou, for which P.A.O.K. B.C. holds an annual tournament in his honor. It has 8,142 seats for fans and 502 parking spots.\nPAOK's volleyball department had to wait until 2002, to begin using the stadium. The arena also includes a training facility, club offices, shops, and a museum dedicated to PAOK basketball club. The arena was renovated in 2016.\nMost of people usually call the arena \"Palatáki\" (Greek: \"Παλατάκι\", which means \"little palace\"), due to its comforts and modern construction.\n\nDirections to the stadium\nThe arena is located in southeast Thessaloniki, Greece, in the Pylaia borough, 7 km from the city centre, and around 1 km from Thessaloniki's International Airport. The arena lies 300 meters off the junction, on a small hill. OASTH's bus lines #2 (starts from KTEL) and #3 (starts from Thessaloniki railway station) provide public transport to the arena. In the longer term, the stadium will also serve the Thessaloniki Metro with the Anotera Scholi Polemou metro station, which is planned to be near the arena.\n\nConstruction of PAOK Sports Arena\nP.A.O.K. B.C. had to wait 10 years from the laying of the arena's foundations (on March 18, 1990), and 12 years from the time Ioannis Dedeoglou donated the land (June 17, 1988), until the sports arena was complete.\nIoannis and his brother, Thanasis Dedeoglou, first began to think about a new major European sports arena in Thessaloniki in 1991, by donating land to PAOK. A proposal to host the 2000 FIBA EuroLeague Final Four in the new arena, increased the motivation to complete the stadium. FIBA Europe accepted the offer, and the construction was finished in time. The stadium also hosted, earlier that year, the 2000 Greek Cup Final Four, as its first major event.\n\nEvents held\nFirst Ioannis Dedeoglou Tournament\nThe first tournament took place in 2004, and four teams competed. They were Hemofarm, Panathinaikos, PAOK, and Ülker. The first games took place on September 24, 2004, in which Panathinaikos won against Hemofarm, by a score of 83–79, while PAOK beat Ülker, by a score of 77–57. The very next day, Hemofarm vs. Ulker and PAOK vs. Panathinaikos took place, to decide who would earn the final positions. Hemofarm beat Ulker by a score of 84–74, for its third-place finish, and PAOK beat Panathinaikos in a close game, by a score of 79–76, for first place.\n\nSecond Ioannis Dedeoglou Tournament\nThe second tournament was held in September 2005. The teams that participated were AEK, FC Barcelona, Red Star Belgrade, and PAOK. On the first day of the tournament, fans got to see a Greek derby between PAOK and AEK, which PAOK won by a score of 77–72. The next game of the day took place between Barcelona and Red Star, in which Barcelona won 77–67. The following day, AEK was pitted against Red Star, and lost 54–75. The final was a real feast for the eyes, as it finished with both teams tied at 87 points; it was a great game, in which Barcelona ended up beating PAOK, in overtime, by a score of 102–101.\n\n2000 Thessaloniki EuroLeague Final Four\nPAOK Sports Arena hosted the 2000 Thessaloniki FIBA EuroLeague Final Four.\n\nSemifinals\nPanathinikos Athens (GRE) – Efes Pilsen (TUR) 81–71\nMaccabi Tel Aviv (ISR) – FC Barcelona (ESP) 65–51\n\nThird place game\nFC Barcelona (Spain) – Efes Pilsen 69–75 (Turkey)\n\nFinal\nPanathinaikos Athens (Greece) – Maccabi Tel Aviv (Israel) 73–67\n\nCEV Champions League Final Four\nPAOK Sports Arena hosted the 2004–05 CEV Champions League Final Four, which took place from 26 to 27 March 2005.\n\nConcerts\nA number of concerts also take place in the arena.

His parents were Poppo, Count of Berg-Schelklingen, and his wife Sophia, who is sometimes claimed to be a Princess of Hungary – an otherwise unattested daughter of Solomon, King of Hungary and Judith of Swabia, but this is highly unlikely for chronological reasons. The historian Christoph Friedrich von Stälin theorised that their great political power despite humble origins was due to kinship with Bishop St. Otto of Bamberg, who was also Judith's chaplain after her marriage to Władysław I, Duke of Poland, with whom she had a daughter Adelaide, who married Henry's brother-in-law Diepold III, Margrave of Vohburg and gave birth to Adelaide of Vohburg, the first wife of Frederick Barbarossa.\nHenry married around 1090 to Adelaide of Mochental, daughter of Diepold II, Margrave of Vohburg and Liutgard of Carinthia.

She broke the school records for season wins, strikeouts and innings pitched, all remain top-5 marks; her ERA, shutouts and opponents batting average were and continue to be top-10 all-time. The wins are also 10th best for the conference.\nAs a junior, Nelson made the NFCA First Team and was awarded Southeastern Conference Pitcher of The Year. Earning a conference pitching Triple Crown, she also broke her own season records in wins (led NCAA and set the Junior Class record), strikeouts and innings, while her ERA also improved to the top of the school list. Her opponents average, shutouts and strikeout ratio still rank top-10. In the conference her wins, ERA and innings also remain top-10.\nOn February 27, Nelson tied and set a school and career single game record fanning 16 batters vs. the Long Beach State 49ers. Winning pitcher Brooke Turner matched the total for 32 combined strikeouts, a top-10 NCAA record. Beginning on March 13, with an 8-4 victory over the Alabama Crimson Tide, the Gator went on a 26 consecutive game win streak, snapped by the UCF Knights on May 18. Leading her team to a No. 1 seed, the Gators reached the Women's College World Series and responded to an opening loss with three wins to get to the semifinals where they were eventually eliminated by the Texas A&M Aggies on June 2. Nelson was named to the WCWS All-Tournament Team.\nFor a final time Nelson was a NFCA First Team honoree and Southeastern Conference Pitcher of The Year. With a second conference Triple Crown and two no-hitters in tow, she set new school records in season ERA (tops in the NCAA), WHIP and shutouts, which helped her to the all-time season Triple Crown for the school. Her wins, strikeouts, innings, strikeout ratio (career best 8.7) and opponents average are top-5 records. The ERA and wins rank fifth for a Southeastern Conference season.\nIn a February 20 win against the Arizona State Sun Devils, Nelson collected her 100th victory. On April 4-May 3, Nelson achieved a career best 51.1 consecutive scoreless inning streak. She was 11-0 over 12 games (6 complete), whiffing 66 and surrendering 24 hits and 8 walks for a 0.62 WHIP. Later during that streak on April 26 and for one of her no-hitters, she also garnered the 1000th strikeout of her career, defeating the Arkansas Razorbacks. To reach that year's WCWS, she bested the Texas A&M Aggies on May 16 with a 14 strikeout performance in regulation for a career high. Repeating their previous tournament seeding, the team went undefeated in getting to the finals and Nelson pitched two shutouts before suffering back-to-back losses to eventual champions the Washington Huskies, concluding on June 2. She was again named All-Tournament for her efforts.\nNelson would graduate with and maintains the Florida career crown in wins, ERA, shutouts and innings pitched; her strikeouts, opponents average and strikeout ratio are currently top-5 all-time. Additionally, she ranks top-5 in all but the three latter categories for her school's conference. In the NCAA, her wins tie her at sixth place along with several season records.\n\nAwards and honors\n2007 - SEC Academic Honor Roll\n2007 - NFCA All-Southeast Region\n2007 - NFCA/Louisville Slugger All-American second team\n2007 - Easton All-American Pitcher\n2008 - SEC First Team\n2008 - SEC Academic Honor Roll\n2008 - SEC Tournament MVP\n2008 - NFCA All-Southeast Region\n2008 - NFCA/Louisville Slugger All-American first team\n2008 - SEC Player of the Year\n2008 - ESPN The Magazine Academic First-Team All-American\n2008 - Easton All-American Pitcher\n2009 - Top three-finalist for the 2009 USA Softball Collegiate Player of the Year\n2009 - SEC First-Team\n2009 - SEC Academic Honor Roll\n2009 - NFCA/Louisville Slugger All-American first team\n2009 - ESPN The Magazine Academic All-American of the Year\n2009 - SEC Pitcher of the Year\n2009 - Lowe's Senior CLASS Award\n2014 - All-Brazilian Joao Pedro Tournament Champion\n\nLaw School\nNelson attended Loyola Law School from 2011-2014.

    "title": "Sonny Fargo",
    "text": "Jack Lewis Faggart (July 20, 1928 – August 20, 2008) was an American professional wrestler and professional wrestling referee, better known by the ring name Sonny \"Roughhouse\" Fargo. He is best known for his appearances with NWA Mid-America in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nEarly life\nFaggart was born on July 20, 1928, in Rowan County, North Carolina, to Lewis and Delma Swink Faggart. He had two siblings: a brother, Henry (who himself became a wrestler under the ring name Jackie Fargo), and a sister, Kathleen.\n\nProfessional wrestling career\nFaggart was trained by Joe Marshall and Kenny Marshall, debuting in 1950. He wrestled primarily in the Carolinas, Tennessee, and the Gulf Coast. By the late-1950s, he was regularly teaming with his brother Jackie Fargo and with their kayfabe brother Don Fargo as \"The Fabulous Fargos\" in the Tennessee-based NWA Mid-America promotion. In 1960, Sonny and Jackie made several appearances in Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York. In 1962, Fargo briefly held the East Coast Heavyweight Championship in the Massachusetts-based Santos Wrestling Enterprises promotion.\nIn 1963, Fargo was brought into Championship Wrestling from Florida as \"the Assassins' Valet\", the silent masked henchman of the villainous tag team The Assassins. When The Assassins were being overwhelmed during matches, Fargo would revive them with an oxygen mask at ringside. On one occasion, Fargo legitimately stunned Eddie Graham by accidentally hitting him too hard with the oxygen tank.\nIn early 1964, Fargo began wrestling under a mask as \"the Masked Rebel\". In March 1964, he and Jackie Fargo briefly held the NWA Southern Tag Team Championship (Mid-America version). He unmasked the following month.\nFrom 1964 to 1966, Fargo began regularly appearing with the Charlotte, North Carolina–based Jim Crockett Promotions, where his regular opponents included Joe Tomasso. He made occasional further in-ring appearances with Jim Crockett Promotions throughout the late-1960s and early-1970s, but by the mid-1960s had largely transitioned to being a referee for the promotion.\nAfter being absent from NWA Mid-America for several years, from 1968 Fargo began sporadically reappearing under a new persona, taking time off from his refereeing job to wrestle for short stints in Tennessee. Nicknamed \"Roughhouse\" Fargo, he was portrayed as the mentally unstable brother of Jackie Fargo, with the storyline being that Jackie Fargo would check him out of a psychiatric hospital and bring him to the territory when he needed help dealing with heels. The brothers' rivals included The Bounty Hunters, The Garvin Brothers (Ronnie Garvin and Terry Garvin), The Interns, The Von Brauners, and The Bicenntenial Kings (Dennis Condrey and Phil Hickerson). To make his character seem legitimate, Fargo engaged in antics such as eating fans' popcorn, giving nonsensical promos, and attacking his opponents with unlikely weapons such as ice cream cones and ketchup bottles. From 1972 to 1974, Fargo held the NWA Southern Tag Team Championship (Mid-America version) four more times. As Roughhouse Fargo, he was a major draw in the Memphis area.\nFollowing the closure of NWA Mid-America in the late-1970s, Fargo made a handful of appearances with the Continental Wrestling Association. He retired from professional wrestling in 1984. He continued to work as a referee for Jim Crockett Promotions into the 1980s, officiating at major events such as Starrcade 1983, Starrcade 1984, Starrcade 1985, and Starrcade 1986.\nFargo was posthumously inducted into the NWA Wrestling Legends Hall of Heroes in 2009 alongside Jackie and Don Fargo.\n\nProfessional wrestling style and persona\nAs \"Roughhouse\" Fargo, Fargo portrayed a wild, unhinged wrestler who had been committed to Broughton Hospital, a psychiatric hospital in Morganton, North Carolina. His finishing moves were the atomic drop and the forearm smash.\n\nPersonal life and death\nFaggart was married to Delores Tutherow Faggart, who predeceased him in 1999. He had two children: a son, Obie, and a daughter, Debbie. He was the brother of fellow professional wrestler and tag partner Henry \"Jackie Fargo\" Faggart.\nLate in life, Faggart suffered from diabetes, leading to him becoming a double amputee. He died on August 20, 2008.\n\nChampionships and accomplishments\nBig Time Wrestling\nBTW East Coast Heavyweight Championship (1 time)\nBTW World Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with Jackie Fargo\nNWA Mid-America\nNWA Southern Tag Team Championship (Mid-America version) (5 times) - with Jackie Fargo (3 times), Rufus R.

    "title": "Exceller",
    "text": "Exceller (May 12, 1973 – April 7, 1997) is widely considered one of the best horses to race in the United States not to win a year-end championship. Despite his exemplary achievements as a racehorse, and his unique accomplishment in being the only horse to ever defeat two U.S. Triple Crown winners in the same race (and only the second ever to do so in his career), Exceller is now remembered more for the tragic manner of his death and the horse rescue movement it helped inspire.\n\nBackground\nExceller was foaled on May 12, 1973 in Kentucky. Bred by Mrs. Charles W. Engelhard, he was sold as a yearling for approximately $27,000 to Nelson Bunker Hunt. Hunt's advisors figured that a son of European champion stayer Vaguely Noble with long and upright pasterns, would be better suited to European racing and sent him to France.\n\nEuropean racing career\nTrained at first by François Mathet, who had been the trainer for François Dupré, and later by Maurice Zilber, Exceller didn't accomplish much racing as a two-year-old but blossomed as the distances got longer during his three-year-old season. While stablemates Empery and Youth were taking down the French and English Derbys, Exceller won in the grueling Prix Royal-Oak (run at 1 7/8 mile) and the Group 1 Grand Prix de Paris. Shipped to England at age four, he wound up a half-length behind The Minstrel and Orange Bay in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and won the Coronation Cup. Sent to Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Canada, Exceller won the Canadian International.\n\nAmerican racing career\nIn the middle of 1977, Exceller was shipped to California and placed in the care of Charlie Whittingham. At first, Whittingham didn't have high expectations for a horse who walked stiffly on arrival and seemed the worse for wear. However, a little time off and some of Whittingham's expertise soon had Exceller competing and winning against some of the best horses in America.\nAs a five-year-old in 1978, Exceller had his best season on the racecourse, winning 7 of 10 starts, all in top company, on both dirt and turf racetracks. After claiming the Hollywood Gold Cup, Hollywood Invitational Turf Handicap, San Juan Capistrano Handicap, Sunset Handicap, and Oak Tree Invitational Stakes, Exceller had his crowning moment. With Bill Shoemaker in the saddle, he came from 22 lengths back to beat Triple Crown winners Seattle Slew and Affirmed in the Jockey Club Gold Cup. Affirmed's saddle had slipped, effectively taking him out of the race, and Seattle Slew had hung up almost suicidal fractions on the lead, but Exceller still powered through the Belmont Park mud to win by a nose.\nExceller came back again at age six and managed some placings, but was not quite the same horse.\nIn sum, he had won 15 of 33 starts, including 13 stakes races, and placed in 11 more in France, England, Canada, and the United States and had earned $1,654,003. He and Noor were the only horses in history to defeat two U.S. Triple Crown winners, and Exceller was the only one to pull off this feat in a single race. Most racing writers agree that, along with Gallant Man and Lure, he may have been the best horse to race in the United States and not win a year-end championship.\nExceller ran best, like many European horses, \"covered up\"—deep in the pack early. In the late stages of the race he produced a powerful burst of speed and caught the leaders in the stretch. His final quarter mile times are notable because he regularly sprinted this distance in under 25 seconds. His fractions of 23 2/5 seconds at the end of the Hollywood Gold Cup and Oak Tree Invitational is very fast, as 23 seconds is considered a quick first quarter in such a race.\n\nStud career\nExceller was syndicated and retired to stud at Gainesway Farm in Lexington, Kentucky for the 1980 breeding season. He shared a small stallion barn with his sire Vaguely Noble and classic-winning champion stablemate, Youth. In 1986 (and probably before), he stood for a $50,000 stud fee, the second-highest listed fee at Gainesway at the time.\nAs time went on, however, it became obvious that Exceller was never going to be a leading sire. By 1991, his stud fee had plummeted to $2,500.\n\nDeath\nIn 1991, the syndicate was bought out by a breeder from Sweden and Exceller was shipped back across the Atlantic Ocean. He sired a few crops of foals, then was diagnosed with a mysterious infection that forced his removal from stud service for several years. When Exceller's owner went bankrupt, the horse was moved to a small farm where he remained for a year before owner Göte Östlund ordered him killed. He was taken to a slaughterhouse and killed for meat on April 7, 1997. According to the woman who tended him- and whose duty it became to kill him- and the Scandinavian Racing Bureau, he wasn't destroyed due to illness or injury, but because he became a liability to his bankrupt owner Göte Östlund.\n\nLegacy\nExceller left behind 16 crops of foals in the United States, including 19 stakes winners and 40 stakes horses, none of them of his quality. His runners were headed by the fillies Slew's Exceller and Squan Song.\nExceller was elected to the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1999. Although the museum's website mentions the manner of his death, his plaque in the museum does not, stating  only that he died in 1997. His fate, essentially unheard of for an American stallion of his racing class, generated debate over the proper treatment of race horses after their careers on the track were over.\nToday, a number of grassroots organizations, such as The Exceller Fund, ReRun, The Communication Alliance to Network Thoroughbred Ex-Racehorses (CANTER), and Old Friends, among others, take inspiration from Exceller's story as they work to purchase and retrain former racehorses for new careers. In addition, had the horse been in the United States, he may well have been given a proper home at the Kentucky Horse Park's Hall of Champions in Lexington as was done after the retired champion thoroughbred Cigar was found to be infertile at stud. Or, the owner might have been able to have handed him over to the Thoroughbred Retirement Foundation in Shrewsbury, New Jersey, the world's largest and most respected organization devoted to equine rescue.\nLike Exceller, Kentucky Derby winner Ferdinand ended up in a  slaughterhouse in Japan in 2002.\nIn the Blood-Horse magazine ranking of the top 100 U.S. thoroughbred champions of the 20th century, Exceller was ranked #96.\n\nPedigree\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "Lizzie Newton: Victorian Mysteries",
    "text": "Lady Detective, published in English as Lizzie Newton: Victorian Mysteries, is a Korean manhwa series, written by Hey-jin Jeon and drawn by Ki-ha Lee. It began serialization in 2011 in Daiwon C.I. Issue manhwa magazine. The series revolves around the title character, a young woman from Victorian England who works as a mystery author, who also solves real-life mysteries and crimes. The series is set in the same fictional universe as the Sherlock Holmes stories, but in an earlier period, so Holmes is still a boy, and other Holmes characters appear as younger versions of themselves in the story.\n\nPlot\nSet in London in 1864, the stories centre on the adventures of Elizabeth \"Lizzie\" Newton. She works as an author, writing the popular mystery series McMorning, Private Tutor and Sleuth for Gentlemen's Own magazine under the male pseudonym of Logica Docens. Other than writing, her passions are collecting books (extending the library of her late father) and conducting chemical experiments. Her close friends and family however, believe that she would better off settling down and marrying her long-term fiancé Edwin White. White works as steward to Lizzie to be closer to her, but before doing so he was a master barrister, nicknamed \"The White Devil of the Courtroom\".\nThe series revolves around Lizzie and Edwin, as they come into contact with various crimes and mysteries during their work, and try to solve the cases. Much of the drama in the series involves other characters, usually male, and their sexist treatment toward Lizzie. Amongst these characters include Inspector Charles B. Gray, reportedly the most competent policeman in the police force, and Andrew R. Kenneth, the president of Gentlemen's Own who gets annoyed by Lizzie's behaviour.\n\nSetting\nLizzie Newton: Victorian Mysteries is set in the same universe as the Sherlock Holmes stories, but in the year 1864, at which point, Jeon writes: \"Holmes is still just a boy here because this story takes place seventeen years before Holmes and Watson would live together on Baker Street.\"\nSeveral Sherlock Holmes characters make appearances in the series as younger versions of themselves. In the first volume of strips, Inspector Lestrade appears an officer working alongside Inspector Gray. In the second volume, Professor Moriarty appears as a student and is mostly referred to by his first name James.\n\nReception\nReviews of the series have ranged from positive to mixed. Heart of Manga have the series a four out of five rating saying: \"Mystery and romance, attractive artwork, and well developed characters make this volume a highly entertaining read\", and, \"While the mystery in the first volume is a rather simple one, Lizzie and Edwin are able to prove the case using scientific evidence.\"\nIan Wolf, writing for the British MyM magazine gave a mixed review writing that, \"It could be argued that the story is rich in clichés\", and, \"The dialogue is a bit odd in places\", but also that, \"The art is rather good though.\"\nBrigid Alverson for MTV Geek gave a mixed review to the first volume writing: \"The story is set in 1864 among the British upper crust, and it makes the most of both the period setting and Victorian attitudes toward women. In fact, it leans way too hard on those attitudes, presenting Lizzie as a smart, independent woman who spends so much time fuming at her sexist contemporaries that it takes away from the story at hand. ... It would be nice to see this series evolve into a good mystery series, rather than stay on the shallow level of the spunky girl who rebels at the society she lives in.\"\nA review of the series for the Anime News Network by Rebecca Silverman gave it an \"A−\" grading, but wrote critically about the use of clothing in the first volume saying: \"Ki-ha Lee's artwork fits almost seamlessly into the world that Hey-jin Jeon evokes. Backgrounds and buildings look appropriately Victorian, albeit sans the plethora of knickknacks popular at the time. (But what a pain to draw, yes?) Clothing has a little more trouble. While Lizzie and the other upper class ladies wear the bell-shaped skirt popular at the time, lady's maid Jane's clothing is from the 1890s. With the skirt widths being so drastically different between the two decades, this is distracting. On the plus side, Lizzie moves as if she is wearing a corset, never bending from the waist and even crouching with her knees out to the sides. Another nice touch is that Lee occasionally uses portraits and photos from the Victorian era when discussing people or developments from history, reminding us that this story takes place in the real world rather than a facsimile thereof.\"\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nAuthor(Hey-jin Jeon)'s official website (in Korean)\nAuthor(Ki-ha Lee)'s official website (in Korean)",

    "title": "Runaway 2: The Dream of the Turtle",
    "text": "Runaway 2: The Dream of the Turtle is a 2006 graphic adventure game developed by the Spanish company Pendulo Studios and published by Focus Home Interactive. The sequel to Runaway: A Road Adventure, it follows protagonists Brian Basco and Gina Timmins as their vacation in Hawaii goes awry, sweeping up the two of them into a secret project by the United States military. The player controls Brian and explores the game world while collecting items, solving puzzles and interacting with non-player characters.\nThe game had begun preproduction at Pendulo Studios by early 2003. Runaway was a commercial hit for the company and saved it from bankruptcy, and Pendulo rehired much of its lost staff for the sequel. New employee Josué Monchan wrote the game in collaboration with project lead Ramón Hernáez. The project's scope grew ambitious and it was beset by numerous delays. It first launched in France in fall 2006. Originally a computer game, Runaway 2 was later ported to iOS, the Nintendo DS and the Wii.\nRunaway 2 received mixed reviews upon release, the worst for a Pendulo title at the time. Monchan later called it the studio's worst-ever game, and said that the team heavily revised its development process for the third Runaway game, Runaway: A Twist of Fate (2009).\n\nGameplay\nRunaway 2: The Dream of the Turtle is a graphic adventure game controlled with a point-and-click interface.\n\nPlot\nRunaway 2: The Dream of the Turtle picks up after Runaway: A Road Adventure, as protagonists Brian Basco and Gina Timmins go on the run with $20 million. Much of Runaway 2 takes place in flashback sequences, narrated by Brian via instant messages to his hacker friend Sushi Douglas. The story begins when Brian and Gina's vacation in Hawaii goes awry: during a plane ride, their pilot experiences health problems over Mala Island. Brian pushes Gina out of the plane with the only parachute and then crash lands in the island's jungles. A sniper seemingly shoots Gina with a tranquilizer dart as she falls; her parachute sinks into a lake. Brian awakens aboard the plane and finds that the pilot has vanished. Exiting the jungle, Brian stumbles across an American military camp near the lake in which Gina had landed. He meets with the soldiers' leader, Colonel Kordsmeier, who refuses to provide information about the parachute or the military's presence.\nBrian investigates Mala Island for clues. Most of the civilian population has been evacuated by the military, but a few remain: Lokelani, a barmaid and former theatrical makeup artist; surfers Knife and Kai; and Joshua, a man who claims to have returned from an alien abduction to the planet Trantor. Brian also meets a soldier named Zachariah O'Connor who—believing Brian to be an undercover superior—reveals his assignment to escort an Afro-French scientist named Pignon to Kordsmeier's camp. Lokelani and Brian have sex, after which she uses her skills with makeup to disguise him as Pignon. Brian's disguise fools both O'Connor and Kordsmeier, and he is taken to a secured Tiki temple to activate a device called the A.M.E.B.A. Unable to look for Gina because of the military presence, Brian inspects the A.M.E.B.A. and learns that it is a teleportation device. At the same time, Brian finds a secret chamber guarded by special operatives under the command of a ruthless woman named Tarantula. He eavesdrops on Kordsmeier and Tarantula, discovering that the two are collaborators and that they have finally seen through his disguise. Brian uses the A.M.E.B.A. to reach the beaches of Mala Island and meet with Joshua, who claims that the Trantorians are behind the teleportation technology.\nBrian and Joshua flee in a motorboat: Joshua believes that he is on a mission from the Trantorians, and must speak with a reclusive scientist named Professor Simon in Alaska. Outside the professor's walled compound, Joshua eats poisonous berries and forgets the password to enter. Brian searches the area and meets bear specialist Ben Wazowski and the violent, condescending Archibald. With help from the two men, he prepares a dish of sushi that counteracts the berries and restores Joshua's memory. Brian and Joshua meet with Professor Simon, who explains that the Trantorians are a scientifically advanced alien race that communicates via telepathy. Kordsmeier seeks to use their technology as a weapon. To force the aliens into complying, Kordsmeier is holding hostage a substance called Trantonite, to which the Trantorians have a special bond. Brian learns that a cache of Trantonite hidden in Palenque—left behind when aliens contacted mankind in antiquity—could ease Kordsmeier's leverage over the Trantorians. Tarantula and her men arrive to assassinate Professor Simon on Kordsmeier's orders, but Brian and Joshua escape, leaving the scientist behind. Brian's instant-message conversation with Sushi is cut short by Tarantula's attack.\nAfter he escapes, Brian wakes up on Sushi's yacht with no memory of his arrival, as a side-effect of party drugs given to him by Sushi's friend Rutger. He learns that Sushi had gone to Palenque while he was unconscious, only to find that the Trantonite had been stolen centuries before by a pirate named Malantùnez, who had subsequently disappeared. Sushi and her friends help Brian locate Malantùnez's shipwreck and dive for the Trantonite, but he is knocked unconscious by a falling timber underwater. He dreams that he is a captive named \"Brushian\" aboard Malantùnez's ship. Characters from throughout the game and Runaway: A Road Adventure appear in new guises, and Brian eventually locates the Trantonite. After waking up on Sushi's yacht, rescued by a crewmember, Brian knows the Trantonite's location and obtains it on his next dive. The crew prepares to return to Mala Island, deliver the Trantonite to the Trantorians and rescue Gina. Having survived Tarantula's attack, Professor Simon reappears and promises to help. The game ends on a cliffhanger as the crew approaches Mala Island.\n\nDevelopment\nFollowing the international launch of Runaway: A Road Adventure, Pendulo Studios began to plan a sequel. The team had spent a year in a legal battle for Runaway's rights with Dinamic Multimedia, its bankrupt publisher, during which Pendulo had laid off almost its entire staff. After procuring the rights in mid-2002, the team had launched Runaway worldwide to great success, and Pendulo's Rafael Latiegui said that the team \"wanted to immediately get [into] a video game\" again. He noted that a sequel was the \"quickest way\" because of the groundwork already laid: Runaway had not been developed with a sequel in mind, but a large number of unused ideas nevertheless remained after the first game's release. In January 2003, PC Games reported that Runaway 2 was under consideration and had been partly storyboarded, but that it was not yet greenlit. According to Latiegui, Pendulo was waiting for the rest of the game's global returns before committing to a new title. The first game's commercial performance, combined with the team's desire to explore Runaway further, ultimately became a key inspiration to greenlight a sequel.\nRunaway 2 was first announced by DTP Entertainment in August 2003, at the Games Convention in Leipzig. By that time, the game had passed the initial concepting phase and its plot was finished. Runaway 2's subtitle was revealed as The Dream of the Turtle in October 2004. For Runaway 2, Pendulo rehired the \"vast majority\" of those laid off due to the Dinamic turmoil, according to Rafael Latiegui.\nDiscussing Brian's change in appearance and personality in Runaway 2, Latiegui said that the team intended him to lose control of his life following the events of Runaway. The team had considered early in the process that Brian might discover himself to be gay in Runaway 2, according to Ramón Hernáez, to create a situation \"such that he does not really know who he is anymore.\" Latiegui said of the final story in Runaway 2: \"He very much tries to prove himself with his [new] look. He has gained a more realistic view of the world but, deep down, he is not a very commendable person. In the first game, Brian had a lot of principles and he lost a lot along the way.\" Hinting in 2007 at the story of Runaway 2's potential sequel, Latiegui said that \"we will probably soon see a Brian who may have changed too quickly and he doesn't feel comfortable with himself.\"\nPendulo opted to use an upgraded version of the same game engine from the first title, which had itself used an upgrade of the Hollywood Monsters engine. The project was initially scheduled for late 2004. Because of Runaway's high profits, Pendulo was able to put its own money into Runaway 2, although most of the game's funding was derived from French investments. The company held a contest to add the likeness of a player of Runaway to Runaway 2 as a character, resulting in Camille, based on a French fan.\nRunaway 2 underwent numerous delays, first to mid-2005 and then to late 2005, spring 2006 and September 2006. Discussing these setbacks at the time, Latiegui argued that it was \"important for the quality of development\" to take precedence over deadlines. Runaway 2 received an international release roughly 8 months before its mid-2007 Spanish launch.\n\nRelease and sales\nOn the week ending November 19, 2006, Runaway 2 debuted at #4 on France's GfK-SELL sales charts for computer games. It placed second and sixth the following two weeks, respectively, before exiting the top 10 from December 4 through December 17. However, the game returned to #9 on the charts during the week ending December 24. Combined sales of Runaway 2 and its predecessor had reached 250,000 units in France alone by April 2009.\nRunaway 2's computer version received a \"Gold\" certification from the Asociación Española de Distribuidores y Editores de Software de Entretenimiento (aDeSe), for sales of at least 40,000 units in Spain.\nWorldwide, Runaway 2 and its predecessor together sold one million copies by April 2009. According to ABC, the Runaway series as a whole—including Runaway: A Twist of Fate—had risen to 1.5 million units sold worldwide by March 2010.\n\nReception\nRunaway 2's original computer release received \"mixed or average reviews\", according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Josué Monchan of Pendulo Studios noted that the game was widely disliked by reviewers.\n\nPorts\nLike its computer version, Runaway 2's ports received \"mixed or average\" reviews, according to Metacritic.\n\nLegacy\nIn retrospect, Pendulo's Josué Monchan called Runaway 2 \"a horrible game\" and \"the biggest shit we've ever made\". He cited his own dialogue writing as a key flaw, as \"comedy is rhythm and [he] had no rhythm.\" In 2019, Monchan stated that he still occasionally returned to Runaway 2's dialogue to learn from his mistakes. He noted that the entire team learned from Runaway 2's poor reception to take feedback into greater consideration for its future titles, which influenced the design of the next Runaway entry. A third Runaway had been considered during Runaway 2's creation, and Pendulo unofficially confirmed that it was under development in November 2006. It received an official announcement at Games Convention in August 2007; certain outlets initially reported that Runaway 3 would be set in Japan and would take place immediately after its predecessor. The game was first shown in February 2008 at the Game Developers Conference, where its name was revealed as Runaway: A Twist of Fate. Pendulo and publisher Focus Home Interactive hoped to attract series newcomers with the numberless title, and Jeux Video reported that the game was \"not the direct follow-up\" to Runaway 2, but a relatively standalone project. Monchan said that Pendulo \"rethought everything\" about adventure game development as it created the game, in hopes of avoiding the mistakes of Runaway 2.\nA new engine was adopted for A Twist of Fate that offered improved graphics, although the game retained a pre-rendered 2D visual style. A Twist of Fate tells the story of Brian's attempt to escape from an insane asylum, where he is detained due to a murder accusation against him. Unlike the first two Runaway entries, the game features Gina as a playable character alongside Brian. A Twist of Fate was first released internationally in November 2009; its Spanish version, again delayed, launched in early 2010.\nPendulo opted to temporarily retire the Runaway franchise after A Twist of Fate, although the team retained ideas for potential sequels. Latiegui explained in 2011, \"After almost a decade with the saga, we needed a break.\" The team reported that it was particularly tired of Brian as a character. Nevertheless, Pendulo undertook a new Runaway title the following year, under the name Hidden Runaway. Unlike Pendulo's earlier work, Hidden Runaway is a hidden object game aimed at casual players. The game was released for iOS devices in October 2012.\n\nSee also\nAnkh: Battle of the Gods\nSo Blonde\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial web page\nOfficial web page (Spanish)\nRunaway 2: The Dream of the Turtle at MobyGames\nRunaway: The Dream of the Turtle - Part 1 (iOS) at MobyGames\nRunaway: The Dream of the Turtle - Part 2 (iOS) at MobyGames",

The Danes will often refer to their traditional districts if asked where they come from, rather than the administrative unit which has been changed several times (last in 2007).\nSome of these districts are nationally known, others more locally. Some of them may vary in their delimitations, while others are based on ancient hundreds and syssels with fixed borders.

    "text": "Joseph Michael Meade (1839 – 14 July 1900) was an Irish businessman and politician.\n\nBiography\nHe was born in Dublin, son of Michael Meade of Great Brunswick Street, a Catholic and founder of the building and contracting firm of Meade, Michael & Son. Joseph entered the family firm and on his father's death in 1866, and took over as head and greatly expanded it. He eventually employed 900 men and was contracted for major projects. \nHe was the chairman of numerous boards including the Hibernian Bank and the Globe insurance company, he used his wealth and position to enhance his civic standing. In 1886 he was elected to Dublin Corporation as alderman for Trinity ward, a position he held until his death, and in 1889 he was made Sheriff of Dublin City.\nA staunch nationalist, he contributed financially to the Home Rule League and after the split in 1890, he remained a supporter of Charles Stewart Parnell. He was elected Lord Mayor of Dublin in 1891, and re-elected the following year – his princely hospitality in the Mansion House was apparently responsible for his popularity. In the 1892 general election he stood as an Irish National League candidate for Stephen's Green constituency and was narrowly defeated by 15 votes by the liberal unionist William Kenny. It was his first and last attempt for a seat in parliament.\nHe died at his home in Dublin on 14 July 1900 and is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery. He was survived by his second wife, Ada Willis.\nAt Meade's death, his property – the bulk of which was in tenements – was valued at £60,000. Nine tenement houses which he owned in Henrietta Street were then auctioned; (including 14 Henrietta Street) these alone had provided him with a gross annual rental of £1,500. In twentieth-century history books he is chiefly remembered as a notorious slum landlord and despoiler of Georgian Dublin; he stripped out original features in the houses he owned and subdivided them. However, he enjoyed a good reputation during his lifetime; his obituaries testify to his geniality, his common sense, and his ability to make friends across the political divide.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "Abkhazian Navy",
    "text": "The Abkhazian Navy is an operational-strategic formation of the Abkhazian Armed Forces, with its headquarters located in the vicinity of Sukhumi lighthouse. Its primary mission is to ensure the security of the self-proclaimed state of Abkhazia on the Black Sea coast. The Navy consists of littoral combat boats, a battalion of marines, parts of coastal troops and special forces. Joint exercises are often held with the Russian Navy.\nOn December 23, 2014, the Parliament of Abkhazia ratified the Treaty on Alliance and Strategic Partnership with the Russian Federation. In accordance with the agreement, the main areas of cooperation are: conducting a coordinated foreign policy and common space of defense and security, promoting socio-economic development, and creating conditions for the full participation of Abkhazia in the post-Soviet era.\n\nHistory and present role\nTensions had long existed between Abkhaz nationalists and ethnic Georgians under Soviet rule, leading to the 1989 Sukhumi riots. In the aftermath of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Abkhazia remained as part of newly-independent Georgia. Tensions over autonomy demands led to the Abkhazian government proclaiming the independence of the region on 23 July 1992. On 14 August, Georgian police and National Guard units were dispatched to restore government control over Abkhazia, which marked the commencement of the war in Abkhazia. On 15 August, a marine tugboat was sent from Novorossiysk, Russia to Ochamchire to tow a decommissioned ship that had been sold to Turkey for scrap. As Georgian forces recaptured Ochamchire, the tug was seized and incorporated into the Georgian Navy.\nTwo days later, a group organized by long-distance navigator Levan Katiba brought a number of vessels across the Gumista River. In Gudauta, the formation of a fleet was organized by Kuchkan Enik, who served from 29 August as head of the coast guard. By order of Colonel Sosnaliev, who was the Chief of Staff of the State Committee for Defense, Enik was given the right to appoint specialists and take sea boats throughout the Gudauta District. In September, Katiba began to form the Navy in the city of Pitsunda from floating seacraft, which at that time were in the hands of local Abkhaz militias. It originally consisted of 25 sailors, with Katiba being the first commander. Abkhaz sailors had a role in blocking the naval communications of the Georgian Armed Forces during the War in Abkhazia (1992–1993). On 20 September 1993, a Tu-154 was shot down from a boat by a gunner of the Atar Battalion. A day later, a Tupolev Tu-134 passenger plane flying from Sochi was shot down over the sea (killing 22 civilians and 5 crew members, including journalists from Russia and the European Union) and the day after, two Tu-154 planes carrying Georgian Special Forces personnel from Tbilisi were shot down by the Ablhaz fleet. The Komsomolets of Abkhazia and Sukhum carried out humanitarian transport to Sochi for Abkhaz refugees as part of a POW exchange program. On 12 November 1992, personnel of the Gudauta Coast Guard Base began to be deployed to the main naval base while transferring a boat and a Project 343ME Volga glider at the same time.\nOn 19 December 1992, Katiba, began to address issues related to the replenishment of equipment, staffing of ships as well as ship documentation and launched a working group to address these needs for the young navy. The interim acting commander of the navy became Raul Nanba, who until then had served as midshipman in the Russian Navy. Raul Nanba resigned from his duties in January 1993. Captain Alexander Voinsky was appointed to this position, with Yuri Achba, a former commander of a nuclear submarine of the Soviet Navy's Northern Fleet, serving as chief of staff. In July of that year, Captain Ali Aliyev, a retired Dagestani graduate of the Caspian Higher Naval School in Baku.\nFurther development of the navy was associated with the purchase of disarmed or decommissioned boats post-Soviet states. the countries of the former USSR. Until 2001, there were 9 fishing trawlers in the Sukhumi Naval Division. Between June and August 2004, the Navy of Abkhazia replenished four artillery boats from the 116th River Ship Brigade (located in Izmail) of the Black Sea Fleet, purchased with funds from the Abkhazian diaspora. In early September 2009, President Sergey Bagapsh ordered the navy \"to destroy\" Georgian Navy ships near the maritime border of Abkhazia. On 23 December 2014, the Parliament of Abkhazia ratified a treaty between Abkhazia and the Russian Federation, which laid the foundation for naval cooperation.\nAs of October 5, 2023, Russia has signed a deal for a permanent naval base on the Abkhazian coast prompting criticism from Georgia.\n\nOrganization\nThe Navy of Abkhazia is divided into three divisions, with the naval headquarters being located in the Sukhumi Lighthouse Area. The main fleet bases are located in Sukhumi, Ochamchire, Pitsunda. The number of sailors in the navy numbers more than 600 people. The composition of the Navy includes:\n\n1st Division (Sukhumi)\n2nd Division (Pitsunda)\n3rd Division (Ochamchire)\nMarine Battalion – It currently consists of 350-400 sailors.\nThree coastal defense batteries *Unguided aircraft rocket installation\nSpecial Unit \"Night Angels\"\nSpecial Unit \"Fighting Swimmers\"\nThree stationary radar installations\n\nCommanders\nLevan Katiba (September–December 1992)\nCaptain 1st Rank Raul Nanba (December 1992-January 1993\nCaptain 1st Rank Aleksander Voinsky (January 1993 – 2001)\nCaptain 1st Rank Zurab Gitsba\nCaptain 1st Rank Aleksander Voinsky (7 July 2005 – 2009)\n\nSee also\n Abkhazia portal\n\n\n== References ==",

He is well known for over 30 years of research on the secondary sexual characteristics of salamanders and more generally on comparative histoanatomy of the urogenital systems of vertebrates. and was recognized as the 2013 Distinguished Herpetologist of the Year by the Herpetologists' League.\n\nEarly life\nA native of Canton, Ohio, Sever was interested in dinosaurs at an early age, but, \"You couldn't find dinosaurs, but you could find lizards and turtles, things that looked like dinosaurs.\" His early exposure to herpetology came from the Boy Scouts, and he is an Eagle Scout.\n\nAcademic career\nSever earned his Ph.D. from Tulane University in 1974 where he studied the secondary sexual characters of plethodontid salamanders under Harold A. Dundee. He worked at his first academic post at Saint Mary's College (Indiana) from 1974 to 2004, serving as chair from 1980 to 1989.  He has been the Department Head of Biological Sciences at Southeastern Louisiana University since 2004.\n\nResearch\nStanley E. Trauth, in his capacity as president of the Herpetologist's League, stated that Sever's research contributions were why he was chosen. \"Early in his studies, Dave's histological research focused primarily on salamander cloacal anatomy and, specifically, the spermatheca or sperm storage structure in these animals,\" said Trauth. \"His numerous papers on these structures have dominated the international literature on this subject for decades,\" and \"I consider Dave to be today's world leading authority on vertebrate reproductive histology\". \"He is without question the foremost histo-herpetologist that has ever lived.\" Sever discovered and described the plethodontid Junaluska salamander (Eurycea junaluska), which lives in the southern Appalachian Mountains.\n\nSelected bibliography\nSever is the author of over 150 books, articles and volumes in over 100 different outlets.

He emigrated to the United States in 1870, settling in New York City.\nThat same year, he launched Di Post, the first Yiddish-language periodical in the United States, using Yiddish type imported from Vilna and Vienna. The publication lasted only six months. Also in 1870, Bernstein founded Ha-Tzofeh be-Eretz ha-Ḥadashah ('The Observer in the New Land'), the first Hebrew-language publication in the United States, which was published weekly for five years.\nBernstein was a frequent contributor to prominent European Hebrew periodicals such as Ha-Maggid, Ha-Lebanon, and Ha-Karmel. Alongside Ch. G. Vidaver, he was among the earliest regular American correspondents to these publications.\nBernstein later became a successful businessman in New York and a patron of the Yiddish theatre. He died in 1907 at the Fairmount Hotel in Tannersville, New York, in the Catskill Mountains.\n\nReferences\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Rosenthal, Herman; Wiernik, Peter (1902). \"Bernstein, Hirsch\".

    "text": "Jean-Pierre Olivier de Sardan (born July 11, 1941) is a French-Nigerien anthropologist. He is Emeritus Professor of Anthropology at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in Marseille. He is also Emeritus Director of Research at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in Paris and associate professor at Abdou Moumouni University in Niamey where he founded the master of socio-anthropology of health.\n\nBackground\nOlivier de Sardan was born in Languedoc on July 11, 1941. He studied political science and anthropology in France during the late 1950s, gaining a Diploma at the Institut d’Études Politiques de Paris (Sciences Po, 1961), Licence in Sociology from the Sorbonne (1963), and in 1967 his PhD (Doctorat de 3e cycle) in anthropology (ethnologie) supervised by R. Bastide. His Doctorat d’état was directed by Jean Rouch, the jury being chaired by Georges Balandier, and awarded in 1982. He was a leading activist against the Vietnam War, and participated in the May 1968 demonstrations in France.\nFor his doctoral work, he studied social change among the Wogo people in Niger, after first being recruited by Jean Rouch to conduct fieldwork with this group over a year in 1965. Over time his close observations of the Songhay-Zarma people have informed other projects, on more general topics, but all grounded in empirical researches in Africa: anthropology of development, medical anthropology, anthropology of bureaucracies, and, more generally, an anthropology of public actions and of the delivery of public and collective goods and services in Africa. He was a pioneer in the use of the anthropological method for the study of public policy and development aid in Africa. Known as an unconventional anthropologist, he had many collaborations with sociologists, historians or political scientists, and has produced innovative concepts such as \"local modes of governance\" and \"practical norms\".\nHe helped found, and was first President of, APAD - the Association Euro-Africaine pour l’Anthropologie du Changement social et du Développement and its journal. He established LASDEL in Niamey (Laboratoire d’études et de recherches sur les dynamiques sociales et le développement local). He obtained citizenship of Niger in 1999.\n\nResearch contributions\nOlivier de Sardan's first fieldwork was a classic anthropological investigation of a particular society, the Wogo along the banks and islands of the Niger River in Western Niger. Several later books describe the language and culture of the broader Songhay-Zarma populations of this region, including their therapeutic practices and former slavery relations. He and the visual anthropologist Jean Rouch are probably the foremost ethnographers of western Niger.\nOlivier de Sardan has also made significant contributions to the understanding of social change and development on African societies, through empirical observation in Niger, Benin, Mali and other countries in Africa (but also including the Lozère region in France). After fifteen years he moved away from classic ethnographic description of small scale society to observe how modernity and western influences are incorporated into, and subverted by, African societies - particularly through public and collective services delivery, and by development aid. In his 1995 book (Olivier de Sardan, 1995, English version 2005) he significantly enhanced the field of anthropology of development, advocating for a \"fundamental\" and non-normative anthropology of development (and not only an \"applied\" one), being attentive to the drifts, unintended effects and implementations gaps of development projects, describing the various perceptions and logics of development 'actors' and stakeholders in Africa and how they related to existing socio-political structures. The techniques of international development aid, especially \"participation\", came under scrutiny and he set out some of the key features of anthropological investigation of development impacts. A further volume (2000) was the first study of development aid \"brokers\" situated between local societies and international aid agencies (Bierschenk, Chauveau & Olivier de Sardan, 2000).\nMore recent work concern local powers and decentralization in the context of stratified societies in Africa (Olivier de Sardan and Tidjani Alou, 2009), political corruption among state actors in cash-starved African contexts (Blundo and Olivier de Sardan, 2006) and the ethnography of elections (Olivier de Sardan, 2015). He has also contributed to insert medical anthropology into health policy and system research (HPSR), analyzing health service delivery in West Africa and the interactions between patients and health workers (Jaffré and Olivier de Sardan 2003), and developing an empirical approach of public health policies in Sahelian countries (Olivier de Sardan & Ridde, 2015). His latest work focuses on African public policies and administrations. He is particularly interested in \"traveling models\" (standardized health and development policies) and their confrontation with local contexts (\"pragmatic contexts\"), a major aspect of which is the \"practical norms\" that regulate the \"non-observant behaviors\" of civil servants, i.e. informal regulations of routine practices that deviate from official norms (De Herdt and Olivier de Sardan, 2015; Olivier de Sardan and Piccoli, 2018). It is also within this framework that he co-edited with Bierschenk a book on \"States at work\". Based on these various works and more generally on the results of the last twenty years of research in Niger and West Africa, he published a major work in 2021: \"La revanche des contextes\" (The revenge of contexts), which analyses in depth the unexpected effects of interventions (carried out to change behaviour and organizations) when confronted with the local contexts in which they are implemented, the complexity of the practical norms of field agents, the diversity of modes of governance that deliver services of general interest, or the tangle of social logics that underlie the practices of actors.\nOlivier de Sardan has also authored a reference book on anthropological method and epistemological issues (2008, translated in English 2015). He has strong views on the need to conduct rigorous and long term fieldwork, and he has developed with Thomas Bierschenk an innovative procedure for team research and collective fieldwork in anthropology (the ECRIS canvas).\n\nHonours\nPrize Ester Boserup, University of Copenhagen, 2014\nChevalier de la légion d'honneur de la République française, 2013\nDoctorate honoris causa, Université de Liège, 2012\nFestschrift volume, published 2007 (Biershenk T, G Blundo, Y Jaffre and M Tidjani Alou (eds.). 2007.

    "title": "Socialist Party of Northern Ireland",
    "text": "The Socialist Party of Northern Ireland, sometimes known as the Northern Ireland Socialist Party, was a small socialist group based in Northern Ireland in the 1930s.\n\nEarly years\nThe group originated in Belfast in 1892 as the Belfast Labour Party (BLP), founded by activists including William Walker and John Murphy.  It became a branch of the British-based Independent Labour Party (ILP) when that organisation was founded in 1893.  Later in the year, the British Trades Union Congress held its annual conference in Belfast, and an ILP fringe meeting was addressed by speakers including Keir Hardie, greatly increasing local party membership.  The local group opposed Irish Home Rule, but were widely attacked by hardline unionists, and as a result largely ceased activities in 1896.  However, Walker and Murphy continued to work together and hold membership of the ILP.\nThe ILP in Belfast was revived in 1906, when new branches were formed in North and Central Belfast, and it quickly grew to have five branches.  Walker remained its leading figure, while William McMullen also became a prominent activist.  James Connolly aimed to win these branches to his own Socialist Party of Ireland (SPI), and he called a unity conference in Dublin in 1912, attended by four of the Belfast ILP groups (the exception being Walker's North Belfast branch).  The branches united with the SPI and the Belfast branch of the British Socialist Party to form the \"Independent Labour Party of Ireland\", although this collapsed soon after the outbreak of World War I, after Connolly was banned from giving speeches alleged to be pro-German in Belfast by the local leadership of the group.  However, the Belfast groups were split in their attitudes to Home Rule, the North Belfast branch being the largest and most strongly loyalist, the Central branch being close to the British Labour Party, and the East Belfast branch remaining supportive of Connolly's republican nationalism.\n\nNorthern Ireland Labour Party\nThe ILP worked closely with the BLP. When the BLP became the Northern Ireland Labour Party (NILP), most ILP members in the city joined, while retaining their ILP membership.  This continued until 1932, when the ILP disaffiliated from the British Labour Party.  The national leadership wished the Belfast branches to similarly disaffiliate from the NILP, but members rejected the idea, and instead split from the ILP to form the Socialist Party of Northern Ireland.  This new body then affiliated to the NILP.  The Socialist Party had around 150 members, and was chaired by Fred McMahon, and later by Sam Haslett.  Other notable members included Jack Macgougan, secretary from 1935 onwards, and Victor Halley.\nThe ILP was based on the Crumlin Road, until its building was burnt down in the 1920s in a presumed sectarian attack.  It received a large sum in compensation, and used part of this to open a new Labour Hall at 48 York Street, which also housed a social club for members.\nThe party was very active in supporting the Republicans during the Spanish Civil War, and McMahon went over to join a medical unit there, alongside Joe Boyd, another Socialist Party member.  In 1937, the party backed the short-lived Irish Democrat newspaper, co-published with the Communist Party of Ireland and the Republican Congress.  The party disappeared soon afterwards; many members, including Macgougan, devoted their time to the NILP, but Halley instead joined the Socialist Republican Party.\n\n\n== References ==",

But in Hari-nāmāmṛta-vyākaraṇa the varṇa-krama is traced back to Lord Nārāyaṇa, who is glorified throughout the Vedic literature as the Supreme Lord. ----[BE1]Between this heading and the first sutra there is a note in course about the format of translation and order of commentaries etc.\nSaṁśodhinī—The Sanskrit word varṇa is most literally translated as a phoneme, or speech-sound. To translate the word varṇa as a letter is erroneous, because a letter is defined as a written or printed symbol employed to represent a speech-sound. The phonemes, having arisen from Nārāyaṇa, are eternal whereas the letters used to represent them may vary. For example, before the introduction of printing into India in the eighteenth century, the script in which Sanskrit was written and taught varied from place to place and was the same, or almost the same as that used in writing the local vernacular language. The dissemination of printed Sanskrit texts, however, encouraged the predominance of one form of writing, the Devanāgarī script of central India in which the modern languages Hindī and Marāṭhī are also written. Today most Sanskrit publications are printed in this [null script][BE1] .\nExplanation of varṇa-krama:\nAccording to MW, varṇa-krama means “order or series of letters, alphabetical arrangement, alphabet.”\nAmṛta explains varṇa-krama as varṇānāṁ kramaḥ kramaśo nirgamanam (“the issuing forth sequentially by the varṇas[1][MA2] ”).\nBāla offers the following explanation: varṇāni udbhūtāni tat-kramaś ca udbhūta ity arthaḥ (“Both the varṇas and their order appeared from Nārāyaṇa”).\n\n[1] Amṛta further explains that the word krama is formed by applying the kṛt pratyaya [gh]a[ṇ] after the dhātu kram[u] pāda-vikṣepe (1P or 4P, “to step, walk”) in bhāve prayoga. Thus the word varṇānām is not sambandha-ṣaṣṭhī here, rather it is the anukta-kartā taking ṣaṣṭhī by kartṛ-karmaṇoḥ ṣaṣṭhī kṛd-yoge (). All of this will become clear in the Kāraka-prakaraṇa.\n[BE1]This samsodhini has one more sentence in course: \" The sounds (varëas) of the Sanskrit alphabet are enumerated below in both Devanägaré script and roman transliteration.\"\n[MA2]reference the sütra in the footnote\nThe sounds (varëas) of the Sanskrit alphabet are enumerated below by showing the letters used to represent them in Devanägaré and roman transliteration.[MA1]\nVåtti[1]—The varëa-krama is as follows:\n\n(Here the @ in @M and @: is just to aid pronunciation, the actual letters are just M and  :)\n\nThese sounds are called varëas, akñaras, or al-s. \n\n[1] The våttis (“fundamental explanations of the sütras”) were also written by Jéva Gosvämé. In the våttis, Jéva Gosvämé clarifies the sütra, gives examples, supplies extra information, and mentions the opinions of other grammarians. The Dhätu-saìgraha (“list of dhätus”) was also composed by Jéva Gosvämé. The Avyaya-çabda-saìgraha (“list of avyayas”), however, is an anonymous appendix, probably composed by Purédäsa, found only in some of the printed editions of the Hari-nämämåta, and the Gaëa-päöha (“list of gaëas”) belongs to Päëini. \n[MA1]Put a sentence like refer to the BBT pronunciation guide ..\nSaàçodhiné—It will be explained in sütra 17 that all the varëas from ka to ha, the consonants of the Sanskrit alphabet, are dependent on the vowels for their pronunciation. That is to say, it is impossible to pronounce a consonant without the aid of a vowel. For this reason all the varëas from ka to ha are listed with an inherent a. But actually these varëas refer to the consonants themselves, regardless of the adjacent vowel. Thus the varëa ka refers to k, the varëa kha to kh, and so on. One should not be confused by the various labels such as “the varëa ka,” ka-räma, ka-kära, and k; they all refer to the same consonant k, never to k+a. This is the case for all the varëas from ka to ha. One should also be careful not to mistake kh, gh, ch, and so on, to be a combination of k+h, g+h, c+h, and so on, because in roman transliteration the h in kh and so on is employed merely to indicate that the varëa is an aspirated consonant. It is impossible for kh and so on to be conjunct consonants since in Sanskrit there are no conjunct consonants that have h as their second member.\nThe varëas from a to au, the vowels of the Sanskrit alphabet, are written differently when they come after a consonant. A, however, has no post-consonantal symbol and is assumed to come after every consonant unless there is another vowel or a viräma in its place. The post consonantal forms of the vowels are shown below with the consonant k to indicate their proper placement.\nk( ka, k(A kä, ik( ki, k(L ké, ku( ku, kU( kü, k{( kå, k|( kè, k}( kÿ, k}{ k ÿ‾, ke( ke, kE( kai, k(Ae ko, k(AE kau.\n\nIn the following special cases the post consonantal symbols of u, ü, and å are put in different places:\n\nç& ru, è& rü, [null ä{\"] [MAD1] då, ô$ hå.\n\nThe viräma ( ,) is a small oblique stroke, placed at the foot of a consonant, that is used to signal the deletion of its inherent a. Thus ak would be written in Devanägaré as @k,(. The symbol called avagraha (') and the various conjunct consonants will be explained in Saàçodhiné 67 and Saàçodhiné 82 respectively. Extra symbols are also employed in the Devanägaré script for the purpose of basic punctuation. For example, the sign / is used at the end of a half-verse or sentence, and the sign // at the end of a verse or paragraph. The numbers of the Devanägaré script are as follows:\n\n[MAD1]maybe use a different font which more accurately represents the character\nPratyähära-sütras\nGenerally the alternate monosyllabic names found in the våttis of the Saàjïä-sandhi-prakaraëa, like the name al here, should be assumed to be pratyähäras from Päëini's Añöädhyäyé. Where this is not the case, we will list the source of the name separately. Pratyähära literally means “withdrawal.” In grammar, however, the term pratyähära refers to the abbreviation of a series of varëas into one syllable by combining the first member with the indicatory letter of the last member. It is said that Lord Çiva revealed the following 14 pratyähära-sütras (often called the Maheçvara-sütras or Çiva-sütras) unto the sage Päëini, author of the famous Añöädhyäyé (literally, “a collection of eight chapters”), by sounding his òamaru drum. All the pratyähäras like al are formed by means of these sütras:\n1. a i u[ë];  2. å ÿ[k];  3. e o[ì];  4. ai au[c];  5. ha ya va ra[ö];  6. la[ë];  7. ïa ma ìa ëa na[m];  8. jha bha[ï];  9. gha òha dha[ñ];  10. ja ba ga òa da[ç];  11. kha pha cha öha tha ca öa ta[v];  12. ka pa[y];  13. ça ña sa[r];  14. ha[l].\nIn these pratyähära-sütras the letters in brackets are indicatory letters, not to be counted among the group of varëas indicated by the pratyähära. And a, i, u, å, and ÿ in the first two sütras stand for both the long and short forms of those vowels--a and ä, i and é, u and ü, å and è, and ÿ and ÿ‾ respectively. The pratyähära al therefore indicates the group of varëas beginning from a in the first pratyähära-sütra and ending with ha, which has the indicatory letter l, in the fourteenth pratyähära-sütra. Thus the pratyähära al indicates the whole alphabet. Similarly The pratyähära ac indicates the group of varëas beginning from a in the first pratyähära-sütra and ending with au, which has the indicatory letter c, in the fourth pratyähära-sütra. Thus the pratyähära ac indicates all the vowels. Other pratyähäras are made in the same way. In these sütras both ha and the indicatory letter ë appears twice. Although this may seem to cause problems, they are resolved as follows: The pratyähära aë is conventionally understood to be formed with the indicatory ë in the first sütra, while the pratyähära ië is conventionally understood to be formed with the indicatory letter ë in the sixth sütra. It was necessary to repeat ha twice in these sütras so that it could be included in such pratyähäras as haç and ië, and at the same time be included in pratyähäras like val, jhal, and çal. In pratyähäras like al and hal where ha appears twice it should not be taken as two separate varëas.[1]\nAlternate readings of the varëa-krama:\n\nIn the Haridäsa edition the viñëucäpa is included in the alphabet as coming after the viñëucakra, but this is unfounded as both commentaries don’t include it and its place of pronunciation is given only later in våtti 15. If it were meant to be included here in the alphabet its place of pronunciation should have been given here in this våtti as was done for all the other members of the alphabet.\n\nIn the Haridäsa, Purédäsa, and Caitanya Maöha editions, which are all based on Bäla, kña is included as the final member of the alphabet. But in the Kåñëadäsa edition, which is based on Amåta, kña is not to be found. Indeed, its absence is confirmed by the following excerpts from the Amåta commentary on this sütra: a-rämädi-ha-rämänto varëa-kramaù (“the alphabet beginning with a and ending with ha”) and varëänäm ekona-païcäçat-prakäratvaà darçitaà (“the alphabet is shown as being 49- fold”). Furthermore, kña is generally not included in the alphabets listed in other Sanskrit Grammars [null also][BE1] .\n\nOn the other hand, Viçvanätha Cakravarté Öhäkura explains in his book Manträrtha-dépikä that Harinämämåta-vyäkaraëa lists fifty varëas in total and that the Rädha-kåñëa-sahasra-näma-stotra of Båhan-Näradéya Puräëa mentions païcäçad-varëa-rüpiëé (“she who is the embodiment of the fifty varëas”) as one of the names of Çrématé Rädhäräëé. Similarly, even though Bäla also says a-rämädi-ha-rämänto varëa-kramaù (“the alphabet beginning with a and ending with ha”), it contains an extra phrase: atra ka-ña-saàyoge kña iti vakñyamäëatve ’pi kña-rämaç ca darçitaù (“Although it will be explained in våtti 17 that kña is the combination of the consonants ka and ña, kña is also shown here”). The ultimate deciding point, however, is that Jéva Gosvämé does list kña in the alphabet when he elaborates upon the varëas in his Krama-sandarbha commentary for Bhägavatam 11.12.17 (see Appendix II). Furthermore, Jéva Gosvämé also uses the word kña-rämasya in sütra 283 which indicates beyond a doubt that kña is considered an additional varëa because according to sütra 37 the word räma could not be added to it as we understand from sütra 37 that the word räma is only used to refer to a varëa. Even though kña is accepted as a varëa in this way, it is not counted as a viñëujana because, in våtti 17, Jéva Gosvämé clearly says ka-kärädayo ha-käräntä varëä viñëujana-nämäno bhavanti [null ...][MAD2]  ka-ña-saàyoge tu kñaù (“The varëas beginning with ka and ending with ha are called viñëujanas. Kña, however, is only the combination of ka and ña”). But even this statement suggests that kña is actually included as the final member of the alphabet, otherwise there would be no need to exclude it from the viñëujanas. Taking these reasons into consideration, we also have included kña as the final member of the alphabet in this edition.\n\nÇréla Prabhupäda also gives an interesting explanation of the name Adhokñaja which supports the inclusion of kña: “And in Sanskrit, as in English it is A to Z, similarly in Sanskrit, a, ä, i, u, and the end is kña. So a and kña, that is called akña. Akña-ja. And ja means generated. So we also compose words, those who are Sanskrit scholars, they compose words from a to kña, just like English they compose words from A to Z. So our mental speculation and advancement of education is limited between this a and kña, akña. Akña-ja. But Kåñëa is adhokñaja. Adhokñaja means where these kinds of speculation, beginning from a to kña, will not act. Therefore His name is Adhokñaja. Adhaù kåta, cut down.” (Lecture on Çrémad-Bhägavatam 1.8.19—Mäyäpura, September 29, 1974).\nAmåta—Someone may wonder, “It was stated that the varëas and their order appeared from Näräyaëa[MA3] [2], but from where did each varëa appear?” To answer this, Jéva Gosvämé specifies each varëa’s place of appearance:\nVåtti—The place of appearance of these varëas is as below and so on[3].\nThe place of appearance of a, ä, ka-varga (ka, kha, ga, gha, ìa), ha, and visarga (ù) is the throat of Näräyaëa.\nThe place of appearance of i, é, ca-varga (ca, cha, ja, jha, ïa), ya, and ça is the palate of Näräyaëa.\nThe place of appearance of u, ü, and pa-varga (pa, pha, ba, bha, ma) is the lips of Näräyaëa.\nThe place of appearance of å, è, öa-varga (öa, öha, òa, òha, ëa), ra, and ña is the top of the palate of Näräyaëa.\nThe place of appearance of ÿ, ÿ‾, ta-varga (ta, tha, da, dha, na), la, and sa is the teeth of Näräyaëa.\nThe place of appearance of e and ai is the throat and the palate of Näräyaëa.\nThe place of appearance of o and au is the throat and the lips of Näräyaëa.\nThe place of appearance of v is the teeth and the lips of Näräyaëa.\nThe place of appearance of anusvära (à) is either the head or nose of Näräyaëa.\nSaàçodhiné—Because the varëas appeared from Näräyaëa in these specific places, these are the proper places to pronounce the varëas. The varëas a, ä, ka-varga (ka, kha, ga, gha, ìa), ha, and visarga (ù) are called kaëöhya because their place of pronunciation is the throat (kaëöha). The varëas i, é, ca-varga (ca, cha, ja, jha, ïa), ya, and ça are called tälavya because their place of pronunciation is the palate (tälu). Other names, also made according to the place of pronunciation, are shown below along with their English equivalents.\n\nAmåta—Explanation of Näräyaëa:\n\n[1] The pratyähäras have been dealt with only briefly in this book; for more details consult Añöädhyäyé or Siddhänta-kaumudé.\n[2] In this sütra Näräyaëa is the apädäna (“origin”) by prabhave tat-sthänam (982), because the eternal varëas, already existing within the Lord, are manifest from Him. The word näräyaëa then becomes näräyaëät as an apädäna takes païcamé (“the fifth case ending”) by apädäne païcamé (981). Here Bäla says Näräyaëa is an apädäna by janane prakåtiù (983), but that is incorrect as the varëas are eternal sounds and thus are not produced at any time. In this regard, Jéva Gosvämé defines the difference between prabhava and janana in våtti by saying prabhavaù prathama-darçanam, jananam utpattir iti bhedaù (“Prabhava is the first sight of something that already exists, while janana is the appearance of something that didn’t exist previously”).\n[3] The meaning of the word ity-ädéni, “these and so on”, at the end of this våtti will be seen in sütras 15, 25, 131, and 132 where further varëas and their places of pronunciation are mentioned.\n\n[BE1]\"Either\" would be better than \"also\" here.\n[MAD2]check with an editor how to use the elypsis\n[MA3]reference the sütras in the footnote\n[BE4]This is not the right aksara.\nHere the word nara (“human”) means a Vraja-väsé (“resident of Våndävana”), and the whole community of Vraja-väsés is called nära. The vigraha (“separation of the constituent words”) of the compound word näräyaëa is: näram ayanam yasya saù näräyaëaù (“Näräyaëa is He whose shelter is the Vraja-väsés”) Thus the word näräyaëa here means Çré Kåñëa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead who appears in a human-like form.\nThis understanding is backed up by the Bhägavatam (10.25.18): tasmän mac-charaëaà goñöhaà / man-näthaà mat-parigraham, where Kåñëa Himself states that the Vraja-väsés are His shelter, His protectors, and His family. In this verse the word goñöham implies the goñöha-väsés, and goñöha-väsés means vraja-väsés because the word goñöha is a synonym of the word vraja[1]. Kåñëa says that the Vraja-väsés are His shelter because He, being controlled by their love, is unable to even bathe, drink, eat, sleep, or enjoy without them. Thus in the Ädi Puräëa Kåñëa tells Arjuna:\nsahäyä guravaù çiñyä\nbhujiñyä bändhaväù striyaù\n\nsatyaà vadämi te pärtha\n\ngopyaù kià me bhavanti na\n\n“The gopés are My assistants, My gurus, My disciples, My maidservants, My relatives, and My consorts. O son of Påthä, I tell you the truth. What aren’t the gopés for Me?”\nEven though the word näräyaëa can be used to express any viñëu-tattva, it primarily refers to Kåñëa, because He is the original Näräyaëa and because the avatäras headed by Matsya and Vämana, and even the three Puruñas are His parts (aìgas). This is corroborated by Lord Brahmä's statement in Bhägavatam (10.14.14):\nnäräyaëas tvaà na hi sarva-dehinäm\n\n ätmäsy adhéçäkhila-loka-säkñé\n\nnäräyaëo ’ìgaà nara-bhü-jaläyanät\n\n tac cäpi satyaà na tavaiva mäyä\n\n“Are You not the original Näräyaëa, O supreme controller, since You are the Soul of every embodied being and the eternal witness of all created realms? Indeed, Lord Näräyaëa is Your expansion, and He is called Näräyaëa because He is the generating source of the primeval water of the universe. He is real, not a product of Your illusory Mäyä.”[MA1]\nIn his commentary on this verse, Çrédhara Svämé gives the following definitions of the name Näräyaëa: näro jéva-samüho ’yanam äçrayo yasya saù (“He whose abode is the aggregate of jévas”), and närasyäyanaà pravåttir yasmät saù (“He from whom the aggregate of jévas arises”). In explaining the phrase näräyaëo ’ìgam in this verse, Çrédhara Svämé gives an alternate etymology of the word näräyaëa for when it is used to refer to the well-known Näräyaëa who is a plenary portion of Kåñëa: naräd udbhütä ye ’rthäç catur-viàçati-tattväni tathä naräj jätaà yaj jalaà tad-ayanäd yo näräyaëa prasiddhaù so ’pi tavaiväìgaà mürtiù (“That Näräyaëa who is well-known because of His entering the twenty-four elements that appeared from Nara and the water that was produced from Nara, is also Your plenary portion[2]”).\nIn his Bhägavatam commentary named Krama-sandarbha, Jéva Gosvämé defines Näräyaëa in the following way: naräëäà dvitéya-tåtéya-puruña-bhedänäà samüho näraà tat-samañöi-rüpaù prathama-puruña eva; tasyäpy ayanaà pravåttir yasmät sa näräyaëaù (“Nära means the first Puruña, Käraëodaka-çäyé Viñëu, the aggregate form of the Naras who are the second and third Puruñas, Garbhodaka-çäyé Viñëu and Kñérodaka-çäyé Viñëu. Näräyaëa is He from whom even Käraëodaka-çäyé Viñëu arises”).\nSaàçodhiné—It is well known that Lord Caitanya often called Advaita Äcärya, the celebrated incarnation of Mahä Viñëu (Käraëodaka-çäyé Viñëu), by the name Näòä. This is recorded both in the Caintanya-bhägavata and in the Caitanya-caritämåta. For example, in Caitanya-bhägavata (Madhya 2.264), Lord Caitanya says “By your loud chanting and Näòä's roaring I left Vaikuëöha and came here with My associates.” In his Gauòéya-bhäñya commentary to this verse, Çréla Bhaktisiddhänta Sarvasvaté Öhäkura explains the word näòä as follows:\n“The editor of Çré Sajjana-toñaëé, Çrémad Bhaktivinoda Öhäkura, has written in Volume 7, Part 11, as follows: “Çréman Mahäprabhu often addressed Çréla Advaita Prabhu as Näòä. I have heard a number of meanings of the word näòä. Some Vaiñëava scholar has said that the word närä refers to Mahä-Viñëu because nära, the total aggregate of all living entities, is situated within Him. Is the word näòä a corruption of the word närä? The people of Räòha-deça often use òa in place of ra. Is this the reason that the word närä has been written as näòä? This meaning is often applicable.” The word nära or närä (näòä) is explained by Çrédhara Svämipäda in his Bhävärtha-dépikä commentary on Çrémad-Bhägavatam (10.14.14) as follows: “The word nära refers to the aggregate of living entities, and the word ayana refers to the shelter. You are Näräyaëa Himself because You are the supreme shelter of all embodied souls. You are Näräyaëa because all the propensities (ayana) of the living entities (nära) emanate from You. You are the supreme Näräyaëa because You know (ayana) all living entities (nära). You are renowned as Näräyaëa because You are the supreme shelter (ayana) of the water that emanates from Nara.” In the småtis it is stated: “All the truths born from Nara are known as närän by the learned scholars. Since the Supreme Lord is the shelter of this närän, learned scholars glorify Him as Näräyaëa.” In the Manu-saàhitä (1.10) it is stated: “The waters are called nära, for they emanate from the Supersoul, Nara. As they are His original resting place (ayana), He is named Näräyaëa.””\n\n[1] See the last sütra of Kådanta-prakaraëa.\n[2] The Näräyaëa referred to here is Garbhodaka-çäyé Viñëu. Garbhodaka-çäyé Viñëu is also called Nara. When Nara entered the universe, He saw that within the universe there was only darkness and space, without a resting place. Thus He filled half of the universe with water from His own perspiration and laid Himself down on the same water. Because this water in the form of perspiration was produced from Nara, it is called Nära, and because Nara lies down on this water he is called Näräyaëa (“One whose resting place is the water called Nära”).\n\n[MA1]we can use the CC translation of this if it is more suitable\n\nBook Published\n[ Śrī Harināmāmṛta Vyākaraṇam by Jīva; Gosvāmī; in English by Matsya Avatar Das; Publisher: Rasabihari Lal and Sons 2017]\nŚrī Harināmāmṛta Vyākaraṇam by Jīva; Gosvāmī; Edited by Rāsvihārī Sānkhyatīrtha; Publisher: Murshidabad Rāmdeva Miśra 1910\nŚrī Harināmāmṛta Vyākaraṇam by Jīva Gosvāmī; Edited by Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī; Publisher: Dhaka Śacīnāth Raya Caudhurī 1947\nŚrī Harināmāmṛta Vyākaraṇam by Jīva Gosvāmī; Edited by Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī; Bala-toshani Commentary; Commentator: Sri Hare Krishna Acharya\nŚrī Harināmāmṛta Vyākaraṇam comm.

    "title": "Biochemical Society",
    "text": "The Biochemical Society is a learned society in the United Kingdom in the field of biochemistry, including all the cellular and molecular biosciences. It was founded in 1911 and acquired the existing Biochemical Journal the following year. The society additionally publishes the journals Clinical Science and Biochemical Society Transactions via its publishing arm, Portland Press. It awards the Colworth Medal and formerly awarded the CIBA Medal (Novartis Medal). As of 2024, the president is Julia Goodfellow.\n\nStructure\nAs of December 2023, the society had over 4,500 members, mainly in the UK. It is affiliated with the European body, Federation of European Biochemical Societies (FEBS). The president has been Julia Goodfellow since 2022. \nThe Society's headquarters are in London.\n\nHistory\nThe society was founded in 1911, under the name of the Biochemical Club. An informal preliminary meeting on 21 January 1911 at University College, London was organised by John Addyman Gardner and R. H. A. Plimmer and attended by 32 people. The first meeting was on 4 March 1911, with 38 members present; an initial decision to exclude women was rescinded the following year. The first committee consisted of Plimmer (honorary treasurer and secretary), Gardner, H. E. Armstrong, W. M. Bayliss, A. J. Brown, H. H. Dale, A. E. Garrod, W. D. Halliburton, Arthur Harden, F. G. Hopkins, F. Keeble, Benjamin Moore, Walter Ramsden and E. J. Russell. By the end of 1911, there were 132 members.\nIn 1912, it purchased the existing Biochemical Journal from Moore and Edward Whitley for £150, with the new editors being Bayliss and Harden. The name formally changed to the Biochemical Society in 1913, with Hopkins being appointed the first chair. Gardner took over as treasurer, remaining in the post until 1944, and was responsible for steering the society's finances through the First World War. The three earliest women members, elected in 1913, were Ida Smedley, who became the first female chair of the society, Harriette Chick and Muriel Wheldale. In the early years eight annual meetings were generally held, predominantly in London, but also in Oxford, Cambridge, Rothamsted, Glasgow, Edinburgh and elsewhere.\nMembership had risen to over a thousand by 1944, and that year the society proposed the Biological Council, which formed an umbrella organisation for the Anatomical Society, Linnean Society, Pathological Society, Physiological Society and the Society for Experimental Biology. In 1949, the society organised the first International Congress of Biochemistry, in Cambridge, before the foundation of the International Union of Biochemistry in 1955. Plimmer was the society's first historian; his 1949 history is described by the American science historian Robert E. Kohler as an \"important primary document\" for the early history of biochemistry in the UK, and in particular for why the society's founding members chose to separate from the older Physiological Society. An updated history was published in 1969 by Richard A. Morton.\nBy the late 1960s, according to science historian Pnina Abir-Am, the society had established itself as a \"well-organized nationwide power base for biochemists\", and a \"powerful\" body whose activities went beyond the usual ones of a learned society to encompass \"guarding the professional status, even welfare, of its members\". In 1969, a subcommittee of the society chaired by Hans Krebs published a well-received report about the relationship between biochemistry and the discipline of molecular biology, stating that all biology was in part molecular, in response to a 1968 report by the Working Group on Molecular Biology, chaired by John C. Kendrew. The report proposes using the term \"biochemistry\" as a shorthand to include molecular biology as well as biophysics. That year the society celebrated its 500th meeting, at which Kendrew was among the speakers. According to the former CEO Chris Kirk (in 2011), membership peaked in the mid-1990s at around nine thousand, and had since fallen.\nThe society's first permanent headquarters were at 7 Warwick Court in Holborn, purchased in 1966. In 1990, the headquarters of the society moved to Portland Place, and in 2005, to modern offices in Procter Street, Holborn. In 2009, the headquarters moved again to Charles Darwin House, Roger Street, sharing premises with the Society for Experimental Biology, British Ecological Society and the Royal Society of Biology.\nThe society's past presidents are Sir Hans Kornberg (1990–95), Sir Philip Randle (1996–2000), Dame Jean O. Thomas (2001–5), Sir Philip Cohen (2006–8), Sir Tom Blundell (2009–12), Ron Laskey (2012–14), Sir David Baulcombe (2015–17) and Sir Peter Downes (2018–21).\n\nAwards\nThe Society has given awards to acknowledge excellence and achievement in biochemistry or in particular subfields since 1958. The earliest was the Hopkins Memorial Lecture, in memory of Frederick Gowland Hopkins (1958–2008). Later awards include the Colworth Medal (1963), the CIBA Medal/Novartis Medal (1965–2023) and the Morton Lecture, in honour of Richard Alan Morton (1978).\n\nPublishing\nThe society's wholly owned publishing subsidiary, Portland Press (established in 1989), publishes a magazine, The Biochemist, and several academic journals:\n\nBiochemical Journal\nBiochemical Society Transactions\nClinical Science\nEssays in Biochemistry\nBioscience Reports\n\nOther activities\nThe society holds archives of material from some prominent biochemists, and had recorded oral history interviews on video with around twenty scientists in 1988. The society published several editions of a \"renowned\" booklet by V. Booth with advice on how to write a scientific paper.\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nGoodwin, T. W. (1987).

    "text": "Homeobox protein notochord (NOTO) is a transcription factor encoded by the gene notochord homeobox (NOTO) located on the short arm of chromosome 2 (2p13.2) in humans (Homo sapiens). An ortholog of NOTO is found in the house mouse (Mus musculus), among other species, as the gene notochord homeobox (Noto) located on chromosome 6, which encodes the homologous transcription factor homeobox protein notochord (Noto).\nIn the house mouse, Noto is expressed in cells comprising the primitive node (node) of the developing embryo and functions to define the shape of the primitive node, help develop the lateral (left-right) asymmetry of the embryo, and form cilia primarily on posterior nodal cells. Noto is also essential for the proper development of the caudal notochord. Noto acts downstream of the genes Foxa2 and T, and its expression is absent in embryos with mutant forms of Foxa2 and T. However, a direct relationship for the regulation of Noto expression by Foxa2 and T has not yet been confirmed. In contrast, Noto acts upstream of Foxj1 and Rfx3, which both function in the ciliogenesis of certain other mouse tissues.\nMouse embryos with mutant forms of Noto have been characterized by shortened nodal cilia, basal bodies deeply embedded in the cell cytoplasm, and/or an abnormally-developed caudal notochord (complete absence in some cases). In one experiment, replacing Noto with Foxj1 resulted in functional nodal cilia, but only with Noto expression were cilia localized on posterior nodal cells and the normal shape of the node established. Additionally, Noto mutant embryos are subject to randomization of lateral asymmetry and are therefore often characterized by isomerization of the lungs, malformation of the cardiac outflow tract, heterotaxia, and/or situs inversus.\n\n\n== References ==",

He was born in San Miguel de Tucumán in 1851 and died in 1909.\n\nCareer\nSantiago Gallo and his brother Delfin Gallo grew up in San Miguel de Tucumán and belonged to the Tucumán oligarchy. Unlike his brother, his activities were concentrated in the sugar industry. He was in charge of two mills in Tucumán, Lujan and El Colmenar, and one in Santiago del Estero, the Contreras mill.\n\nPolitical controversy\nSantiago Gallo became Governor of Tucumán on October 12, 1884, as a successor of Benjamin Paz. As he was an opponent of Miguel Juárez Celman he was prevented from taking office. His enemies turned to the recent Tucumán Constitution, whose Article 13 said that the current governor would fulfill his term to the end, but the successor should conform to the new Constitution. As it concerned Benjamin Paz, who was a few days from demitting office when the constitution was passed, he was entitled to three years in office. As it related to Galló he would only serve two years. The question was settled by the Permanent Electoral College and ruled that the governor should remain for three years.\nHowever, the opposition asked for the Federal Congress’ intervention. President Julio Argentino Roca complied with the Tucumán opponents, but warned Delfín Galló that he could not guarantee that the same thing would happen after his presidency ended. In June 1886, Juárez Celman was sworn in as president.\n\nResignation\nIn accordance with the agreement with Roca, on September 3 Galló resigned the governorship, and was replaced by someone else close to \"Juarism\", such as the industrialist Juan Posse.",

    "text": "Eriogonum nudum is a perennial shrub of the wild buckwheat genus which is known by the common name naked buckwheat or nude buckwheat.\n\nDescription\nThe Eriogonum nudum plant is a tall, bare, leafless stem, bifurcating into more stems, each topped with rounded clusters of white or pale pink or yellow flowers growing up to six feet from a basal rosette at the ground, where the flat green leaves are located. An striking characteristic is that flower clusters typically occur at the branch as well as the branch tips.  The naked stem gives the plant its common name.\n\nDistribution\nNaked buckwheat can be found scattered around the west coast of the United States. This species has one of the widest ecological distributions of all of the buckwheats. It can be found at wet coastal sea level locales and the coldest, driest elevations of the Sierra Nevada, as well as many areas in between.\nThe species is not uncommon, but some specific varieties are quite rare.\n\nButterflies\nNectar-feeding insects such as butterflies are attracted to buckwheat flowers. At least one butterfly subspecies (Apodemia mormo langei) uses naked buckwheat as its primary food source.\nThe complex of varieties and subspecies of naked buckwheat includes:\n\nEriogonum nudum var. auriculatum - eared naked buckwheat\nEriogonum nudum var. decurrens - Ben Lomond buckwheat\nEriogonum nudum var. deductum\nEriogonum nudum var. indictum - protruding buckwheat\nEriogonum nudum var. murinum - mouse buckwheat\nEriogonum nudum var. nudum\nEriogonum nudum var. oblongifolium - oblong-leaved buckwheat\nEriogonum nudum var. paralinum - Del Norte buckwheat\nEriogonum nudum ssp. pauciflorum - few-flowered naked buckwheat\nEriogonum nudum var. psychicola - Antioch Dunes buckwheat\nEriogonum nudum var. pubiflorum - hairy-flowered buckwheat\nEriogonum nudum var. regirivum - Kings River buckwheat\nEriogonum nudum var. scapigerum\nEriogonum nudum var. westonii - Weston's buckwheat\nEriogonum nudum var. gramineu\nEriogonum nudum ssp. saxicola\n\nExternal links\n\nEriogonum nudum USDA info page\nJepson Flora Project entry\nPhytologia v.89 no.3 (2007) pp 287",

On 25 August, together with units of voivode Đekić and Vlajko Ćurčić (voivode of Zlatar) he participated in capture of Axis controlled Kokin Brod when all members of its garrison were killed. His deputy was Borislav Mirković.\nKalaitović almost certainly participated in the Battle of Nova Varoš on 5 September 1941.\n\nEstablishment of the Mileševa Corps\nOn 29 October 1941 Kalaitović attended the gathering of people from villages Štitkovo, Božetić and Bukovik, organized by Chetnik officer Boža Javorski. In February 1942 joint forces of Chetniks under command of Kalaitović and Muslim militia commanded by Hasan Zvizdić attacked the Communist forces. Originally Kalaitović was under command of Chetnik commander Miloš Glišić, who worked both for the German-appointed puppet Government of National Salvation and for the Chetniks of Draža Mihailović. During anti-Partisan operation in April–May 1942, Kalaitović's detachment was known for lack of discipline, as well as from robbery from local population. Village of Ujniče near Nova Varoš, was completely robbed and razed and few citizens were killed by Kalaitović's men. Glišić thought this behaviour was 'ruining image of Chetnik movement'. After Glišić was arrested by Gestapo in Autumn of 1942 the organization of the Chetnik units in valley of the river Lim was changed, based on the initiative of Pavle Đurišić, and Mileševa Corp was established.\n\nParticipation in Đurišić's raids of revenge\nOn January 5, 1943, Montenegrin Chetniks, commanded by Pavle Đurišić, attacked 33 villages predominantly populated with Muslims in the region of Lower Bihor. They pursued raids of revenge against Sandžak Muslims, many being innocent villagers, with the goal of settling accounts with Muslim militias.\nIn February 1943, Chetnik units commanded by Kalaitović, together with those commanded by Ostojić, Baćović, Đurišić and Lukačević killed about 1,200 Muslim Militiamen and about 8,000 women, children and old people. In just one village, Kasidoli near Priboj, Kalaitović's troops killed 227 Muslims, most of whom were killed either by cold weapons or by being burnt alive in their homes.\n\nAnti-partisan terror\nIn June 1943. Kalaitović ordered killing of 12 prominent pro-partisan villagers in Bistrica near Nova Varoš. Another crime in Bistrica by Kalaitović's Chetniks happened in October of same year, when they killed 5 members of same family and burnt down 45 houses of partisan supporters. In June 1944. 17 citizens of Nova Varoš and near by villages were executed by Mileševa Corps.\n\nRetreating with Đurišić toward Slovenia through Bosnia\nMileševa Corp with 200 men at that time commanded by Kalaitović joined retreating units of Pavle Đurišić at the end of 1944. On 16 December 1944 his units were ambushed near Miljevina and suffered substantial casualties that left him unable for further actions.\nThe Chetnik units were restructured against the order published on 5 January 1945, but Mileševa Corps remained non-restructured and under command of Kalaitović and among other Chetnik units of Chetnik HQ for Montenegro, Boka and Old Ras. Kalaitović and his units participated in the Battle of Lijevče Field.\n\nLeaving Đurišić and return to Štitkovo\nAfter the battle, Kalaitović and group of his Chetniks retreated from the region of Banja Luka with intention to return to Sanjak region. They left Đurišić on 9 April 1945. In area between Kalinovik and Foča, 37th Sandžak division inflicted significant losses to Kalaitović's Chetniks. According to report dated 1 May 1945 they captured around 80 Chetniks, and Kalaitović escaped towards Romanija with around hundred men.\nKalaitović was one of Chetnik commanders who survived defeat of Chetnik forces on Zelengora on 13 May 1945.\nAfter the war Kalaitović lead a unit of outlaws, who were responsible for killing 31 people, mostly civilians. Kalaitović died in January 1948, in a fight with Yugoslav police.\n\nLegacy\nIn 2010 a monument dedicated to Kalaitović was placed in the village of Štitkovo on the Kalaitović family estate. Serbian historian Salih Selimović states that Kalaitović protected the Muslim population and never attacked any of Muslim localities within the zone of his responsibility. When, during 1945, Communist authorities discovered that Kalaitović was hiding in the village of Kladnica, they blocked the area, but Muslim villagers helped Kalaitović to hide and escape. Serbian historian Dubravka Stojanović objected to the monument in Štitkovo  because Kalaitović's units did commit war crimes.\nIn 2013 a memorial plaque to 108 Chetniks who died in the World War II was placed in Štitkovo.\n\nReferences\n\n\n== Sources ==",

    "text": "Francisco José Rodrigues da Costa  (born 1 December 1974), known as Costinha (Portuguese pronunciation: [kɔʃˈtiɲɐ]), is a Portuguese former professional footballer who played as a defensive midfielder. He was also a manager.\nBest known for his tackling and positioning, as well as his athleticism, stamina and workrate, he played for clubs in Portugal, France, Russia, Spain and Italy. He won eight trophies with Porto, including the 2004 Champions League.\nCostinha played more than 50 times with Portugal, appearing with the national team in one World Cup and two European Championships and being part of the squad that reached the final in Euro 2004. After retiring, he worked as a manager for Beira-Mar, Paços Ferreira, Académica and Nacional.\n\nClub career\nEarly career\nCostinha was born in Lisbon to an Angolan father, who had immigrated to the Portuguese capital in the 1960s. A childhood Sporting CP fan, he began his career in the third division with Clube Oriental de Lisboa, A.D. Machico and C.D. Nacional.\n\nMonaco\nIn the summer of 1997, Costinha signed a five-year contract with La Liga's Valencia CF, but backed out when manager Jorge Valdano wanted to loan him to Villarreal CF; he then caught the interest of French club AS Monaco FC who acquired him through the influence of agent Jorge Mendes. After a tentative first season he became an important first-team member, helping with 28 matches and one goal to the 1999–2000 conquest of the Ligue 1 championship; he was part of a talented side which ousted Manchester United from the UEFA Champions League in 1998, on the away goals rule.\n\nPorto\nCostinha joined FC Porto on a five-year deal in May 2001, and made his Primeira Liga debut on 12 August aged nearly 27; he was sent off in a 1–0 loss away to Sporting. He went on to be an instrumental midfield element in the northerners' two consecutive national championships. On 9 March 2004, he scored against and effectively knocked out Manchester United in the Champions League round of 16; Porto went on to win the title, beating his former side Monaco 3–0 in the final.\n\nLater career\nAgain a starter throughout most of the 2004–05 campaign, Costinha was sold to FC Dynamo Moscow in May 2005 for €4 million alongside teammates Maniche and Giourkas Seitaridis, following Derlei who left in January. The following month, he was suspended after an incident in a training camp in Israel. Unsettled, he moved to Atlético Madrid on a two-year contract ahead of 2006–07.\nCostinha was released by the Spaniards in August 2007, joining Atalanta BC of Serie A, where he appeared very rarely throughout his spell – only one match, in his first season – due to serious injuries and later because he was not considered fit to play competitively, despite him having the highest salary in the first team (€700,000 per year, in a contract due to expire in June 2010). The club tried to agree a mutual termination of the contract with him, and also attempted unsuccessfully to rescind it through the Italian Football League.\n\nInternational career\nCostinha made his debut for Portugal on 14 October 1998, in a 3–0 home win over Slovakia for the UEFA Euro 2000 qualifiers; he entered as a 67th-minute substitute in place of Rui Costa. He was selected for the final stages, where he scored an injury time header against Romania (same score).\nHe also played at Euro 2004 and the 2006 FIFA World Cup tournaments. During the latter, on 25 June, he took part in the Battle of Nuremberg, being one of four players sent off in the 1–0 round-of-16 victory over the Netherlands after two bookable offences, the second being a handball.\nCostinha finished his international career with 53 caps and two goals, having been rarely called during the Euro 2008 qualifying stage.\n\nCoaching career\nDirector\nOn 23 February 2010, the 35-year-old Costinha left Atalanta by mutual consent. He immediately retired, being named shortly afterwards as Sporting's director of football, succeeding the sacked Ricardo Sá Pinto, his former international teammate. On 9 February 2011, the day after an interview to Sport TV in which he criticised the club's board of directors, he was dismissed.\nIn June 2011, in the same capacity, Costinha joined Servette FC, with the Swiss team being managed by countryman João Alves. It was reported that the pair did not see eye to eye on certain issues, and in November 2011, Alves was relieved of his duties and replaced by João Carlos Pereira. The team's results worsened under Pereira and in April 2012, both Pereira and Costinha were fired, with Alves being reinstated as manager; Costinha reportedly contested the terms of his removal, claiming that his contract extended until June 2013.\n\nBeira-Mar, Paços Ferreira and Académica\nCostinha was hired as manager of S.C. Beira-Mar on 18 February 2013, replacing Ulisses Morais. His debut five days later was a 1–0 defeat at Vitória de Setúbal. He left the club on 22 May, after its top-flight relegation.\nOn 12 June 2013, Costinha was appointed at fellow top-tier F.C. Paços de Ferreira, who had made the qualifying rounds of the Champions League for the first time in their history; his midfield partner for Portugal and three teams, Maniche, was hired as assistant. Costinha was sacked after only four months, however, due to poor results.\nCostinha took over at Académica de Coimbra, recently relegated from the top division, on 20 June 2016. Maniche again assisted him, until leaving for personal reasons in October.\n\nNacional\nOn 30 May 2017, Costinha was appointed as manager of Nacional. In his first year, they were promoted back to the top tier as champions.\nCostinha left a year later by mutual consent, due to the Madeira team's relegation as second-bottom. Negative highlights included a 10–0 loss against eventual champions S.L. Benfica, on 10 February 2019.\nCostinha returned to Nacional – again relegated from the main division – on 28 June 2021, on a one-year deal. He left on 20 September, having achieved a win and a draw in five games.\n\nCareer statistics\nClub\nInternational\nScores and results list Portugal's goal tally first, score column indicates score after each Costinha goal.\n\nManagerial statistics\nAs of 16 May 2019\n\nHonours\nPlayer\nMonaco\n\nLigue 1: 1999–2000\nTrophée des Champions: 1997, 2000\nPorto\n\nPrimeira Liga: 2002–03, 2003–04\nTaça de Portugal: 2002–03\nSupertaça Cândido de Oliveira: 2003, 2004\nUEFA Champions League: 2003–04\nUEFA Cup: 2002–03\nIntercontinental Cup: 2004\nPortugal\n\nUEFA European Championship runner-up: 2004\n\nManager\nNacional\n\nLigaPro: 2017–18\n\nOrders\nMedal of Merit, Order of the Immaculate Conception of Vila Viçosa (House of Braganza)\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nCostinha at ForaDeJogo (archived) \nCostinha manager stats at ForaDeJogo (archived)\nCostinha at L'Équipe Football (in French)\nCostinha at BDFutbol\nCostinha national team profile at the Portuguese Football Federation (in Portuguese)\nCostinha at National-Football-Teams.com\nCostinha – FIFA competition record (archived)",

    "text": "Maryland Route 104 (MD 104) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland.  Known as Waterloo Road, the state highway runs 1.14 miles (1.83 km) from MD 108 in Columbia north to MD 103 in Ellicott City.  MD 104 connects MD 108, MD 103, and MD 100 in northeastern Howard County.  The state highway was originally constructed as MD 531 in the early 1930s and became part of MD 175 in the mid-1940s.  After MD 175 was rerouted through Columbia in the late 1970s, MD 104 was assigned to its present course.\n\nRoute description\nMD 104 begins at a three-way intersection with MD 108 in the hamlet of Jonestown on the northern edge of the Columbia village of Long Reach.  MD 108 heads southeast as a continuation of Waterloo Road toward Jessup and west as Old Annapolis Road, which provides access to Howard High School and ramps to and from eastbound MD 100.  MD 104 heads north as a four-lane undivided highway across MD 100 to a roundabout where the state highway intersects ramps to and from westbound MD 100.  MD 104 reduces to two lanes and passes through a suburban area on the southern edge of Ellicott City, where the highway reaches its northern terminus at MD 103 (Montgomery Road), which heads southeast toward Elkridge and northwest toward downtown Ellicott City.\n\nHistory\nWaterloo Road was built as a macadam road in 1932 from U.S. Route 1 (US 1) in Jessup north to MD 103 in Ellicott City; the highway was designated MD 531.  MD 531 was replaced with a northern extension of MD 175 from Jessup to Ellicott City by 1946.  Old Annapolis Road was designated MD 539 in 1956; that highway became part of an extended MD 108 in 1960 when US 29 was moved to Columbia Pike from Silver Spring to Ellicott City.\nAfter MD 175 was rerouted along Little Patuxent Parkway (now named Rouse Parkway) from west of Interstate 95 (I-95) to Columbia Town Center around 1977, MD 108 was extended east to its present terminus near I-95.  The portion of Waterloo Road between MD 108 and MD 103 was designated MD 104 by 1979.  When MD 100 was under construction between MD 104 and I-95 in the late 1990s, a standard intersection with MD 104 served as the eastern terminus of the two-lane, disjoint section of MD 100 between US 29 and MD 104.  MD 104's interchange with MD 100 was completed in 1998 concurrent with the portion of the freeway from MD 104 to I-95.\n\nJunction list\nThe entire route is in Howard County.\n\nAuxiliary route\nMD 104A is the designation for the 0.16-mile (0.26 km) section of Oak Run Way between MD 104 and the residential subdivision the street serves immediately north of MD 104's interchange with MD 100.\n\nSee also\nMaryland Roads portal\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nMDRoads: MD 104",

    "text": "Elizabeth Lutton or Elizabeth Sutton or \"Mrs Thomas Scaseby\" (1498–before 1553) was an English Benedictine nun (and potential heiress) who became pregnant. She was abducted and married. The marriage was \"contrary to the laws of God\", and she was returned to Yedingham Priory.\n\nLife\nLutton was born about 1498. Her father was Stephen Lutton, and her grandfather, William Lutton, owned land in Knapton. About 1512, when she was fourteen years old, she became a Benedictine nun at Yedingham Priory in North Yorkshire. She later complained that she had become a nun contrary to her wishes.\nIn 1526 Agnes Brayerdricke succeeded Dame Elizabeth White as head of Yedingham Priory and Brayerdricke soon discovered that Elizabeth Lutton was pregnant. Brayerdricke had her separated from the other nuns until the child was born. Lutton was then allowed to resume her place.\nLocal landowner Robert Constable of Flamborough visited Yedingham Priory where he learned about Elizabeth Lutton. Constable encouraged Thomas Scaseby to elope with Elizabeth Lutton in 1531. Scaseby may have been the father of the child, and he married Lutton. This was a serious crime, as Lutton was still under vows as a nun. Constable's motive for getting involved was that Elizabeth was a potential heiress, and the marriage was to Constable's advantage in his own territorial disputes. Lutton argued that she had become a nun under duress, and she was therefore free to marry and to inherit her grandfather's lands. She was supported by the Abbess but not by any of the other nuns.\n\nResult\nLutton's uncle took the resulting dispute to the Star Chamber. He had inherited Lutton's grandfather's lands, and Constable had seized them, citing Lutton's marriage. In 1532, an ecclesiastical judge from York arrived to interview all who were involved.  The judges decided that Lutton's marriage was \"contrary to the laws of God and Holly Church, and to the detestable and pernicious example of all other lyke offendors, and to the ruin and decay of holly religion\". Lutton returned to being a nun, and her uncle recovered his lands.\nRobert Constable was executed at Hull for (other) sundry crimes on 6 July 1537. The priory was suppressed in August 1539, and the eight or nine nuns were pensioned off. One of these was Elizabeth Sutton, and this is presumed to be Lutton who received 26 shillings and eight pence. A later record in February 1553 listed the nuns who were still receiving a pension, but she was not included in that list.\n\n\n== References ==",

It ran from 13 April to 1 July 1922.\nIt starred Eddie Cantor, who introduced the hit songs \"Yes! We Have No Bananas\" and \"The Sheik of Araby\".\n\nProduction\nHarold R. Atteridge and Eddie Cantor wrote the book. Harold Atteridge wrote the lyrics to music by Jean Schwartz.\nAlfred Bryan and William B. Friedlander wrote additional lyrics, and Friedlander wrote additional music.\nThe show was produced by The Winter Garden Company, with production supervised by Jacob J. Shubert and staged by Jesse C. Huffman.\nLouis Gress was musical director. Dell Lampe orchestrated the music and Allan K. Foster staged the musical numbers.\nThe show ran at the Winter Garden from 13 April 1922 to 1 July 1922. \nEddie Cantor headlined with Nan Halperin, J. Harold Murray and Lew Hearn.\nShubert sent the show on tour after it had closed on Broadway. In Philadelphia, in the last week of the tour, Cantor introduced the song Yes!

    "text": "Curse of the Swamp Creature is a 1968 American-made for television horror science fiction film directed by Larry Buchanan. Although Buchanan was producing low-budget 16mm color remakes of American International Pictures sci-fi movies for television distribution around this time, he claimed this was an original even though it bears more than a few striking similarities to the 1957 AIP film Voodoo Woman.\nBuchanan later said, \"Never make a swamp picture. Your film comes back, and it's all... strange.\"\n\nPlot\nDeep in the rural swamps of Texas, the reclusive and ruthless wife-abusing mad scientist Dr. Simond Trent is conducting experiments in his laboratory on the local impoverished voodoo-worshiping black \"natives\" in an attempt to discover the secret to reversing evolution, feeding the failures to the alligators he keeps in his covered outdoor swimming pool. When a party of oil surveyors comes upon his isolated yet strangely suburban-style home, he decides to take the final step and turn the duplicitous female leader of the expedition into a grotesque and virtually indestructible amphibious \"Fish Man\" so that he can take his revenge upon the world.\n\nCast\nProduction\nDespite showing the monster very prominently on the posters of the film, which bill it as an \"underwater terror from another age,\" other than brief, partial glimpses down into the mist-filled glass tank where its body is being modified from its original human form, the titular creature (with its burly physique, bald head, Spock-like ears and protruding slit-pupiled, ping pong ball-shaped eyes) only appears at the climax of the film for less than five minutes before meeting its demise, and no scenes take place underwater.\nThe hospital gown-clad creature was created using primitive prosthetic make-up and grayish-green body paint rather than the infamously cheap and phony-looking scalloped-scaled rubber wetsuit (with webbed fingers) and fiercely-fanged fish head mask (with painted ping-pong-ball eyes) Buchanan later used in Creature of Destruction and 'It's Alive!'.\nThe movie was filmed in Uncertain, Texas, where the Fly-N-Fish Lodge and Airport seen in early scenes still exists.\nThe film re-uses Ronald Stein's previous music from both It Conquered the World and Invasion of the Saucer Men.\n\nReception\nCurse of the Swamp Creature has received predominantly negative reviews.\nTV Guide gave the film 1/5 stars, calling it \"[a] typically silly effort\". Jon Condit from Dread Central awarded the film 1.5 out of 5, writing, \"Curse of the Swamp Creature is actually one of Z-grade schlockmeister Larry Buchanan’s better movies. That’s not to say that it’s any good, just a comment that you can probably sit all the way through it from beginning to end without falling asleep or wanting to gouge your eyes out with your own fingers.\" Writing for AllMovie, critic Robert Firsching described the film as a \"low-budget horror oddity\" and a \"forgettable trifle [that] will be of interest to genre completists only.\" Describing Jeff Alexander's performance as \"so maniacally over the top that he’s almost fascinating to watch,\" critic George Reis wrote that the film \"defines schlocky cinema as an art form in every way possible - from lousy acting, to shoddy camera set-ups, to an array of unintended laughs and a disappointing monster.\"\n\nLegacy\nA Curse of the Swamp Creature mask was one of the last items produced by the famed Don Post Studios before it went out of business in 2012.\n\nSee also\nList of American films of 1966\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nCurse of the Swamp Creature at IMDb\nCurse of the Swamp Creature at Rotten Tomatoes",

    "title": "Skidel revolt",
    "text": "The Skidel Revolt (Polish: Powstanie Skidelskie, Belarusian: Скідзельскае паўстанне) or Skidal Uprising (term used in Soviet historiography) was an anti-state and anti-Polish sabotage action done by Jewish and Belarusian inhabitants of the Polish town of Skidel near Grodno (now Skidzieĺ, Belarus) at the onset of World War II. It started on the second day of the Soviet invasion of Poland in an attempt to assist the external attack.\n\nBackground\nThe events\nThe revolt of 18 September 1939 was organized by the Communist Party of West Belarus which was outlawed by Poland in 1938. According to Russian documents, it consisted of around 200 men, although their number has been contested by Polish historian Marek Wierzbicki as exaggerated.  A group of Jews and Belarusians, members and sympathizers of the delegalized Communist Party, all citizens of Poland, took control of the town of Skidel and some nearby locations, acquired firearms, often from skirmishes with Polish Army units and police. Similar incidents of various severity, with pro-communist activists attacking and taking over local government offices, arresting or fighting with Polish police and army personnel, took place in numerous nearby settlements including Jeziory, Wiercieliszki, Wielka Brzostowica, Dubno, Wołpa, Indura (near Grodno), Sopoćkinie, Zelwa, Wołkowysk, Ostryna, Zdzięcioł (near Nowogródek), Janów Poleski, Horodec, Antopol, Drohiczyn Poleski and Motol nearby among other locations. In a number of instances, individual or groups of former authority figures, such as civil servants, landowners, priests, rural settlers, policemen and reserve officers, usually of Polish ethnicity, were murdered, including in Skidel, Brzostowica Mała, Lerypol, Budowla, and other locations. Wierzbicki estimates that there were dozens if not hundreds of such incidents.\nSeveral Polish families were rescued by their Belarusian neighbors in the village of Sawalówka.\nIn some settlements, the withdrawal of Polish administration ahead of the Soviet advance prompted Jewish councils to form self-defense groups against the Belarusian raids which further complicated the issue of allegiance.  Some of the self-defending Jews were driven by deep-seated Polish patriotism.\nPolish Army units quickly engaged the insurgents. On 19 September 1939 the 102nd Uhlan Regiment of the Polish Army engaged some insurgents around Ostryna, Dubno and Jeziory. After some skirmishes, Polish units put down the revolt and took control of Skidel and neighboring settlements. The insurgents captured with weapons were summarily executed. Shortly afterward, on 20 September, advancing Red Army units, supported by armor, took over Skidel, pushing the Polish forces back.\n\nAftermath\nWhen Soviet forces took over Skidel, many Poles were immediately arrested. Some time later in 1940 there was a show trial in Skidel of 15 individuals including three women, two Tartars and two Polish Russians, who aided the Polish Army which briefly retook Skidel on 19 September. They were accused of crimes against the Soviet Union. There is no historical record of what happened to them, although Wierzbicki states that fragmentary information and \"common practice\" suggests that at least some of them were executed. After the end of World War II, and the annexation of eastern Poland, the mass murders and robberies were hushed up and the sabotage action in Skidzieĺ turned by the Soviet Union into a province-wide liberation movement.\nIn 1940 the Soviet authorities found clear evidence of the widespread robberies and mass murders committed on the side by scores of intoxicated peasants and criminal opportunists, but after the intervention of the communist party representative, the Soviet court threw out the case citing political rationale (justified class struggle), as well as procedural reasons (that it has no jurisdiction to persecute crimes that happened on those territories before the Soviet annexation of them on, that legal documents dated to 2 November 1939). After the annexation of eastern Poland, the Soviet propaganda turned the Skidzieĺ events into a liberation movement, and mythologized them.\n\nSee also\nWar crimes in occupied Poland during World War II\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nWojciech Wybranowski (2 October 2002). \"Kłopotliwe śledztwo.

Her parents were Frances Ann (née Hodgson) and William Delafield Arnold. Her grandfather was the Rugby headmaster Thomas Arnold. Her father worked as director of education in the Punjab. Her mother died in the year after she was born and she and her three siblings were sent to England. Their father died in 1859 en route in Gibraltar so they arrived in England as orphans, but they were adopted by her mother's sister Jane Martha (née Arnold) and her husband William Edward Forster.\nHer adoptive parents initially saw to her education before she attended a private girls' school. When she was an adult she and her sister and two brothers all legally changed their last name to Arnold-Forster. Her brothers were Edward Penrose Arnold-Forster and Hugh Oakeley Arnold-Forster. Hugh became a politician and writer and her sister Florence Mary Arnold-Forster set up the Limerick Lace School.\nForster took an interest in the work of missionaries. She was a member and supporter of the Church Missionary Society and the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. She took a particular interest in St James the Less Church in Pimlico and its mission; the church was built in 1850 in a poor part of London by three sisters.\nShe wrote particularly about missionary work overseas. In 1885 she wrote Heralds of the Cross which was about missionary work.\nPossibly her most important work is Studies in Church Dedications: or, England's Patron Saints (1899) which was issued in three volumes.

    "title": "Vasopressin receptor 2",
    "text": "Vasopressin receptor 2 (V2R), or arginine vasopressin receptor 2 (officially called AVPR2), is a protein that acts as receptor for vasopressin.  AVPR2 belongs to the subfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors. Its activity is mediated by the Gs type of G proteins, which stimulate adenylate cyclase.\nAVPR2 is expressed in the kidney tubule, predominantly in the membrane of cells of the distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts, in fetal lung tissue and lung cancer, the last two being associated with alternative splicing. AVPR2 is also expressed outside the kidney in vascular endothelium. Stimulation causes the release of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII from the endothelial cells. Because von Willebrand factor helps stabilize circulating levels of factor VIII, the vasopressin analog desmopressin can be used to stimulate the AVPR2 receptor and increase levels of circulating factor VIII. This is useful in the treatment of hemophilia A as well as Von Willebrand disease.\nIn the kidney, AVPR2's primary property is to respond to arginine vasopressin by stimulating mechanisms that concentrate the urine and maintain water homeostasis in the organism. When the function of AVPR2 is lost, the disease nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) results.\n\nAntagonists\nVasopressin receptor antagonists that are selective for the V2 receptor include:\n\nTolvaptan (FDA-approved)\nLixivaptan\nMozavaptan\nSatavaptan\nTheir main uses are in hyponatremia, such as that caused by syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) and heart failure, however these agents should be avoided in patients with cirrhosis.\nDemeclocycline and lithium carbonate act as indirect antagonists of renal vasopressin V2 receptors by inhibiting activation of the second messenger cascade of the receptors.\n\nPharmacoperones\nVasopressin receptor 2 function has been shown to be deleteriously effected by point mutations in its gene. Some of these mutations, when expressed, cause the receptor to remain in the cytosol. An approach to rescue receptor function utilizes pharmacoperones or molecular chaperones, which are typically small molecules that rescue misfolded proteins to the cell surface. These interact with the receptor to restore cognate receptor function devoid of antagonist or agonist activity. This approach, when effective, should increase therapeutic reach. Pharmacoperones have been identified that restore function of V2R.\n\nInteractions\nArginine vasopressin receptor 2 has been shown to interact with C1QTNF1.\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links\nGeneReviews/NCBI/NIH/UW entry on Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus\n\"Symbol Report: AVPR2\".

    "title": "Charlie Parker",
    "text": "Charles Parker Jr. (August 29, 1920 – March 12, 1955), nicknamed \"Bird\" or \"Yardbird\", was an American jazz saxophonist, bandleader, and composer. Parker was a highly influential soloist and leading figure in the development of bebop, a form of jazz characterized by fast tempos, virtuosic technique, and advanced harmonies. He was a virtuoso and introduced revolutionary rhythmic and harmonic ideas into jazz, including rapid passing chords, new variants of altered chords, and chord substitutions. Parker primarily played the alto saxophone.\nParker was an icon for the hipster subculture and later the Beat Generation, personifying the jazz musician as an uncompromising artist and intellectual rather than just an entertainer.\n\nEarly life\nCharles Parker Jr. was born in Kansas City, Kansas, to Charles Parker Sr. and Adelaide \"Addie\" Bailey, who was of mixed Choctaw and African-American background. He was raised in Kansas City, Missouri, near Westport Road. His father, a Pullman waiter and chef on the railways, was often required to travel for work, but provided some musical influence because he was a pianist, dancer, and singer on the Theatre Owners Booking Association circuit. Parker's mother worked nights at the local Western Union office during the 1920s.\nParker first went to a Catholic school and sang in its choir, but his parents separated in 1930 due to his father's alcoholism and the effects of the Great Depression. By the time he was in high school, Parker, his older half-brother John, and his mother Addie were living near 15th Street and Olive Street and she was working as a cleaner in order to afford housing.\nParker began playing the saxophone at age 11, and at age 14 he joined the Lincoln High School band, where he studied under bandmaster Alonzo Lewis. His mother purchased a new alto saxophone around the same time. Parker's biggest influence in his early teens was a young trombone player named Robert Simpson, who taught him the basics of improvisation.\nParker withdrew from high school in December 1935, joined the local musicians' union, and decided to pursue his musical career full-time.\n\nCareer\n1936–1938: Jam sessions and woodshedding\nUpon leaving high school, Parker began to play with local bands in jazz clubs around Kansas City and often ambitiously took part in jam sessions with more experienced musicians. In early 1936, at one such jam session with the Count Basie Orchestra, he lost track of the chord changes while improvising. This prompted Jo Jones to contemptuously remove a cymbal from his drum kit and throw it at his feet as a signal to leave the stage.\n\nRather than becoming discouraged, Parker vowed to practice harder. He mastered improvisation and, according to his comments in an interview with Paul Desmond, spent the next three to four years practicing up to 15 hours a day. Parker proposed to Rebecca Ruffin, his girlfriend four years his senior, and the two married on July 25, 1936. They had two children before divorcing in 1939, in large part due to his growing drug addiction.\nIn late 1936, Parker and a Kansas City band traveled to the Ozarks for the opening of Musser's Resort south of Eldon, Missouri. Along the way, the caravan of musicians had a car accident and Parker broke three ribs and fractured his spine. Despite this near-death experience, in 1937 Parker returned to the area, where he spent a great deal of time woodshedding and developing his sound. Working with a pianist and guitarist, he practiced improvising over chord changes and began to develop the ability to solo fluently across chords and scales.\nIn 1938, Parker joined pianist Jay McShann's territory band. His first gig with the band was during the summer or early fall at the Continental Club in Kansas City, where Parker worked as a substitute alto saxophonist for Edward \"Popeye\" Hale. In December, he joined Harlan Leonard's Rockets; the band played at dances including a Christmas dance for which Parker was listed in a local newspaper as one of the Rockets' personnel.\n\n1939–1944: Development of bebop\nIn 1939, Parker moved to New York City to pursue his musical career but worked part-time jobs to make a living. Among the more musically significant of these was as a dishwasher for nine dollars a week at Jimmie's Chicken Shack, where pianist Art Tatum performed. Struggling with poverty, Parker went to the home of fellow alto saxophone player Buster Smith to ask for help. Smith allowed Parker to live in his apartment for six months and gave him gigs in his band. Parker's playing at the gigs impressed several New York musicians, including pianist and bandleader Earl Hines.\nWhile living in New York, Parker achieved his musical breakthrough, developing a new improvisational vocabulary which later came to be known as \"bebop\". Playing \"Cherokee\" in a practice session with guitarist William \"Biddy\" Fleet, he realized that the 12 semitones of the chromatic scale can lead melodically to any key, breaking some of the confines of simpler jazz soloing. Parker recalled: \"I'd been getting bored with the stereotyped changes that were being used all the time at the time, and I kept thinking there's bound to be something else. I could hear it sometimes but I couldn't play it ... Well, that night I was working over 'Cherokee' and, as I did, I found that by using the higher intervals of a chord as a melody line and backing them with appropriately related changes, I could play the thing I'd been hearing. I came alive.\"\n\nIn 1940, he returned to Kansas City to perform with Jay McShann and to attend the funeral of his father, Charles Sr. The younger Parker then spent the summer in McShann's band playing at Fairyland Park for all-white audiences; trumpet player Bernard Anderson introduced him to Dizzy Gillespie. The band also toured nightclubs and other venues of the southwest, as well as Chicago and New York City, and Parker made his professional recording debut with McShann's band that year. When in New York, to experiment with his new musical ideas that went beyond the bounds of McShann's group, Parker joined a group of young musicians who played in after-hours clubs in Harlem venues including Clark Monroe's Uptown House. Fellow musicians at the venues included developing beboppers Gillespie, pianist Thelonious Monk, guitarist Charlie Christian, and drummer Kenny Clarke. A pianist and one of the pioneers of bebop, Mary Lou Williams, said the after-hours sessions were an opportunity \"to challenge the practice of downtown musicians coming uptown and 'stealing' the music.\"\nParker left McShann's band in 1942 and played for one year with Hines, whose band also included Gillespie. This band's performances and therefore Parker's role in them are virtually undocumented due to the strike of 1942–1944 by the American Federation of Musicians, during which time few professional recordings were made. In fact, much of bebop's critical early development was not captured for posterity due to the ban and the new genre gained limited radio exposure as a result. The few recordings in which Parker participated in 1943 took place in Chicago and included a jam session recording with Gillespie and bassist Oscar Pettiford, another session with Billy Eckstine playing trumpet, some informally recorded practice sessions, and a duo with pianist Hazel Scott. Parker's time with Hines's band and his travel between New York and Chicago enabled him to model his style on, according to his own words, a \"combination of the Midwestern beat and the fast New York tempos.\" Parker began writing compositions thanks to his growing friendship with Gillespie, who began notating Parker's solos as melodies. Among these early Parker compositions were \"Koko\", \"Anthropology\", and \"Confirmation\".\n\nParker left Hines's band and formed a small group with Gillespie, pianist Al Haig, bassist Curley Russell, and drummer Stan Levey. The group stood out from its contemporaries, as it was racially integrated and lacked a guitarist for rhythmic support. This new format freed soloists from harmonic and rhythmic restrictions, and in late 1944 the group secured a gig at the Three Deuces club in New York. The group's name recognition spread along 52nd Street and its style was dubbed \"bebop\" for the first time. Musicians at other clubs came to hear bebop and reacted unfavorably to it because, according to Charles Mingus, they saw it as a threat to their style of jazz.\n\n1945–1953: Solo career\nOnly in 1945, after the AFM's recording ban was lifted, did Parker's collaborations with Dizzy Gillespie, Max Roach and others have a substantial effect on the jazz world. One of their first small-group performances together, a concert in New York's Town Hall on June 22, 1945, was rediscovered in 2004 and released in 2005. Bebop soon gained wider appeal among musicians and fans.\nOn November 26, 1945, Parker led a record date for Savoy Records, marketed as the \"greatest Jazz session ever\". Recording as Charlie Parker's Reboppers, Parker enlisted sidemen Gillespie and Miles Davis on trumpet, Curley Russell on bass and Max Roach on drums. The tracks recorded during this session include \"Ko-Ko\", \"Billie's Bounce\", and \"Now's the Time\".\nIn December 1945, the Parker band traveled to an unsuccessful engagement at Billy Berg's club in Los Angeles. Most of the group returned to New York, but Parker remained in California, cashing in his return ticket to buy heroin. After he dedicated one of his compositions to local drug dealer \"Moose the Mooche\" at a studio session in the spring, the dealer was arrested, and without access to heroin, Parker turned to alcohol addiction. He suffered a physical and mental breakdown after a studio session in July 1946 for Dial Records, and was briefly jailed after setting the bedsheets of his Los Angeles hotel room on fire and then running naked through the lobby while intoxicated, after which he was committed to the Camarillo State Mental Hospital for six months.\nWhen Parker was discharged from the hospital, he was healthy and free from his drug habit. Before leaving California, he recorded \"Relaxin' at Camarillo,\" in reference to his stay in the mental hospital, at one of two successful recording sessions. The first took place with a septet while the other paired Parker with pianist Erroll Garner's trio and vocalist Earl Coleman. Upon returning to New York in 1947, Parker resumed his heroin usage. He recorded dozens of sides for the Savoy and Dial labels, which remain some of the high points of his recorded output. Many of these were with his new quintet, including Davis and Roach. Parker and Davis disagreed on who should be the quintet's pianist, with Parker originally hiring Bud Powell for a May 1947 recording session but later favoring Gillespie's arranger, John Lewis; Davis preferred Duke Jordan. Ultimately the quintet used both, as Parker wanted to balance leadership of the group with mentoring younger musicians such as Davis.\nFollowing the establishment of a regular quintet, Parker signed for Mercury Records with Jazz at the Philharmonic promoter Norman Granz as his producer. The partnership enabled Parker to work with musicians from other genres, such as Latin jazz percussionist and bandleader Machito, and to appear in concerts at Carnegie Hall as part of the Jazz at the Philharmonic series. Further, Granz was able to fulfil a longstanding desire of Parker's to perform with a string section. He was a keen student of classical music, and contemporaries reported he was most interested in the music and formal innovations of Igor Stravinsky and longed to engage in a project akin to what later became known as Third Stream, a new kind of music, incorporating both jazz and classical elements as opposed to merely incorporating a string section into performance of jazz standards. On November 30, 1949, Norman Granz arranged for Parker to record an album of ballads with a mixed group of jazz and chamber orchestra musicians. Six master takes from this session became the album Charlie Parker with Strings: \"Just Friends\", \"Everything Happens to Me\", \"April in Paris\", \"Summertime\", \"I Didn't Know What Time It Was\", and \"If I Should Lose You\".\n\nIn 1950, Parker and Gillespie recorded Bird and Diz, an album that proved to be among the few times Parker worked with bebop pianist Thelonious Monk; the music was released in 1952. Meanwhile, Parker's regular group maintained popular success with a European tour in 1950 and live gigs at New York nightclubs continued, leading to live albums One Night in Birdland (with Fats Navarro and Powell) and Summit Meeting at Birdland (with Gillespie and Powell). But Parker became frustrated and disillusioned that, due to racial discrimination, he was reaching the limits of what he could achieve in his career.\nIn 1953, Parker performed at Massey Hall in Toronto, joined by Gillespie, Mingus, Powell, and Roach. The concert happened at the same time as a televised heavyweight boxing match between Rocky Marciano and Jersey Joe Walcott, so it was poorly attended. Mingus recorded the concert, which resulted in the album Jazz at Massey Hall. At the concert, Parker played a plastic Grafton saxophone.\nOther live, and often bootleg, recordings of Parker were made in the early 1950s, frequently with groups other than his usual quintet. Among the most notable of these, particularly according to critics, are Charlie Parker in Sweden (recorded during his 1950 Sweden tour), Bird at St. Nick's (with Red Rodney), Inglewood Jam (recorded in 1952 with Chet Baker), Live at Rockland Palace (recorded live with his quintet and string accompaniment), Charlie Parker at Storyville (with Herb Pomeroy and Red Garland), and The Washington Concerts (recorded unrehearsed in 1953 with a big band).\n\n1954–1955: Illness and death\nSince 1950, Parker had been living in New York City with his common-law wife, Chan Berg, the mother of his son, Baird (1952–2014), and his daughter, Pree (who died at age 3). He considered Chan his wife, although he never married her; nor did he divorce his previous wife, Doris, whom he had married in 1948.\nThe death of Parker's daughter Pree from pneumonia in 1954 devastated him and, after being fired from Birdland in September of that year, he attempted to commit suicide. He was hospitalized and made a partial recovery by early 1955 before his health declined again in March. Parker's last gig on March 4 at Birdland ended when Powell refused to play in his group and the performance spiraled into an argument among the musicians. Parker became drunk and a few days later visited the suite of Baroness Pannonica at the Stanhope Hotel in New York City in ill health. He refused to go to the hospital and died on March 12, 1955, while watching the Dorsey Brothers' Stage Show on television. The official causes of death were lobar pneumonia and a bleeding ulcer, but Parker also had advanced cirrhosis and had suffered a heart attack and a seizure. The coroner who performed his autopsy mistakenly estimated Parker's 34-year-old body to be between 50 and 60 years of age.\nThe details surrounding Parker's death were controversial. Doris Parker claimed that she, Parker's mother, and Art Blakey were aware of Parker's death before March 14, when Pannonica claimed she first revealed the news on a phone call to Chan. Pannonica, however, visited a nightclub on March 13, the day after Parker died at her apartment but before she informed Chan of Parker's death. Further, newspapers incorrectly reported Parker's age as 53 when he died, and Parker's tombstone incorrectly claimed that he died on March 23.\nParker's marital status complicated the settling of Parker's estate and ultimately frustrated his wish to be interred in New York City. Dizzy Gillespie paid for the funeral arrangements, which included a Harlem procession officiated by Congressman and Reverend Adam Clayton Powell Jr. at the Abyssinian Baptist Church and a memorial concert. Parker's body was flown back to Missouri, in accordance with his mother's wishes. Chan criticized Doris and Parker's family for giving him a Christian funeral even though they knew he was an atheist. Parker was buried at Lincoln Cemetery in Missouri, in a hamlet known as Blue Summit, located close to I-435 and East Truman Road.\nSome amount of controversy continued after Parker's burial in the Kansas City area. His tomb was engraved with the image of a tenor saxophone, though Parker is primarily associated with the alto saxophone. Later, some people wanted to move Parker's remains to reinforce redevelopment of the historic 18th and Vine area.\n\nPersonal life\nParker acquired the nickname \"Yardbird\" early in his career while on the road with Jay McShann. This, and the shortened form \"Bird\", were used as nicknames for Parker for the rest of his life and inspired the titles of a number of Parker's compositions, such as \"Yardbird Suite\", \"Ornithology\", \"Bird Gets the Worm\", and \"Bird of Paradise\".\nParker's life was riddled with mental health problems and an addiction to heroin. Although it is unclear which came first, his addiction to opiates began at the age of 16, when he was injured in a car crash and a doctor prescribed morphine for the pain. The addiction that stemmed from this incident led him to miss performances, and he was considered to be unreliable. In the jazz scene, heroin use was prevalent and the substance could be acquired with little difficulty.\nAlthough he produced many brilliant recordings during this period, Parker's behavior became increasingly erratic. Heroin was difficult to obtain once he moved to California, where the drug was less abundant, so he used alcohol as a substitute. A recording for the Dial label from July 29, 1946, provides evidence of his condition. Before this session, Parker drank a quart of whiskey. According to the liner notes of Charlie Parker on Dial Volume 1, Parker missed most of the first two bars of his first chorus on the track \"Max Making Wax\". When he finally did come in, he swayed wildly and once spun all the way around, away from his microphone. On the next tune, \"Lover Man\", producer Ross Russell physically supported Parker. On \"Bebop\" (the final track Parker recorded that evening), he begins a solo with a solid first eight bars; on his second eight bars, however, he begins to struggle, and a desperate Howard McGhee, the trumpeter on this session, shouts, \"Blow!\" at him. Charles Mingus, however, considered this version of \"Lover Man\" to be among Parker's greatest recordings, despite its flaws. Nevertheless, Parker hated the recording and never forgave Ross Russell for releasing it. He re-recorded the tune in 1951 for Verve. Parker's life took a turn for the worse in March 1954 when his three-year-old daughter Pree died of cystic fibrosis and pneumonia. He attempted suicide twice in 1954, which once again landed him in a mental hospital.\n\nArtistry\nParker's style of composition involved interpolation of original melodies over existing jazz forms and standards, a practice known as contrafact and still common in jazz today. Examples include \"Ornithology\" (which borrows the chord progression of jazz standard \"How High the Moon\" and is said to be co-written with trumpet player Little Benny Harris), and \"Moose The Mooche\" (one of many Parker compositions based on the chord progression of \"I Got Rhythm\"). The practice was not uncommon prior to bebop, but it became a signature of the movement as artists began to move away from arranging popular standards and toward composing their own material. Perhaps Parker's most well-known contrafact is \"Koko\", which is based on the chord changes of the popular bebop tune \"Cherokee\", written by Ray Noble.\nWhile tunes such as \"Now's the Time\", \"Billie's Bounce\", \"Au Privave\", \"Barbados\", \"Relaxin' at Camarillo\", \"Bloomdido\", and \"Cool Blues\" were based on conventional 12-bar blues changes, Parker also created a unique version of the 12-bar blues for tunes such as \"Blues for Alice\", \"Laird Baird\", and \"Si Si.\" These unique chords are known popularly as \"Bird Changes\". Like his solos, some of his compositions are characterized by long, complex melodic lines and a minimum of repetition, although he did employ the use of repetition in some tunes, most notably \"Now's the Time\".\nParker contributed greatly to the modern jazz solo, one in which triplets and pick-up notes were used in unorthodox ways to lead into chord tones, affording the soloist more freedom to use passing tones, which soloists previously avoided. His recordings were used for a book of solo transcriptions, the posthumously published Charlie Parker Omnibook.\nOther well-known Parker compositions include \"Ah-Leu-Cha\", \"Anthropology\" (co-written with Gillespie), \"Confirmation\", \"Constellation\", \"Moose the Mooche\", \"Scrapple from the Apple\" and \"Yardbird Suite\", the vocal version of which is called \"What Price Love\", with lyrics by Parker.\nMiles Davis once said, \"You can tell the history of jazz in four words: Louis Armstrong. Charlie Parker\".\n\nDiscography\nRecognition\nAwards\nGrammy Award\n\nGrammy Hall of Fame\nRecordings of Charlie Parker were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, which is a special Grammy award established in 1973 to honor recordings that are at least twenty-five years old, and that have \"qualitative or historical significance\".\n\nInductions\n\nGovernment honors\nIn 1995, the U.S. Postal Service issued a 32-cent commemorative postage stamp in Parker's honor.\nIn 2002, the Library of Congress honored his recording \"Ko-Ko\" (1945) by adding it to the National Recording Registry.\n\nCharlie Parker residence\nFrom 1950 to 1954, Parker lived with Chan Berg on the ground floor of the townhouse at 151 Avenue B, across from Tompkins Square Park in Manhattan's East Village. The Gothic Revival building, which was built about 1849, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994 and was designated a New York City landmark in 1999. Avenue B between East 9th and East 10th Streets was given the honorary designation \"Charlie Parker Place\" in 1992.\n\nMusical tributes\nJack Kerouac's spoken poem \"Charlie Parker\" to backing piano by Steve Allen on Poetry for the Beat Generation (1959)\nIn 2014, saxophonist and bandleader Aaron Johnson produced historically accurate recreations of the Charlie Parker with Strings albums.\nLennie Tristano's overdubbed solo piano piece \"Requiem\" was recorded in tribute to Parker shortly after his death.\nAmerican composer Moondog wrote his famous \"Bird's Lament\" in his memory; published on the 1969 album Moondog.\nSince 1972, the Californian ensemble Supersax harmonized many of Parker's improvisations for a five-piece saxophone section.\nIn 1979, guitarist Joe Pass released his album I Remember Charlie Parker in Parker's honor.\nWeather Report's jazz fusion track and highly acclaimed big band standard \"Birdland\", from the Heavy Weather album (1977), was a dedication by bandleader Joe Zawinul to both Charlie Parker and the New York 52nd Street club itself.\nThe biographical song \"Parker's Band\" was recorded by Steely Dan on its 1974 album Pretzel Logic.\nAvant-garde jazz trombonist George E. Lewis recorded Homage to Charles Parker (1979).\nThe opera Charlie Parker's Yardbird by Daniel Schnyder, libretto by Bridgette A. Wimberly, was premiered by Opera Philadelphia on June 5, 2015, with Lawrence Brownlee in the title role.\nThe name of British 1960s blues-rock band The Yardbirds was at least partially inspired by Parker's nickname.\nCharles Mingus' song \"Reincarnation of a Lovebird\"\nIn 1993, Anthony Braxton recorded a 2-CD album titled Charlie Parker Project, released in 1995. This material was re-released in 2018 as part of an 11-CD set titled Sextet (Parker) 1993.\n\nOther tributes\nIn 1949, the New York night club Birdland was named in his honor. Three years later, George Shearing wrote \"Lullaby of Birdland\", named for both Parker and the nightclub.\nThe 1957 short story \"Sonny's Blues\" by James Baldwin features a jazz/blues playing virtuoso who names Bird as the \"greatest\" jazz musician, whose style he hopes to emulate.\nIn 1959, Jack Kerouac completed his only full-length poetry work, Mexico City Blues, with two poems about Parker's importance, writing in those works that Parker's contribution to music was comparable to Ludwig van Beethoven's.\nThe 1959 Beat comedy album How to Speak Hip, by comedians Del Close and John Brent, lists the three top most \"uncool\" actions (both in the audio and in the liner notes) as follows: \"It is uncool to claim that you used to room with Bird. It is uncool to claim that you have Bird's axe. It is even less cool to ask 'Who is Bird?'\"\nA memorial to Parker was dedicated in 1999 in Kansas City at 17th Terrace and The Paseo, near the American Jazz Museum located at 18th and Vine, featuring a 10-foot (3 m) tall bronze head sculpted by Robert Graham.\nThe Charlie Parker Jazz Festival is a free two-day music festival that takes place every summer on the last weekend of August in Manhattan, New York City, at Marcus Garvey Park in Harlem and Tompkins Square Park on the Lower East Side, sponsored by the non-profit organization City Parks Foundation.\nThe Annual Charlie Parker Celebration is an annual festival held in Kansas City, Kansas since 2014. It is held for 10 days and celebrates all aspects of Parker, from live jazz music and bootcamps, to tours of his haunts in the city, to exhibits at the American Jazz Museum.\nIn the short-story collection Las armas secretas (The Secret Weapons), Julio Cortázar dedicated \"El perseguidor\" (\"The Pursuer\") to Charlie Parker.

    "text": "Réseaux IP Européens (RIPE, French for \"European IP Networks\") is a forum open to all parties with an interest in the technical development of the Internet. The RIPE community's objective is to ensure that the administrative and technical coordination necessary to maintain and develop the Internet continues. It is not a standards body like the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and does not deal with domain names like ICANN.\nRIPE is not a legal entity and has no formal membership. This means that anybody who is interested in the work of RIPE can participate through mailing lists and by attending meetings. RIPE has a chair to keep an eye on work between RIPE meetings and to act as its external liaison. Rob Blokzijl, who was instrumental in the formation of RIPE, was the initial chair and remained in that position until 2014, when he appointed Hans Petter Holen as his successor. The RIPE community interacts via RIPE Mailing Lists, RIPE Working Groups, and RIPE Meetings.\nAlthough similar in name, the RIPE NCC and RIPE are separate entities. The RIPE NCC provides administrative support to RIPE, such as the facilitation of RIPE meetings and providing administrative support to RIPE Working Groups. It was established in 1992 by the RIPE community to serve as an administrative body.\n\nHistory\nThe name is a translation of the English title of a diagram to French by John Quarterman. This was presented in Special Session of RIPE 58.\nThe first RIPE meeting was held on 22 May 1989 in Amsterdam, Netherlands. It brought together 14 representatives of 6 countries and 11 networks At the time European governments, standardisation bodies and telecommunications companies were pushing for the OSI standard and IP-based networks were seen as the wrong way to go. In the academic community (mostly nuclear and particle physics) there was a strong need to work together with colleagues across Europe and the United States. IP provided a standard to allow interconnection and cooperation, whereas the networks offered by the European telecommunications companies often completely lacked that.\n\nRIPE as an organisation was established by the RIPE terms of reference, which were agreed on 29 November 1989. There were ten organisations intending to participate in  the RIPE Coordinating Committee, along the lines defined by the RIPE Terms of Reference, though some still needed to make a formal decision. These organisations were: BelWue,  CERN, EASInet, EUnet, GARR, HEPnet, NORDUnet, SURFnet, SWITCH and XLINK. At the same time task forces were established to facilitate the interconnection of European IP-networks in the following weeks and months. The four task forces were:\n\nConnectivity and Routing\nNetwork Management and Operations\nDomain Name System\nFormal Coordination\nOne of the results was a proposal on 16 September 1990 to establish the RIPE Network Coordination Centre (NCC) to support the administrative tasks in the RIPE community and the first RIPE NCC Activity Plan was published in May 1991.\nRIPE asked RARE (one of the predecessors of TERENA) if they would provide the legal framework for the RIPE NCC. After a solicitation procedure, the RIPE NCC began in April 1992 with its headquarters in Amsterdam, Daniel Karrenberg as manager and only two other staff members. Initial funding was provided by the academic networks (RARE members), EARN and EUnet. The RIPE NCC was formally established when the Dutch version of the articles of association was deposited with the Amsterdam Chamber of Commerce on 12 November 1997.\n\nFunction\nAny document, proposal, procedure or policy that has been proposed and accepted by the RIPE community is published online in the RIPE Document Store.\nThe RIPE community develops and sets policies for the technical coordination of the Internet and the management and distribution of Internet resources (IP addresses and Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs)) through an established, open, bottom-up process of discussion and consensus-based decision-making. The RIPE Policy Development Process (PDP) formally tracks input into and discussion on any policy proposed. The RIPE PDP is transparent and consensus-based. Anyone may suggest a new policy or a change to an existing one. Proposals are then discussed and accepted or rejected by the RIPE community according to the RIPE PDP guidelines.\nRIPE meetings happen twice a year in different locations throughout the RIPE NCC service region. The meetings are five-day events in which Internet service providers (ISPs), network operators, government representatives, regulators and other interested parties gather to discuss relevant issues, developments and policies. RIPE Meetings are open to anyone, although registration is required.\nThe RIPE community has formed a number of  RIPE Working Groups to deal with various issues and topics related to the work of RIPE NCC members and the general Internet community. Each of the RIPE Working Groups has a mailing list where topics or questions related to the working group can be discussed. The RIPE Working Groups meet twice a year in dedicated sessions at RIPE Meetings.\nThe RIPE community refers collectively to the individuals or organisations, whether members of the RIPE NCC or not, that have an interest in the way the Internet is managed, structured or governed.\n\nRIPE NCC\nThe regional Internet registry for Europe, the Middle East and parts of Central Asia.

    "text": "Burauen (IPA: [bu'ɾaʊen]), officially the Municipality of Burauen (Waray: Bungto han Burauen; Tagalog: Bayan ng Burauen), is a First Income Class municipality in the province of Leyte, Philippines. According to the 2024 census, it has a population of 54,635 people.\n\nEtymology\nThe name “Burauen” evolved from the word “haru” which means “spring”. This is because Burauen is the fountainhead of several rivers: the big Daguitan and Marabong rivers, the Guinarona and Hibuga rivers that pass through several neighboring towns, as well as several smaller ones. The legend behind the name speaks of a drought when several tributaries of these rivers dried up, forcing people to flock to a cluster of large springs in the town. The place was duly called “Buraburon” which, according to Justice Norberto Lopez Romualdez Sr., is the “multiplicative construction of the word “haru” (spring), which indicates “abundance”. Over the years, the name “Buraburon” (“having many springs”) evolved into “Burawon” and finally into “Burauen”.\n\nElected Officials\nHistory\nEarly settlers\nClandestine diggings conducted by antique hunters and verified by the National Museum archaeologists yield valuable artifacts consisting of chinaware and jars. Some of the discoveries were Stone Age artifacts and implements.  These antiques and artifacts were found on the plateaus of both sides of the Kag-oloolo Brook of Barangay Patag and Villa Aurora, which were about 16 kilometers southwest of the poblacion of Burauen. Similar artifacts were found in Barangay Paghudlan which is 12 kilometers from the Kag-oloolo. The earlier diggings on the south western portion of the poblacion, and those in Barangay Tambuco and Armasen unearth several precious antiques.  With the extensive presence of these artifacts over the said areas, the past locations of the early settlements in Burauen during the prehistoric epoch are indicated.\n\nSpanish regime\nThe Jesuit friars discovered Burauen as settlement in the later part of 1595 when they used the community as a base in the Christianization of the central part of Leyte.  Between years 1609 to 1616 Burauen was the most populous town of Leyte and Samar and it consistently registered the highest tax collection during the same period in the region. From Buraburon, the settlers were told by the Jesuit Missionaries to transfer to “Armasen” (meaning a trading place that is at the same time a granary), presently a sitio of Barangay Libas, which was similarly named today. Due to frequent flooding of the area by the Guinarona River, and to facilitate their “reducción de las visitas”, they transferred to the site of the present Barangay Malabca and led by Tamdon and his brother Hangdon who were the children of the last Rajah.\n\nFilipino - American War\nThe short-lived Philippine Republic proclaimed on June 12, 1898, face a new enemy, the American who were pursuing their so-called “Manifest Destiny” The troops of the Revolutionary Army under General Ambrosio Mojica, realizing that their fortification of “estacas” (bamboo palisades) around the poblacion of Burauen were weak, they force to withdraw to the mountains.  Several encounters occur during the Filipino-American War, the American burned the poblacion on July 4, 1900, sparing only the Catholic Church, its convent, the warehouses and the building of the Smith Bell and Co. and Chinese merchandizing.  This incident made Burauen one of the strongholds of the “Pulahan” dissidents.\nWith the cessation of hostilities, the people devoted their efforts to the reconstruction of their homes and expansion of their farms to usher progress of the municipality.  The productive endeavors of the people lured many enterprises to the town. The first Electric System and cinematographic house in Leyte and Samar were established in Burauen in 1916.  In 1928 Burauen Academy, the first secondary school in the municipality was founded. The different municipal administrations of the time were able to put up irrigation system in 1912. Constructed a big public market in 1918, erect a concrete municipal building in 1925 and build concrete school building in 1928. the income of the municipality in 1918 to 1928 was bigger than the income of the whole province of Surigao, this due to the wide area of abacá plantation of that time. This boomtown prosperity of Burauen lasted until 1929 when the great depression took place.\n\nWorld War II\nThe outbreak of World War II stunted the economic growth of Burauen. The Japanese Military encamped the eastern part of the poblacion there were many encounters between the Japanese forces and the guerillas who were firmly established in their mountain strongholds. In August 1944, the Japanese established a \"comfort station\" in the town, where the invaders enslaved local girls, teens, and young adults into becoming sex slaves called \"comfort women\", who were routinely gang-raped and murdered by Japanese soldiers. During the Allied Forces liberation of Leyte on October 20, 1944, Burauen was among the most heavily devastated towns in Leyte, thousands of civilians were killed and a number of properties were destroyed.\n\nPost-war period to present\nRising from the ruins of war, the municipality rehabilitated its homes and agriculture, hand in hand with the improvement of its institution and facilities.  In 1946, the Burauen High School was founded, followed by the rehabilitation of the Gabaldon school building, and the construction and operation of the water system in 1948.  The private sector contributed in the field of education in 1950 the Burauen Institute and the Rizal Colleges were founded.  The progress of the town suffered a setback in the middle part of 1951 when a very strong typhoon hit Burauen, which was followed by four others that were equally ravaging.  In 1952, despite financial hardships, the municipal government was able to repair the municipal building from its own funds but generally, the recovery of the municipality was very slow. On March 2, 1962, the Rural Bank of Burauen was established, the first rural bank in Leyte and Samar. A decade after, on April 1, 1972, the Burauen District Hospital was opened to accept its first patient.  During the intervening years and onward, road and bridges construction and street concreting in the poblacion and the Barangays alike were pursued, together with the construction of school building and health centers.  The public market area as well as the irrigation system was expanded.\n\nTimeline\nIn 1595, Spanish Jesuit Friars discovered the settlement of Burauen.  Its community was used as their base in the Christianisation on the central part of Leyte.\nBetween the years 1609 to 1616 Burauen was the most populous town of Leyte and Samar and it consistently registered the highest tax collection during the same period in the region.\nIn 1873, from being a missionary church under the diocese of Dagami, Burauen was carved out and declared as a separate town.\nIn 1912, municipal administrations of that time were able to put up irrigation system.\nIn 1916, the first electric system and cinematographic house in Leyte and Samar was established in Burauen.\nIn 1918, La Paz detached itself from Burauen to become an independent municipality.\nIn 1928, the Burauen Academy, the first secondary school in the municipality was founded.\nIn 1949, or just a few years after world war 2, President Elpidio Quirino issued an executive order no.278 separating Julita from burauen.\nIn 1962, the Rural Bank of Burauen was established. Making it the very first rural bank in both islands of Samar and Leyte.\n\nGeography\nBurauen is located in the central part of Leyte Island, bounded to the north by Dagami and Tabon-tabon, on the east by Julita, south by La Paz and Macarthur, on the west by Albuera and Ormoc City and on the southwest by Baybay City.\n\nBarangays\nBurauen is politically subdivided into 77 barangays.  Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.\n\nClimate\nDemographics\nThe municipality of Burauen, Leyte had a total population of 52,511 persons based on the 2020 Census of Population and Housing (2020 CPH). The household population of 52,359 persons comprised 99.7 percent of the total population recorded as of the time of census-taking.\nOf the 52,359 household population in Burauen, Leyte, 26,930 (51.4%) were males while 25,429 (48.6%) were females. By age group, 17,593 (33.6%) were under 15 years of age (young dependents). On the other hand, persons aged 15 to 64 years (working-age or economically-active population) totaled to 31,650 (60.4%) while those in age groups 65 years and over (old dependents) comprised the remaining 3,116 (6.0%). In 2015, persons aged 0 to 14 years, 15 to 64 years, and 65 years and over accounted for 34.3 percent, 60.2 percent, and 5.5 percent, respectively, of the household.\nMoreover, there were more males (47.5%) than females (43.4%) among the 0 to 59 age group. However, among the older age group (60 years and over), females (5.2%) outnumbered the males (3.9%). The same trend was also observed in 2015.\n\nSex ratio stands at 106 males per 100 females\nThe sex ratio in Burauen, Leyte was computed at 106 in 2020. This means that there were 106 males for every 100 females. The sex ratio in 2015 was also computed at 106 males per 100 females.\nIn 2020, children aged below 15 years had a sex ratio of 108 males per 100 females. On the other hand, those aged 15 to 64 years had a sex ratio of 110 males per 100 females. Moreover, among those aged 65 years and over, the sex ratio was 65 males per 100 females. This depicts a longer life expectancy among females than males or a higher mortality rate among males than females in the older age groups.\n\nThere were more males than females in children under five years old\nThe sex ratio for children under five years old in 2020 was 110 males per 100 females, higher than the 2015 ratio of 109 males per 100 females. Additionally, children under five comprised 11.3 percent (5,910 persons) of the household population in 2020, a decrease from 11.7 percent (6,190 persons) in 2015.\n\nMedian age measures at 23.0 years\nThe median age of Burauen, Leyte household population continues to increase during the past three censuses. In 2020, the median age was computed at 23.0 years, which means that half of the household population was younger than 23.0 years, while the other half is older than 23.0 years. This is higher than the median ages of 22.2 and 21.7 years that was posted in 2015 and 2010, respectively.\n\nDependency ratio decreases to 65 dependents per 100 persons in the working-age group\nThe 2020 overall dependency ratio of Burauen, Leyte was computed at 65, which indicates that for every 100 working-age or economically-active population, there were about 65 dependents (55 young dependents and 10 old dependents). This is lower than the dependency ratio in 2015, which was recorded at 66 dependents per 100 working-age population (57 young dependents and 9 old dependents).\n\nTwo in every five household population are of school age\nIn 2020, the school-age population (5 to 24 years old) accounted for 21,481 (41.0%) of the household population which is lower compared to the 22,422 (42.5%) school-age population that was reported in 2015. Moreover, there were more males (51.6%) than females (48.4%) of the school-age population in 2020.\n\nSenior citizens accounts for 9.1 percent of the household population\nIn Burauen, Leyte, people aged 60 years old and over are regarded as senior citizens, made up 9.1 percent (4,784 persons) of the household population in 2020, lower than the 8.0 percent (4,221 persons) recorded in 2015. There were more females (57.0%) than males (43.0%) among the senior citizens in 2020. The same trend was observed in 2015.\n\nNearly half of the female population are of reproductive age\nWomen of reproductive age (15 to 49 years old) totaled to 12,198 or 48.0 percent of the 25,429 female household population in 2020. This percentage was lower compared to the 48.8 percent or 12,492 females posted in 2015.In 2020, the school-age population (5 to 24 years old) accounted for 21,481 (41.0%) of the household population which is lower compared to the 22,422 (42.5%) school-age population that was reported in 2015. Moreover, there were more males (51.6%) than females (48.4%) of the school-age population in 2020.\n\nAging index is higher by 3.9 percentage points from 23.3 in 2015 to 27.2 in 2020\nIn Burauen, Leyte, the aging index or the proportion of persons aged 60 years and over per 100 persons under the age of 15 years was computed at 27.2 percent in 2020. This means that there is about one (1) person aged 60 years and over for every four (4) children under 15 years old.\n\nReligion\nBurauen's population are predominantly Roman Catholics while the remaining are Protestants of various denominations either adherents of the non-trinitarian sect Iglesia ni Cristo, Mormons, Baptists, Menonites and others.\n\nEconomy\nBurauen's economy predominantly relies on agriculture. Before Typhoon Haiyan struck the Province of Leyte, Copra and Abaca were the most valued traded goods of the town. But after the onslaught, most Abaca and Coconut crops were heavily devastated, coupled with plaguing disease on Abaca. People shifted to commerce and services. Today, Burauen has a vibrant commerce industry contributing a significant amount to the local economy.\nTourism is a growing economic driver in Burauen, currently undergoing enhancement and continuous development. With extensive promotion and expert support, the town is off to a good start in marketing itself as the spring capital of Leyte.\n\nLSR (Locally Sourced Revenue)\nBurauen was able to achieve a historical feat by generating more than a hundred million in Locally Sourced Revenue for two consecutive years and topping the list of all Municipalities in Eastern Visayas by Generated LSR Value for the year 2023. As such, the town was able to pass the required criteria for cityhood, making the town eligible to file a cityhood bill.\n\nCMCI - Cities and Municipalities Competitiveness Index\nAccording to the Cities and Municipalities Competitiveness Index Report, Burauen has consistently been one of the top performers in the region and in the province since the ranking started in 2013. The town has been the top performer in Leyte for the selected years of 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2021. Making it the only town in the province to hold the top spot for 3 consecutive years and another one in the year 2021, making the total of 4 1st placements and consistently being in the top 10 since CMCI started in 2013.\n\nCities and municipalities competitiveness index ranking\nEnvironment, sanitation, and natural resources\nMunicipal sanitary land fill site\nWith the enactment of RA-9003 otherwise known as The Ecological and Solid Waste Management Act of 2000, and in compliance as mandated by the law, the Local Government Unit of the Municipality of Burauen has constructed 1.20 hectares of land for the Municipality’s Sanitary Land Fill Site (SLFS) at Brgy. Gamay. The constructed Land Fill Site is in accordance to the national standard in so far as to the waste/garbage disposal is concerned. It has the necessary Environmental Clearance Certificate (ECC) from the Environmental Management Bureau of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (EMB-DENR). The SLFS was open for operation on April 2015.\n\nInfrastructure\nAccording to the 2019 Cities and Municipalities Competitiveness Index, Burauen posted the highest score in the province and second in the region in terms of infrastructure quality and development.\nThe town's roadways are mostly paved, with a few remaining upland and lowland areas unpaved due to several factors, such as land disputes and budgetary constraints. Almost each barangay has adequate public infrastructure, including covered public basketball courts that also serve as evacuation centers during calamities.\n\nTourism\nThe Local Government Unit of Burauen has been consulting with industry experts on how to develop the town's eco-tourism sites in a sustainable manner to carry out the Burauen Eco-tourism and Sustainable Tourism (BEST) project.\nWith extensive promotion and backing of experts, Burauen is off to a good start in its goal to market and cement the town's status as the spring capital of Leyte.\nOther identified eco-tourism sites are in the villages of Matin-ao, Tambis, Villa Rosas, Abuyogon, Cansiboy, and Kagbana. These areas are seen as an addition to a site proclaimed as a national park in 1937.\nNotable persons supporting the initiative are former actress and UN Sustainable Development Goals Advocate Antonette Taus, former Tourism Secretary Mina Gabor, and Asean Center for Biodiversity Director Mundita Lim.\n\nAttractions\nMahagnao Volcano Natural Park\nBurauen's upland territories are composed of wetland forests that contain thousands of century old trees, unique species of birds and mammals, plants and marine species mostly scattered inside Mahagnao Volcano Natural Park. It is also has with many natural sites such as lakes, mountain ranges, rivers, waterfalls, hot springs and a volcano. MVNP has an elevation of 1,200 meters above sea level and an area of 635 hectares, within the boundaries of Burauen, La Paz and McArthur towns.\n\nMahagnao Volcano\nMahagnao Volcano is a dormant volcano located in Barangay Mahagnao, more than 30 km away from the town proper. Although the volcano has been inactive, it is still classified as potentially active due to the active thermal features of the mountain. Tourist are allowed to hike on its peak.\n\nMalagsum Lake\nThis lake is smaller compared to the other one. It is a highly acidic lake which contains high level of sulfuric acid making it impossible for marine lives or some organisms to thrive. Except for the hundreds to thousands of wild docks making it as breeding ground or a home for migratory birds during migrating season.\nMahagnao Lake\n\nThis lake serves as the main source of marine products for the locals and also the center of its tourism activities. Several resorts owned privately or by community associations are on the lakeshore.\nMatigbao Lake\nIt is the smallest of the three lakes inside the park. But it is also the farthest and the most challenging to have a trek.\nDue to being isolated, the environment is quite different from what commonly seen in the rest of the park. There are numerous species of plants and insects thriving within the vicinity (such as dragonflies).\nCalor Hot spring\nThe spring is just located at the southern foot of the volcano. It was a system of springs heated by an active thermal feature. Thus, creating a hot spring that merges to another system of spring creating a river of hot spring.\nGuin-aniban Falls\nThe waterfall is located few kilometers on the southeast. It is the water from the Mahagnao lake which is passing to systems of rivers then merge before approaching on the mouth of the cliff creating a water fall that directly flow on the larger river called Marabong.\n\nHeritage and Historical Monuments\nNorberto Romualdez Sr. park\nIn his honor, June 6 every year was declared Norberto Romualdez Sr. Day.\nOn June 14, 2024, Mayor Juanito E. Renomeron inaugurated the restored 177-square meter park built in 1975, beside the 1600 Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception Church along the corner of Santa Ana and Ave Maria Streets, the exact site of his 1800s ancestral house. It is named after Norberto Romualdez. It was first improved in 2022 with the assistance of the National Historical Commission of the Philippines assistance. Romualdez' monument with a 1975 NHCP installed marker stands as the centerpiece with pavilion, concrete benches and a path walk.\n\nHealthcare\nBurauen healthcare needs are served by both the private and government owned health institutions.\n\nBurauen District Hospital (managed by the Provincial Government of Leyte)\nBurauen Rural Heath Unit (managed by the LGU of Burauen)\n\nBarangay Health Centers (with presence in each barangays of Burauen)\nBurauen Health and Wellness Hospital (Underconstruction as of August 2024 funded by LGU)\nWhile there are also several Private health facilities that catering Burawanons and nearby towns scattered all over the Poblacion.\n\nEducation\nBurauen's educational institutions is one of the largest when it comes to the size of enrollment and the teacher to student ratio.\nThe town is served by both public and private educational institutions.\n\nTertiary\nEVSU-Burauen Campus\nBurauen Community College\nTESDA Burauen (Vocational)\n\nSecondary\nBurauen Comprehensive National Highschool (BCNHS)\nBurauen National Highschool (BNHS)\nHibunauan National Highschool\nBuraburon National Highschool\nArmasen National Highschool\n\nPrimary\nImmaculate Conception Academy of Burauen Inc.\nMorningside School\nLeyte Samar Center for Change Foundation Inc.\nSaint Claire Child Development Center Burauen Leyte Inc.\nAll of Burauen's 77 barangays have public primary schools.

    "title": "Elwin Hermanson",
    "text": "Elwin Norris Hermanson (born August 22, 1952) is a former Canadian politician from Swift Current, Saskatchewan. He served as a member of Parliament (MP) for Kindersley—Lloydminster from 1993 to 1997 as a member of the Reform Party, and as a Member of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan for Rosetown-Elrose from 1999 to 2007 as a member of the Saskatchewan Party. Hermanson was the first permanent leader of the Saskatchewan Party and was leader of the Opposition from 1999 to 2004.\n\nPolitical career\nFederal politics\nHermanson first ran for political office in the 1988 Canadian federal election as a member of the fledgling Reform Party, a western protest party with a platform mixing western alienation with social conservatism. The party failed to have any members elected. However, Reform surged to third-party status in the 1993 election, and Hermanson was one of four Reform MPs elected in Saskatchewan. He was the Reform Party House Leader from 1993 to 1995. Following a redistribution he ran in the 1997 election in the new riding of Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar; while the Reform Party continued to attract voters, becoming the Official Opposition, Hermanson lost his seat to fellow incumbent Chris Axworthy of the New Democratic Party.\n\nSaskatchewan Party\nFollowing his federal election loss in 1997, Hermanson turned his attention to provincial politics. That year also saw the foundation of the Saskatchewan Party as a new conservative party in the province, bringing together former Progressive Conservatives, some Liberal members, and Reform Party organizers. Hermanson sought the leadership of the new party in 1998, facing off against Rod Gantefoer, a former Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan (MLA), and political newcomer Yogi Huyghebaert. On April 20, 1998, Hermanson was elected the first Saskatchewan Party leader in a one member, one vote election. Aware that the conservative base in the province was in rural areas, Hermanson stated that people \"know I have the best interests of the agriculture industry and rural Saskatchewan at heart because that's where I still live\". Hermanson did not have a seat in the legislature, and he declined to run in a 1998 Saskatoon by-election, instead waiting for the next general election to run for a seat. This left Ken Krawetz to serve as the interim House Opposition leader.\nUnder Hermanson, the Saskatchewan Party campaigned on an ambitious fiscal conservative platform, calling for major corporate and income tax cuts, along with a number of controversial and social conservative policies, from a commitment to consider privatizing crown corporations to work-for-welfare policies and an end to public affirmative action.\nHermanson was elected in the 1999 provincial election for Rosetown–Biggar and, leading the Saskatchewan Party to a strong performance, became Leader of the Opposition. The new party shocked the province in winning a small plurality of the popular vote, but it was completely shut out in the urban centres of Regina and Saskatoon. Ultimately, this left the Saskatchewan Party with 25 seats. However, the result reduced the Saskatchewan New Democratic Party (NDP) to a minority government with 29 seats, forcing Premier Roy Romanow to form a coalition government with the remaining Liberals.\nAfter this strong performance, Hermanson was widely expected to lead the party to victory in the next election, and the party led polling heading into 2003. The party again campaigned on a platform of tax reductions and decreased government involvement in the economy, but it remained bogged down by questions about its conservatism and its plans for crown corporations. Hermanson continued to state that he would be willing to entertain offers for the province's crown corporations and the NDP, now led by Lorne Calvert, made this a focal point of their campaign. At one point in the campaign, Hermanson criticized the NDP for a leaked internal cartoon that depicted him as a Nazi loading NDP sympathizers onto rail cars. Ultimately, the 2003 election would prove a major disappointment for the Saskatchewan Party as the NDP won a bare majority. While Hermanson's party made a net gain of two seats, both in Saskatoon, it was shut out of Regina once again. Hermanson resigned days after the election. However, he committed to remaining the MLA for Rosetown–Elrose. In March 2004, Hermanson was succeeded by Brad Wall when he was acclaimed the new Saskatchewan Party leader.\nOn June 23, 2006, Hermanson announced that he would not be seeking re-election to the legislature, marking the end of his run in provincial politics. Wall would lead the Saskatchewan Party to a majority government in the 2007 election, while party member Jim Reiter succeeded Hermanson as Rosetown–Elrose MLA.\n\nAfter politics\nIn 2007, Hermanson was appointed by the federal government to lead the Canadian Grain Commission for a five-year term beginning in January 2008.\nIn 2017, during the leadership race to replace Brad Wall as Saskatchewan Party leader, Hermanson was criticized for commenting on and sharing an Islamophobic article on Twitter. Leadership candidate Alanna Koch, whom Hermanson had endorsed, was among those vocally critical in response.\n\nElectoral record\nProvincial\nFederal\nReferences\nExternal links\nElwin Hermanson – Parliament of Canada biography",

    "title": "Hurricane Marilyn",
    "text": "Hurricane Marilyn  was the most powerful hurricane to strike the Virgin Islands since Hurricane Hugo of 1989, and the third such tropical cyclone in roughly a two-week time span to strike or impact the Leeward Islands, the others being Hurricane Iris and the much more powerful and destructive Hurricane Luis. The thirteenth named storm, seventh hurricane and third major hurricane of the extremely active 1995 Atlantic hurricane season, Marilyn formed on September 12 as a tropical depression from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on September 7. After formation, the storm quickly became a tropical storm, and steadily intensified into a hurricane by the time it struck the Lesser Antilles on September 14 at Category 1 strength. Entering the northeastern Caribbean Sea, rapid intensification ensued and it peaked on September 16 north of Puerto Rico as a Category 3 hurricane shortly after it had impacted the U.S. Virgin Islands. A Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance flight reported hail, which is unusual for tropical cyclones. After heading north past Bermuda, Marilyn weakened and became extratropical on September 22. The remnant circulation wandered the Atlantic Ocean from September 23 – October 1, just south of Nova Scotia.\nMarilyn is responsible for a total of thirteen deaths, most due to drowning on boats or offshore.\nEleven thousand people were left homeless on the island of St. Thomas, and estimated damages were set at $2 billion (1995 USD) in the USVI. The same area would be struck by Hurricane Bertha the next year, while still repairing from Hurricanes Luis and Marilyn, then successively hit by Hortense, Erika, Georges, Jose, Lenny and Debby.\n\nMeteorological history\nMarilyn's origins were from a tropical wave that formed off the African coast on September 7. Large, low-level winds were included in the wave's circulation, but little convection existed. The system continued west for a few days at about 19 mph (31 km/h) next to an anticyclonic aloft. On September 12, satellite pictures viewed the disorganized wave and declared it Tropical Depression Fifteen, after convection had increased. Tropical Depression Fifteen strengthened rapidly, becoming Tropical Storm Marilyn six hours later. One day after being named, Marilyn was upgraded to hurricane status, while turning on a more northwesterly track.\nFor the next few days, Marilyn's track took it towards the west-northwest and to the northwest, due to a weakness in the subtropical ridge. Marilyn was a Category 1 hurricane; it passed 52 mi (84 km) north of Barbados and Martinique. Marilyn passed over Dominica, and just Îles des Saintes and southwest of Guadeloupe on September 14, bringing heavy rains and strong winds with it. Marilyn continued on its northwesterly track, making landfall in the U.S. Virgin Islands on September 15, packing winds of 110 mph (180 km/h), a strong Category 2 strength hurricane. The eyewall, east-southeast of the center of Marilyn, passed over Saint Thomas later that day. After passing over Puerto Rico, Marilyn entered back into the Atlantic Ocean on September 16.\n\nA low had formed near Marilyn, which may have enhanced outflow from the system. An eye formed in the center of Marilyn, and the storm reached a peak intensity of 949 millibars and winds of 115 mph (185 km/h), a lower-end Category 3 hurricane. At this time, Marilyn was predicted to peak in wind speeds of 120–125 mph (193–201 km/h). Reconnaissance data found a concentric pair of eyewall wind maxima. Marilyn started weakening rapidly, falling from peak-level winds of 141 mph (227 km/h) down to 102 mph (164 km/h). The central pressure also rose up 20 mbars in only 10 hours. This rapid weakening was caused by westerly shear and dry air entrained in the system, a decaying eyewall, and especially cool waters upwelled from the previous powerful storm, Hurricane Luis. As Marilyn weakened to Category 1 hurricane status and moved north-northwest, it passed about 174 mi (280 km) west of Bermuda on September 19. As Marilyn encountered more westerly shear, it weakened to below hurricane status and made its extratropical transition on September 20, centered in the northeastern Atlantic. The remnant circulation continued to erratically move through the central Atlantic Ocean for another 10 days before being absorbed by a frontal low on September 30.\nA Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance flight reported hail, which is unusual for tropical cyclones.\n\nPreparations\nSeventeen watches and/or warnings were issued in association with Marilyn. The first two were a tropical storm watch and a tropical storm warning issued on Barbados, St. Vincent, Grenadines, St. Lucia and Grenada on September 12 at 2200 UTC. Five hours later, a tropical storm watch was issued for Trinidad and Tobago. A tropical storm warning was issued for St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Grenadines, Grenada and Tobago at 900 UTC September 13. At 2100 UTC, a Hurricane Warning was issued for Barbados, St. Vincent, Grenadines, St. Lucia and a hurricane watch for Dominica. A hurricane watch as released for Martinique on September 14. The 2100 UTC September 13 was extended for the Grenadines through St. Martin, except Guadeloupe, St. Barthelemy and French portion of St. Martin. At 1500 UTC, Puerto Rico was put under a Hurricane Watch. At 1700 UTC, Guadeloupe, St. Barthelemy, and French portion of St. Martin were put under a hurricane watch. Four hours later, Puerto Rico, U.S. and British Virgin Islands, and Guadeloupe were put under a hurricane warning.\nThroughout the night, several watches and warnings were discontinued. At 1500 UTC September 15, Dominican Republic from Cabrera to Cabo Engano were put under a hurricane watch as Marilyn approached. During the night of September 16, all currently active watches and warnings were discontinued. At around the same time, a new Hurricane watch was released for Turks and Caicos and Mayaguana, Acklins, and the Crooked Islands of the southeastern Bahamas. This warning was discontinued within 48 hours. At 1500 UTC September 18, Bermuda came under a Tropical Storm Watch, which was upgraded to a warning in six hours. The warning was discontinued on September 19.\nThe 250,000 residents of Barbados spent the night of September 13 in shelters.\n\nImpact\nMarilyn caused about $2.3 billion and 13 deaths throughout the United States Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. The exact figure for damages in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico is not available, although the American Insurance Services Group set the combined damage at $875 million. Aside from high winds and seas, one possible explanation for the storm's heavy damage may have been complacency on the part of local island populations. Marilyn struck a mere 10‑days after Luis, a more powerful Category 4 hurricane initially predicted to pass very close to St. Thomas. This prediction prompted locals to be particularly thorough in their pre-storm preparations; however, Luis passed further away from the island and caused relatively moderate damage. Virgin Islanders questioned the accuracy of the National Hurricane Center wind advisories, as Hurricane Marilyn caused significant damage for a mere \"category 2\" storm. Damage on St. Thomas was remiscent of the damage seen on St. Croix in 1989, when Hurricane Hugo, a category 4 storm, caused catastrophic damage. Because St. Thomas is a very hilly island, it is possible that sustained winds on exposed hills (some of which have elevations that are thousands of feet above sea level) were significantly stronger than the sea-level wind speed estimates given by the hurricane center in its main advisory. Residents also reported tornado vortices in certain neighborhoods.\n\nMartinique\nRainfalls in Martinique peaked at 9.06 in (230 mm) in Morne Rouge, 8.94 in (227 mm) in Ajoupa Bouillon, 6.4 in (160 mm) in Saint Pierre, ranging as low as 6 in (150 mm) in Ducos. The highest wind gust reported was 80 mph (130 km/h) in Trinite, the location of the only recorded sustained winds in Martinique, which was 58 mph (93 km/h).\n\nGuadeloupe\nHurricane Marilyn moved directly across Îles des Saintes and the southern part of Basse-Terre Island in the night of September 14–15, 1995, bringing the highest known rainfall totals to the island from a tropical cyclone.\nRainfalls over 12-hours in Guadeloupe were up to 20 in (510 mm) in Saint-Claude, 19.09 in (485 mm) in Guillard-Basse-Terre and 17.63 in (448 mm) in Gaba. The highest wind gust reported in Guadeloupe was 84 mph (135 km/h) in Marie-Galante. The next ones were near 52 mph (84 km/h) in Raizet with maximal wind gust at 68 and 61 mph (109 and 98 km/h) in Desirade. \nMinimal pressure recorded at 989 mbar (29.2 inHg) in Basse-Terre.\nDamage was moderate in the south, due to the massive amount of rainfall. Marilyn was one of the three hurricanes that affected the region in 1995, after Iris and Luis; the total estimated damage was near 500 million francs.\n\nU.S. Virgin Islands\nThe highest wind speed left by Marilyn after passing over the island of St. Croix was 100 mph (160 km/h). The highest rainfalls reported were 11.67 in (296 mm) in Annually, 9.96 in (253 mm) in Red Hook Bay and 5.25 in (133 mm) in Granard. The highest storm surge reported was 6.6 ft (2.0 m) in St. Thomas and 6.0 ft (1.8 m) in St. Croix. According to NOAA, The storm surge in the U.S. Virgin Islands reached 6 to 7 ft (2.1 m), with an isolated storm tide of 11.7 ft (3.6 m) reported on St. Croix. In St. Croix and St. Thomas, rainfall totals reached about 10 in.\nThe highest reported gusts were 129 mph (208 km/h) in a Noncommissioned Automated Surface Observing System and 95 mph (153 km/h) gusts in Sailboat Puffin at Green Cay. The highest sustained winds were 105 mph (169 km/h) in a Noncommissioned Automated Surface Observing System.\nMarilyn was directly responsible for seven deaths, most due to drowning on boats or offshore. Ten thousand people were left homeless on St. Thomas, and most buildings sustained some damage.\nThe island of St. Thomas was the hardest hit by the storm, where about 80% of the homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed, including the hospital and the water desalination plant; five people were killed. Storm surge in the Charlotte Amalie harbor beached the USCGC Point Ledge and damaged many smaller boats. Elsewhere in the territory, there was moderate to severe damage on St. Croix and St. John. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) estimated $1 billion in losses, while an economic research group in the U.S. Virgin Islands set the damage toll at $3 billion. Additionally, losses on St. Thomas were about $1.5 billion and for a total of $2 billion in the three U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nPuerto Rico\nThe highest rainfalls reported in Puerto Rico from Hurricane Marilyn were 5.6 in (140 mm) in Naguabo, 5.5 in (140 mm) in Luquillo Pico Del Este (Luquillo Pico Of the East), 2.52 in (64 mm) at Luis Muñoz International Airport, and 2.45 in (62 mm) at Roosevelt Roads Naval Station. The highest gusts reported were 125 mph (201 km/h) in Culebra, 60 mph (97 km/h) at Roosevelt Roads Naval Station and 50 mph (80 km/h) at a non-commissioned Automated Surface Observing System. The highest recorded sustained winds was 41 mph (66 km/h) at Roosevelt Roads Naval Station. Marilyn passed over the islands of Vieques and Culebra, where it caused much damage.\nThere were reports of extensive flash flooding across northern and eastern Puerto Rico, and 12,000 people were forced to ride out the storm in shelters. One person was killed in Culebra. President Bill Clinton declared Puerto Rico a federal disaster area, making it available to federal aid.\n100 homes on Culebra Island, 20 miles (32 km) east of Puerto Rico, were destroyed by Marilyn. Another two hundred homes on the island were damaged.\n\nAntigua\nThe highest reported gust in Antigua was 50 mph (80 km/h). The Antigua Meteorological Service reported that the island had extensive flooding and damage to banana trees. The other damage reported was from the wind.\n\nOther areas\nBermuda reported sustained winds of 45 mph and a highest gust of 60 mph (97 km/h). Antigua reported sustained winds of just 35 mph (56 km/h), tropical depression-strength. In St. Maarten, sustained winds were 42.5 mph (68.4 km/h) and the peak gust was 61 mph (98 km/h). Rainfalls in St. Maarten peaked at 3.35 in (85 mm) in an unknown location. The New York Times reported that the British Virgin Islands had little to no damage from Marilyn. The highest gust in Saint-Barthelemy was 59 mph (95 km/h) and the highest sustained winds of 45 mph (72 km/h) was reported.\n\nAftermath\nPuerto Rico\nRelief supplies in the wake of Hurricane Marilyn were sent to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Officials of FEMA set up camps on the islands to give out food, water and shelter supplies.\n\nU.S. Virgin Islands\nPresident of the United States Bill Clinton declared the U.S. Virgin Islands a federal disaster area, making it available to federal aid. However, the National Guard did not appear on St. Thomas until two days following the hurricane, and FEMA did not appear until three days following. In the meantime, significant looting, particularly of grocery stores, prevented an orderly distribution of food and water.\n Five supply distribution sites were being operated by the Virgin Islands Territorial Emergency Management Agency (VITEMA). More than 2,100 federal agency personnel had been deployed to help out with the cleanup from Hurricane Marilyn. Four contracts were quickly accepted for immediate building repairs. Diving teams were sent to check for harbor damage and United States Navy Seabees started working on repairing public buildings. Military and security forces included about 500 Army, Air Force, and Navy personnel, 500 National Guardsmen, and 500 federal law enforcement personnel. The airport in St. Thomas was open for flight using a mobile control tower. The St. Thomas hospital was open, but was running on generators.\nThe first FEMA Disaster Recovery Centers opened on September 23 on St. Thomas.

    "text": "Moreton is a village and civil parish in the Epping Forest district of Essex, England. It is located 3 miles (5 km) north-west of Chipping Ongar. At the 2021 census the parish had a population of 431.\n\nHistory\nThe village lies at a bridging point on the stream of Cripsey Brook, a tributary of the River Roding. A Roman road from Great Dunmow to London crossed the stream here. The modern bridge is a brick structure built in the 18th century.\nThere is no modern road, at this point, following the route of the Roman road out of the village, but the old road's route can be followed at Tawney Common a few miles to the south-west. Modern Moreton remains at the convergence of various minor roads, however, which link to Fyfield, to the east, Bobbingworth to the south, High Laver to the west and Matching to the north. Where the roads meet there remain several substantial village houses from the late Medieval / early modern period as well as two traditional English pubs, being the White Hart and the Nag's Head.\nDirectly to the east of the Nag's Head, Moreton features a primary school, which retains its small Victorian era main building, but in recent decades has grown as schools in neighbouring villages have been closed down.\nThe surrounding area is agricultural. There is also a seed processing plant that is just a short distance to the north of the village, which processes cereal, pulse, and oilseed rape seeds.  Apart from that, commercial activity has largely abandoned the village, and today many residents commute to Harlow, Loughton, Chelmsford or London.\nFor many years after petrol and diesel engined tractors became mainstream in England, Moreton retained a depot housing steam tractors (traction engines) but historical traction engines are no longer a feature of Moreton.\n\nGallery\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Moreton, Essex at Wikimedia Commons",

    "text": "Stefano Marchand (13 July 1755 – 1793) was a French merchant, whose journal of travels in the Pacific circa 1790-1792 was published in 1798 in Paris by Fleurieu.\nStefano was born in the then French colony of Grenada, and died in the then French colony of Mauritius. In his youth, he had traveled on merchant trade ships to the Antilles and India. On his return from Bengal in 1788, he met a captain Portlocke in St Helena who described his profitable trade in furs in the American Northwest. In December 1790, he was entrusted by a Marseille shipping group, Casa Baux, to travel on the vessel Solido to the American Northwest to trade for animal pelts. The first leg of his journey took him on June 12, 1791, past the Marquesas, from there traveling northwest, he claimed discovery of various islands previously visited by Captain Cook. His lengthy stays meant he only reached in August 7 to reach Cape of Edgecombe (near present-day Kruzof Island, Alaska). He proceeded north to Tchin Kitanae bay (also called Nordfolk Bay, now Sitka Sound), where he traded for otter pelts. He then moved to Nootka Sound and proceeded south along the coast. He left America on 8 September and made his way to the Hawaiian Islands. On 4 October he visited Oitaiti (Tahiti), and on 3 November reached Macao. However, Chinese authorities had prohibited the trading of fur at the port. He returned to France, stopping at Mauritius. He returned to Toulouse on 14 August 1792. While his trip was an economic failure, he was feted by the Revolutionary authorities for his travels.\nHis diaries were published as Viaggio a torno al mundi negli 1790, 1791, e 1792 di Stefano Marchand.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "Offshore drilling on the Atlantic coast of the United States",
    "text": "Offshore drilling for oil and gas on the Atlantic coast of the United States took place from 1947 to the early 1980s.  Oil companies drilled five wells in Atlantic Florida state waters and 51 exploratory wells on federal leases on the outer continental shelf of the Atlantic coast.  None of the wells were completed as producing wells. All the leases have now reverted to the government.\n\nAlthough no oil or gas have been produced from beneath U.S. Atlantic waters, there are active offshore fields to the south in offshore Cuba and to the north in offshore Canada.\nEach US state along the Atlantic coast owns as territorial waters out to three nautical miles (3.45 statute, or land miles) from the shore at mean low tide, and has jurisdiction to decide whether or not, and under what terms, to lease the territory for oil and gas.  The federal government owns and controls the minerals between three and 200 nautical miles (370 km) from the shore.\nIn accordance with congressional restrictions and presidential orders, no federal leasing has taken place on the offshore Atlantic coast of the United States since the early 1980s.  The federal government had scheduled a lease sale for offshore Virginia, to take place in 2011, and in March 2010, President Barack Obama announced his intention to open the Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic planning areas to oil and gas exploration. However, lease sale plans were canceled in May 2010 following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. In December 2010, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar announced a ban on drilling in federal waters off the Atlantic coast through 2017. In 2017 President Trump issued an executive order aimed to open and streamline oil exploration on the Atlantic coast and elsewhere, stating that \"It shall be the policy of the United States to encourage energy exploration and production\".[1]\n\nReserves\nNo oil or gas has been produced from the U.S. Atlantic continental shelf. Some gas discoveries were made by Tenneco, Texaco, and Exxon in shallow waters off New Jersey, but these were judged uneconomic at the time, and were never produced.\nA 2012 study by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) (part of the U.S. Department of the Interior) estimated undiscovered technically recoverable oil and gas resources in Atlantic federal waters to be 3.30 billion barrels of oil (Bbo) and 31.28 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of gas. This represents approximately 4% of the total estimated recoverable oil resources and 8% of the total estimated recoverable gas resources in U.S. federal waters.\n\nStraits of Florida\nFive wells were drilled in Florida state waters in the Straits of Florida (in waters off the Florida Keys) from 1946 to 1962.  Gulf Oil operated three wells in state waters south of the Florida Keys in 1959, 1960 and 1961, while Chevron (Calco) and Sinclair each operated one.  The wells were considered to be dry holes, however, oil shows were found in all the wells and live oil was tested in the State Lease 826Y-1.\nThe boundary between the Exclusive Economic Zones of the U.S. and Cuba is halfway between Cuba and Florida, as determined by a 1977 Modus vivendi between the U.S. and Cuba.\n\nOffshore Cuba\nCuba has three producing offshore oil fields within 5 km of its north coast opposite Florida.  The US Geological Survey estimates that the North Cuba Basin contains 5.5 billion barrels (870,000,000 m3) of undiscovered petroleum liquids and 9.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, almost all in the offshore part of the basin.\nThe issue of allowing oil and gas exploration offshore Florida became a hotly contested topic in the 2008 US elections.  In a column published 5 June 2008, syndicated columnist George Will wrote that a Chinese oil company was then drilling in Cuban waters 60 miles (97 km) from the Florida coast, a claim that was repeated by candidates in favor of offshore drilling.  George Will later acknowledged that no drilling was then taking place in that part of Cuban waters.\nIn 2004 the Spanish oil company Repsol-YPF drilled in deep Cuban waters between Cuba and the Florida Keys, and found an oil deposit; the deposit was judged noncommercial, and the hole was plugged. Repsol returned in 2012 to drill three more dry holes in deepwater locations in partnership with the Norwegian company Statoil, then halted further attempts.\nIn October 2008, Cuba signed an agreement with the Brazilian state oil company Petrobras, which provides for Petrobras to drill for oil and gas in deep waters off the north shore of Cuba. \nPetrobras obtained poor drilling results, and pulled out in March 2011.\nIn July 2009, Cuba signed an agreement with the Russian government giving the Russian oil company Zarubezhneft oil exploration rights in shallower waters closer to the north shore of Cuba. Zarubezhneft secured a shallow waster drilling rig and moved it to Cuba in late 2012. Zarubezhneft also failed to find new oil deposits, and announced in May 2013 that they were halting further drilling and releasing the rig. Cuban officials said that they expected Zarubezhneft to return to drilling in 2014.\n\nOffshore Bahamas\nIn 2009 the Falkland Islands-registered company BPC Limited and Norwegian company Statoil announced a joint venture to drill for oil in Bahamian waters north of Cuba and southeast of Florida. The government of the Bahamas has indicated that applications for offshore drilling are on hold pending negotiations with Cuba, the United States, and the Turks and Caicos Islands on the exact boundaries between their respective Exclusive Economic Zones.\n\nSouthern Atlantic coast\nThe first lease sale in the Southeast Georgia Embayment off the coast of Georgia and Florida was held in 1978.  Oil companies drilled seven wells, all dry holes.\nWhen President Biden took office in January 2021, he issued an executive order halting new oil and gas leases across federal lands and waters, but a federal judge in Louisiana immediately struck it down. The government then put up over 80 million acres of the Gulf of Mexico at auction, and companies bid on the right to drill in over 1.7 million offshore acres. In January 2022, however, a federal judge ruled that the Department of the Interior had underestimated the effects on climate and that the drilling could not proceed.\n\nMiddle Atlantic coast\nA number of oil companies bought federal leases offshore North Carolina, but in 1990 the U.S. Secretary of Commerce denied Mobil Oil permission to drill after Congress passed the federal North Carolina Outer Banks Protection Act, prohibiting leasing and drilling on federal seabed offshore from North Carolina.  Mobil and Marathon Oil sued the federal government to recover money paid for the leases.  \nIn June 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled for the oil companies in the Mobil Oil Exploration & Producing Southeast, Inc. v. United States, 530 U.S. 604 (2000), and ordered the federal government to repay $158 million. The government paid, and the companies relinquished the leases.\n\nNorth Atlantic coast\nAbout 30 wells explored the Baltimore Canyon Trough, about 100 miles (160 km) off the coast of New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia.  In one area, five wells tested significant flows of gas from Jurassic rocks, at rates as high as 18.9 million cubic feet  per day.  A 3-dimensional seismic survey was made over the area, but, in part due to falling gas prices in the 1980s, the lessee oil companies concluded that the tracts were uneconomic.  The last leases were relinquished in 1984. In 2022, the Baltimore Canyon Offshore area was identified by researchers as a \"carbon bomb,\" with the potential to produce 1.2 gigatons of CO2 emissions if its reserves were extracted and burnt.\nFrom 1976 though 1982, oil companies drilled ten exploratory wells in the U.S. portion of the Georges Bank Basin, about 120 miles (190 km) off the coast of Massachusetts.  The deepest well had a total depth of 21,874 feet (6,667 m).  None were successful.\n\nOffshore Atlantic Canada\nThe Canadian federal government and the province of Nova Scotia have jointly imposed a moratorium until 2015 on drilling in the Canadian portion of the Georges Bank.\nDrilling has taken place in offshore Atlantic Canada since 1967.  Gas was discovered on the Sable Offshore Energy Project (SOEP) offshore Nova Scotia in 1971, began producing natural gas in 2000, and is still producing.  A second natural gas field offshore Nova Scotia is expected to start delivering gas in 2010. Gas production required the construction of an undersea, offshore pipeline to link the production wells with gas markets. SOEP is owned by ExxonMobil Canada Limited (50.8%), Shell Canada Limited (31.3%), Imperial Oil Limited (9.0%), Pengrowth (8.4%) and Moshbacher Operating Limited (0.5%). The Sable Project produces between 400 and 500 million cubic feet of natural gas and 20,000 barrels (3,200 m3) of natural gas liquids every day.\nFarther northeast, major oil deposits have been discovered and are being produced in the Jeanne d'Arc Basin, offshore Newfoundland.  Offshore Newfoundland held 38% of Canada's conventional petroleum reserves (excluding oil sands) at the end of 2011.\n\nFuture lease sales\nThe Obama administration announced in March 2010 that it intended to open oil and gas leasing in the Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic planning areas.  However, in May 2010, following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the administration cancelled the only scheduled Atlantic lease sale, for an area offshore Virginia. On December 1, 2010, the Obama Administration closed Atlantic and eastern Gulf areas to drilling.\n\nOffshore Virginia\nCommercial oil and gas drilling has never occurred offshore Virginia.  Unlike the offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, which occurs in both state and federal waters, the proposed offshore Virginia drilling would be exclusively in Federal waters more than 50 miles (80 km) from the coast, and the state has not leased its state waters for drilling.  A second difference is that although federal law has been amended to share royalties in federal waters in the Gulf between the federal government and the adjacent state, all royalty revenues from any offshore drilling in federal Atlantic waters is not shared with the states.\n\nUnder the 5-year offshore leasing plan for 2007–2012, the MMS scheduled a lease sale for tracts 50 miles (80 km) or more off the coast of Virginia, to take place in 2011. Five companies applied to the MMS to conduct seismic exploration surveys off the U.S. Atlantic coast.  The MMS requested funding for an Environmental Impact Statement to decide whether of not to allow the proposed seismic surveys.\nThe possible offshore lease sale became an issue in the 2009 race for governor of Virginia.  The winner, Bob McDonnell, urged during his tenure that the sale take place.\nIn May 2010, President Obama announced his decision to cancel the offshore Virginia lease sale, in response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.  Obama had previously supported the lease sale.\n\nSee also\nOffshore oil and gas in the United States\nUnited States offshore drilling debate\nOffshore Energy and Jobs Act - bill introduced in Congress to expand offshore drilling in the Atlantic\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "The (second) Battle of Bornhöved took place on 22 July 1227 near Bornhöved in Holstein. Count Adolf IV of Schauenburg and Holstein — leading an army consisting of troops from the cities of Lübeck and Hamburg, Dithmarschen, Holstein, and various Northern German nobles, defeated King Valdemar II of Denmark and the Welf Otto the Child.\n\nBackground\nValdemar and his predecessor King Canute VI of Denmark had previously conquered Holstein, Mecklenburg, Hamburg, Lübeck (1202), Ratzeburg and the coast of Pomerania, including the island of Rügen.\n\nBattle\nThe contest was maintained with great firmness on both sides, and continued for an unusual length of time. The carnage was so great that its combatants are said to have fought knee deep in blood. The King of Denmark had one of his eyes shot out, and had several horses killed under him, but his troops and their allies fought with so much bravery that the victory would have been theirs had not the contingent from Dithmarschen deserted their colours. At the most critical moment of the action these troops passed over to the enemy, and the Danes were obliged to give way. In the confusion that followed Otto I, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and the Bishop of Ribe were taken prisoner. Otto was sent to Rostock, the capital of a lordship held by Mecklenburg, where he was shut up in a fortress. But the King of Denmark, who escaped from the field, busied himself in repairing this disaster by forming a fresh army, with which he kept the enemy in check.\n\nResult\nAs a result of the battle, the Danish border with the Holy Roman Empire was moved north again from river Elbe to the Eider River, the southern border of the Duchy of Schleswig. This border remained in effect until 1806. The victorious Adolf IV of Schauenburg regained the County of Holstein and his fellow victor Albert I, Duke of Saxony reasserted himself as liege lord of the Counts of Schauenburg and Holstein against the Welf claim. Dithmarschen shook off Danish supremacy and returned to a very loose overlordship by the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen, paving the way for its de facto autonomy as a peasant republic until 1559. The Principality of Rügen was the only possession in the Holy Roman Empire left to Valdemar after the battle.\n\nNotes\nReferences\n\nSir Andrew Halliday Annals of the House of Hannover, v.2, London, 1826.",

    "title": "'Akbara",
    "text": "'Akbara (Arabic: عكبرة) is an Arab village in the Israeli municipality of Safed, which included in 2010 more than 200 families. It is 2.5 km south of Safed City. The village was rebuilt in 1977, close to the old village destroyed in 1948 during  the 1947–1949 Palestine war.\n\nLocation\nThe village of 'Akbara was situated 2.5 km south of Safad, along the two sides of a deep wadi that ran north–south. Southeast of the village lay Khirbet al-'Uqeiba, identified as the Roman village Achabare, or Acchabaron. This khirba was a populated village as late as 1904.\n\nHistory\nThe first 'Akbara mention is during Second Temple period by Josephus Flavius, he noted the rock of Acchabaron (Ακχαβαρων πετραν) among the places in the Upper Galilee he fortified as a preparation for the First Jewish Revolt, while leading rebel forces against the Romans in Galilee. This site is identified with caves situated along the cliffs south of 'Akbara.\nThe nearby Khirbet al-'Uqeiba was first excavated during the Mandate period, and was shown to contain remains such as building foundations, hewn stones, and wine presses. Cisterns, tombs, oil press and walls of ancient synagogue  have also been found. Foerster identifies the ruins as the  \"early Galilean type\" synagogue. According to Liebner, a 1965 letter in the IAA composed by antiquities inspector N. Tfilinski notes a Hebrew inscription on a building stone found at the site. The current location of the stone is unknown.\nAbove the settlement, a 135 m high vertical cliff is located. There are one hundred and twenty-nine natural and man-made caves interconnected by passages in the cliff. According to tradition, those caves were used for shelter by Jews during their war with Romans. During archeological excavations, coins from Dor and Sepphoris were found in the caves, dating to the Roman emperor Trajan period.\nAkbara/Akbari/Akbora/Akborin is mentioned several times in Rabbinic literature as early as second half of the third century CE. According to some traditions Rabbi Yannai disciples lived in 'Akbara forming an agricultural community; R. Yannai established a bet midrash there. The earliest mention of this bet midrash is in the context of discussions between Rabbi Yohanan and sages of 'Akbara. According to Talmud school of Rabbi Jose bar Abin was also in Akbara.  Several of the rabbis mentioned in Pirkei Avot lived in 'Akbara. Akbara is mentioned as the burial place of several Talmudic sages: Rabbi Nehurai also Rabbi Yannai and Rabbi Dostai, his son, are buried \"in the gardens\" \"by the spring\".  According to tradition, the body of Rabbi Elazar ben Simeon was laying for twenty two years in his widow's garret in Akbara since he told her not to allow his colleagues to bury him. Rabbi Elazar ben Simeon feared to be dishonoured due to his aid to the Romans.\nThe local Jewish community is attested during Fatimid rule of 969 to 1099 by the Cairo Geniza. Samuel ben Samson visited 'Akbara during his 1210 Palestine pilgrimage, he described the tomb of Rabbi Meir he had found there.  In 1258 Jacob of Paris visited Akbara and found there, according to Pirkei Avot, tombs of Rabbi Nehurai.\n\nOttoman era\n'Akbara, was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517. Moshe Basola visited the village in 1522 and said that he had found there \"destroyed synagogue, 3 cubits high remaining on two sides\". Later in 1968 the remains of the synagogue were identified by Foester.  In the census of 1596, the village was part of the nahiya (\"subdistrict\") of Jira, part of Liwa Safad, with a population of 36 households and 1 bachelor, all Muslims. It paid taxes on a number of crops and produce, including wheat, barley, summer crops,   olives, occasional revenues, goats,  beehives, and a press which was either used for processing grapes or olives; a total of 6,115 akçe. 6/24 of the revenue went to a waqf.\n\nIn 1648 a Turkish traveler Evliya Tshelebi visited Galilee and reflected on history of Akbara cliff caves, which according to tradition were used as a shelter by Jews: \"The children of Israel escaped the plague and hid in\nthese caves. Then Allah sent them a bad spirit which caused them to perish within the caves. Their skeletons, heaped together, can be seen there to this day.\"In 1838, it was noted as a village in the Safad district, while in 1875 Victor Guérin visited, and described it thus: \"The ruins of Akbara cover a hillock whose slopes were formerly sustained by walls forming terraces; the threshing floors of an Arab village occupy the summit. Round these are grouped the remains of ancient constructions now overthrown.\"\n\"The village lies on the east of the wady. It is dominated by a platform on which foundations can be traced of a rectangular enclosure called el Kuneiseh, measuring thirty paces in length by twenty-three in breadth. It stands east and west, and was firmly constructed of good cut stones. The interior is at present given up to cultivation. This enclosure seems to have been once a Christian church.\"In 1881, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP)  described Akbara as a village built of stone and adobe with about 90 inhabitants who cultivated olive and fig trees.\nA population list from about 1887 showed Akbara to have about 335 inhabitants, all Muslims.\n\nBritish Mandate era\nIn the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Akbara  had a population of 147; all Muslims, increasing in the 1931 census to 275, still all  Muslims, in a total of 49 houses.\nDuring this period the village houses were made of masonry.  In the 1945 statistics the population was 390 Muslims, and the total land area was 3,224 dunums;  2,222 dunums was used for cereals, 199 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards, while 6 dunams were built-up (urban) land.\n\nIsraeli era\nDuring the siege of Safad 'Akbara was targeted for occupation in line with Plan Dalet. The Hagana attack was launched on 9 May and completed by the Palmach first battalion. It was found that many of the villagers had fled due to news of Deir Yassin and 'Ein al Zeitun, the village was then blown up and destroyed.\n\nOn 25 May 1948, during Operation Yiftah, under the command of Yigal Allon, Galilee was cleared of its Palestinian Arab population. The Palmach's First Battalion. Following the 25 May exodus of al-Khisas the last 55 villagers who had remained in their homes for just over a year were 'transferred' by Israeli forces despite having good relations and collaborating with Jewish settlements in the area. During the night of 5/6 June 1949, the village of al-Khisas was surrounded by trucks and the villagers were forced into the trucks ’with kicks, curses and maltreatment,’ in the words of a Mapam Knesset member, Elizer Peri, quoted by Morris: \"The remaining villagers said that they had been ’forced with their hands to destroy their dwellings,’ and had been treated like ’cattle.’ They were then dumped on a bare, sun-scorched hillside near the village of ’Akbara [by then an abandoned Palestinian Arab village] where they were left ’wandering in the wilderness, thirsty and hungry.’ They lived there under inhuman conditions for years afterwards,\" along with the inhabitants of at least two other villages (Qaddita and al-Ja'una) expelled in similar circumstances. The expellees remained at ’Akbara for eighteen years until agreeing to resettlement in Wadi Hamam.\n\nSalman Abu-Sitta, author of the Atlas of Palestine, estimated that the number of Palestinian refugees from 'Akbara in 1998 was 1,852 people.\nOf what remains of 'Akbara's built structures, Walid Khalidi wrote in 1992 that \"The original inhabitants of the village were replaced by 'internal' refugees from Qaddita villages several kilometers north of Safad. Since 1980, however, these internal refugees have been gradually relocated to the nearby, planned village of 'Akbara, 0.5 km west of the old village site. As a precondition of the relocation, each family was required to demolish its home in the former village. Today, fifteen of the old houses still stand on the site, in addition to the school. The new village of 'Akbara was placed under the administration of the city of Safad in 1977. It is now a neighbourhood of the city of Safed.\n\nSee also\nList of massacres committed during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war\nNahal Akbara\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n\nWelcome to Akbara\n'Akbara,  Zochrot\nSurvey of Western Palestine, Map 4: IAA, Wikimedia commons\n'Akbara,  at Khalil Sakakini Cultural Center\nAkbara,  Dr. Khalil Rizk.\n3akbara from Dr. Moslih Kanaaneh",

    "title": "Pure (Godflesh album)",
    "text": "Pure is the second studio album by English industrial metal band Godflesh. It was released on 13 April 1992 through Earache Records. Though originally labeled only as industrial metal, the album has since been recognised as one of the earliest post-metal releases. Musically, Pure is rhythmically mechanical and features harsh guitars, with protracted songs and an abundance of deliberate repetition. Like much of Godflesh's music, it is regarded as particularly heavy and aggressive, and these elements helped it gain critical acclaim.\nPure was supported by the promotional single of and music video for \"Mothra\", and the 1991 EP Cold World was recorded in the same sessions as the album. In 2013, Godflesh performed the majority of Pure live at Roadburn. Despite dissatisfaction with the production quality of the album, Godflesh frontman Justin Broadrick considers it one of the band's most honest releases. In 2012, Fact ranked Pure as the 64th best album of the 1990s.\n\nBackground\nAfter the release of Godflesh's first album, 1989's Streetcleaner, the band played concerts across Europe and eventually embarked on a 1991 tour of North America with labelmates Napalm Death. This was the first time frontman Justin Broadrick and bassist G. C. Green played in America, and the band were met with unexpected favour. Broadrick elaborated upon their reception in a 2010 interview with Exclaim, saying, \"By the time we got there, the band had already grown beyond my expectations, it was already becoming a popular band in the underground, which we hadn't really expected. It was very much a surprise for us that people responded so positively to the music\". It was this tour that solidified Godflesh as a full-time project, and once it was over, Broadrick and Green returned to the studio. After the release of the 1991 EP Slavestate, the band decided to focus on a second studio album. The resulting sessions led to another 1991 EP, Cold World, and Pure in 1992.\nWith Pure, Broadrick wanted to explore the experimental side of Godflesh. However, at the time, the band were limited to 8-track reel-to-reel recording tape, which stifled some of his ambitions. To make up for the technological deficit and recent departure of second guitarist Paul Neville, Loop guitarist Robert Hampson was brought in to provide additional instrumentation. Hampson ended up playing on only half of Pure, but the additions helped reinforce the album's overwhelming sound. Broadrick later said the introduction \"worked brilliantly\". The album's title comes from Broadrick's idea that purity (especially a child's view of it) is strength.\n\nComposition\nPure is often characterised for its harsh, discordant and mechanical sound, with many critics noting its extreme weight and inhospitable mood. Unlike Streetcleaner, which featured intentionally loose guitar playing, Pure is intensely structured, regimented and stiff, dominated by repetition; The Times of Northwest Indiana called it \"colossally repetitive\". The guitar tone, a sound first explored by Broadrick on the 1991 Godflesh single \"Slateman\", is tinny and deliberately grating. Outright riffs are rare, leaving Green's bass and the programmed drums to guide the songs. Mike Gitter of RIP Magazine and Spin described the album as \"a metal junkyard of strange harmonics and decayed muzak\", and he called the guitars malevolent, the drum machine ice-cold and the bass clanging. Gitter concluded by writing that Pure is \"two sides of technology gone amok that would rattle even Ministry's chain-link cage, and that makes Nine Inch Nails sound like the Pet Shop Boys!\" Hampson's and Broadrick's guitars often hang in the background, leading Pure to be a notably percussive album with hip hop-inspired elements. The Chicago Tribune said the album employed what sounded like \"a 20-ton rhythm machine\". Broadrick's vocals on Pure, which are typically sparse, come in two primary styles: guttural shouting and \"distant-sounding, voice-from-the-ether singing\".\n\"Spite\", the album's introductory track, begins with a jaunty hip hop loop that Kristi Siegel of the Tampa Bay Times compared to the percussion-heavy work of Skinny Puppy, a band that Godflesh briefly toured with before Pure. The lyrics of \"Spite\" are growled and direct, leading Broadrick to describe it as \"the most literal song I've ever written\" before calling it \"as base as I can get\". The second track and the album's only single, \"Mothra\", is a lively, driving song with some lyrics borrowed from Leonard Cohen's 1971 song \"Avalanche\". Shawn Macomber of Decibel recognised \"Mothra\" as a fan favourite, and Joseph Schafer of the same publication called the song \"a colossal chugging machine\" that sounds like \"getting crushed by a ton of lead\". The track's title is derived from Mothra, a fictional creature in the Godzilla franchise. Following that, \"I Wasn't Born to Follow\" is the first extended composition on the album; Sharon O'Connell of Melody Maker called it \"a dream with heavy tread\".\n\n\"Predominance\", the fourth track on Pure, is a highly aggressive song that Gitter said took the sound of rock \"to its bleakest and slowest extremes\". Jason Pettigrew of Alternative Press called the song a \"layered head-shock\", and O'Connell wrote that the song \"is all rough, rutting rhythm with a post-coital shudder fit to shift tectonic plates\". The title track (named one of the five best Godflesh songs by Decibel) is built around a rhythm sample from \"Let the Rhythm Hit 'Em\" (1990) by Eric B. & Rakim, and \"Monotremata\" is an exceptionally slow nine-minute song with a degree of heaviness that is, according to Noel Gardner of The Quietus, \"distinctive and inimitable\". In 2014, MetalSucks singled out \"Monotremata\" as a \"classic\". The album's seventh song, \"Baby Blue Eyes\", features a stilted dance groove, and it is followed by \"Don't Bring Me Flowers\", a bleak, funereal song that was deconstructed (or \"demixed\" as the liner notes put it) on Godflesh's 1994 EP Merciless. The album concludes with \"Love, Hate (Slugbaiting)\" and \"Pure II\", the latter of which is a twenty-minute ambient sprawl with faraway drums that, according to Ned Raggett of AllMusic, hit \"like a distant cannon\". Gitter called the piece \"a maximal approach to minimalism\" that was \"devastating\" and \"rips open a black hole\".\nWhile Pure is predominantly recognized as industrial metal, it has been cited as a key album to the post-metal genre, with some calling it one of the genre's founding releases. Jon Wiederhorn of Bandcamp wrote that it was \"Pure, with its more expansive structures and long stretches of billowing noise, that inspired countless metal-based groups to experiment with layered washes of sound.\" Regardless of impact, Broadrick has occasionally expressed dissatisfaction with the production of the album. In a 2014 interview with The Quietus, he said, \"My objections are the mixing. Not heavy enough. I was listening to a lot of hardcore hip hop at the time and I wanted the beats to be as heavy as that. That's my lingering dissatisfaction with that album.\" Still, when referring to what he considers and what he believes fans consider to be true Godflesh material, Broadrick often includes Pure. The album remains a staple of Godflesh's relatively picky live sets, with \"Spite\" and \"Mothra\" appearing most often.\n\nRelease\nPure was released on 13 April 1992. CD versions included two bonus tracks: \"Love, Hate (Slugbaiting)\", the first three minutes of which were taken from a 1986 live performance of a previous incarnation of Godflesh called Fall of Because, and the protracted ambient piece, \"Pure II\". Pure was reissued in August 2009 as part of a triple-CD package which also included the 1991 EPs Slavestate and Cold World. \"Mothra\", a song that Decibel magazine called one of Broadrick's most accessible, was released as a promotional single for the album. In 2013, Pure was played in its near entirety at Roadburn. Robert Hampson appeared and performed live with the band, playing on the songs which he originally contributed to. The Loop song \"Straight to Your Heart\", which had been covered by Godflesh on the bands' 1991 split EP Loopflesh/Fleshloop, was also played. On 2 November 2022, the band released this performance under the title Pure : Live.\n\nCritical reception\nPure received positive reviews upon release in 1992. Since then, its acclaim has grown. When the album came out, AllMusic reviewer Ned Raggett wrote, \"In terms of grinding guitars and shouted vocals [...] it's pure Godflesh ire.\" In another contemporary review, Melody Maker writer Sharon O'Connell praised Pure for its weight, rhythm and ability to cover traditionally miserable topics in a \"strangely life-affirming, almost soaringly spiritual\" way. Also writing in 1992, Mike Gitter of Spin said, \"driven by a monolithic drum machine that hammers with such force it could probably shift the tectonic plates, Godflesh successfully lays claim to the title of the most gloriously uncomfortable noise on the face of the planet\", and Luca Collepiccolo of Blast! called the album an unmissable fusion of extreme metal and technology. Fact wrote in their 2012 \"The 100 Best Albums of the 1990s\" list, where Pure placed number 64, that \"[the album] is far from the sound of Broadrick and Green going soft: one listen to the rampaging drum machines of its title track on a proper stereo is unforgiving proof of that.\" In 2014, Neil Kulkarni of The Quietus called the album a \"stone-cold masterpiece.\" Later in 2015, Fact's Robin Jahdi placed Pure as the 18th best post-metal album of all time, writing \"Pure is what happened when they started experimenting: incredibly harsh worlds of discordant post-punk guitar settling like factory smoke over catchy drum machine breakbeats.\" Brandon Stosuy of Pitchfork called the album \"iconic\", and Jon Wiederhorn of Revolver said that it influenced \"bands ranging from Korn and Fear Factory to Isis and Converge\". Some critics viewed Pure as more consistent than Streetcleaner, with greater attention paid to its beats and grooves.\n\nAccolades\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nAll credits adapted from the album's liner notes\n\nJustin Broadrick – guitar, vocals, engineering, production, rhythm programming\nG.

    "title": "Photobacterium",
    "text": "Photobacterium is a genus of gram-negative, oxidase-positive and catalase-positive bacteria in the family Vibrionaceae. Members of the genus are bioluminescent, that is they have the ability to emit light.\nMany species, including Photobacterium leiognathi and Photobacterium phosphoreum, Photobacterium ganghwense, Photobacterium marinum live in symbiosis with marine organisms. S.I. Paul et al. (2021) isolated and identified multiple strains of Photobacterium from marine sponges of the Saint Martin's Island Area of the Bay of Bengal, Bangladesh.\nSpecies such as Photobacterium profundum are adapted for optimal growth in the deep cold seas making it both a psychrophile (an organism capable of growth and reproduction in cold temperatures) and a piezophile (an organism which thrives at high pressures).\n\nBiochemical characteristics of Photobacterium species\nColony, morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics of Photobacterium species are shown in the Table below.\n\nNote: + = Positive; – =Negative; V =Variable (+/–)\n\nTaxonomy\nThere are currently 16 species with numerous subspecies known within the genus Photobacterium.  The development of 16S RNA sequencing has led to many species being shifted into and out of this genus.   Photobacterium can be distinguished from other genera based on identifiable characteristics.\n\nIdentifying characteristics\nMorphological shapes are straight or plump rods\nCell wall structure is classified as gram-negative\nRequire sodium for growth\nContain 1-3 polar flagella\nAre luminescent\nIncapable of forming resistant endospores\nAre chemoorganotrophs\n\nEcology\nPhotobacterium are primarily marine organisms (hence the use of sodium for growth).  They may be free-living or found as colonies associated with certain species of fish.  These organisms do not contain any pigmentation and therefore will appear white or colorless.  When there is a high density of cells forming a colony, they will exhibit fluorescence.  However, the fluorescence is based on the accumulation of autoinducers which is proportional to cell density and therefore free-living photobacterium will not fluoresce.  Their association with fish may be: symbiotic growth within fish for the formation of light organs, as a neutral entity on the surface or within the intestines of fish, as decomposers of dead fish, or as an agent of disease.\n\nPathogenicity\nSome of the 15 known species of Photobacterium have evolved into pathogens of marine life.  Some of these diseases affect commercially important fish and can therefore indirectly impact human health through their consumption.  This genus has been shown to degrade the chitin of the Deep Sea Tanner Crab (Chionoecetes tanneri).  The species Photobacterium damselae are among the most virulent and are divided into two subspecies: piscicida and damsela. P. damselae subspecies piscicida is the causative agent of fish pasteurellosis.  Bacterial colonies grow on the infected fish's spleen and kidney, eventually leading to mortality.  This disease accounts for severe losses in some fish farming enterprises with some of the most susceptible fish including Yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), certain Seabreams (Sparus spp.), Striped bass (Morone saxatilis), and White perch (Morone americana).  This subspecies is not pathogenic for humans.\n\nPhotobacterium damselae subspecies damsela\nFish-virulent strains of this subspecies of P. damselae cause septicemia in species of fish such as;  damselfish (Family Pomacentridae), eels (Anguilla anguilla), sandbar/brown sharks (Carcharhinus plumbeus), Yellowtails (Seriola quinqueradiata), seabreams (Sparus spp.) and turbots (Scophthalmus spp.).  This subspecies has been shown to be pathogenic for humans as it has been isolated from human wounds and has been shown to cause primary septicimia in healthy humans.\n\nSymptoms of Photobacteria damselae subspecies damselae\nFish infected by the subspecies damselae initially experience a reduced appetite accompanied by lethargicness and ulcerative lesions along their flank and head regions. Their stomachs will distend and they will experience extensive hemorrhaging especially in their eyes, mouth, and musculature.  There will also be petechiation of the gills and liver along with the characteristic accumulation of mucus around the gills.  It has been noted that the infected fish will swim violently a few minutes before death occurs.\n\nTransmission/infection of Photobacterium damselae subspecies damsela\nEvidence of epizootic outbreaks gained from an increase in ulcers noted among the fish populations seem to correlate to warmer seasons, suggesting a seasonal distribution in the incidence of the disease, dependent upon the waters temperature and salinity along with a decreased resistance caused by physiological changes experienced by the host during sexual maturity.\nSeawater is the most likely mode of transmission of the virulent cells of the pathogen.  Once it comes into contact with the outer surface of the fish, it is able to adhere to skin and resist the bactericidal action of the skin mucus layer, thus suggesting that the skin is the site of entry into the host.  This bacterium could therefore represent a significant threat to aquacultured fish species, especially those living in crowded and stressed conditions, where the spread of the disease could  be accelerated through direct contact and thus pose a threat to humans.\n\nSee also\nVibrio fischeri\n\nReferences\nHilgarth, Maik et al. \"Photobacterium Carnosum Sp.

    "title": "Antonio Callaway",
    "text": "Antonio Callaway (born January 9, 1997) is an American former professional football wide receiver. He played college football for the Florida Gators and was selected by the Cleveland Browns in the fourth round of the 2018 NFL draft.\n\nEarly life\nCallaway attended Booker T. Washington High School in Miami, Florida.\n\nCollege career\nAs a wide receiver at the University of Florida, he made an immediate impact in his true freshman season. He was selected All-American as a return specialist by CBS Sports in 2015. The 2015 Gators got off to an unexpected 6–0 start after entering their first four games unranked in the AP Poll. Their fourth victory was a thrilling 28–27 come-from-behind victory over Tennessee as Will Grier completed a pass on 4th-and-14 to Callaway for a 63-yard touchdown, and Tennessee could not respond as they missed a 55-yard field goal attempt as time expired. Callaway finished the 2015 season as Florida's leading receiver with 35 catches for 678 yards and four touchdowns.\nIn January 2016, Callaway and quarterback Treon Harris were suspended from the team. Florida head coach Jim McElwain said the suspensions were related to \"schoolwork.\" It was later revealed that the suspensions were related to an accusation of sexual assault. A woman accused Callaway of sexual assault and Harris of attempted sexual assault in December 2015. The woman reported the alleged incident to Florida's student conduct and conflict resolution office, but did not report the incident to either Gainesville police or University of Florida police. The University of Florida suspended both players for violating the school's code of conduct policy. Both players remained suspended until June, when they returned to campus to take classes and work out at the school's facilities. Callaway was found not responsible of sexually assaulting the female student by an independent hearing officer in a Title IX hearing. The ruling was made by attorney Jake Schickel, a former track and field athlete at Florida who has donated money to Florida's football and basketball programs. Schickel cleared Callaway of three violations of Florida's student conduct code, which included endangering another's health or safety, sexual assault and sexual misconduct, and conduct causing physical injury. On December 7, 2017, while suspended, Callaway made the decision that he was going to enter the 2018 NFL draft.\n\nCollegiate statistics\nProfessional career\nCleveland Browns\n2018 season\nThe Cleveland Browns selected Callaway in the fourth round (105th overall) of the 2018 NFL Draft. The Cleveland Browns traded their fourth (114th overall) and sixth round picks (178th overall) to the New England Patriots and received the Patriots' fourth round pick (105th overall) in exchange in order to draft Callaway. Callaway was the 12th wide receiver drafted in 2018. On May 21, 2018, the Browns signed Callaway to a four-year, $3.17 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $717,853.\n\nCallaway began training camp competing against Jeff Janis, Ricardo Louis, and Rashard Higgins for the job as the fourth wide receiver on the Browns' depth chart. Callaway and Rashard Higgins became contenders for a starting wide receiver position after Corey Coleman was granted a trade request on August 5, 2018. Head coach Hue Jackson named Callaway the third wide receiver on the depth chart to start the regular season, behind Jarvis Landry and Josh Gordon.\nHe made his professional regular season debut in the Browns' season-opener against the Pittsburgh Steelers and returned a kick for an eight-yard gain during their 21–21 tie. On September 16, 2018, Callaway earned his first career start and replaced Josh Gordon due to a hamstring injury. He recorded three receptions for 81-yards and scored his first career touchdown during a 21–18 loss at the New Orleans Saints in Week 2. Callaway caught his first career touchdown reception on a 47-yard pass by Browns' quarterback Tyrod Taylor during the fourth quarter. The following day, head coach Hue Jackson named Callaway the starting wide receiver after the Browns traded Josh Gordon to the New England Patriots. In Week 8, Callaway made a season-high five receptions for 36-yards and caught a one-yard touchdown pass thrown by Baker Mayfield as the Browns lost 33–18 at the Steelers.\n\n2019 season\nOn August 9, 2019, Callaway was suspended for the first four games of the 2019 season for violating the NFL's substance abuse policy. He was reinstated from suspension on September 30, and was activated prior to Week 5. On November 14, the Browns waived Callaway after showing up late to meetings and practices. He was also facing a 10-game suspension at the time of his release. He lost his appeal on November 15, and was suspended for the final seven weeks of the 2019 regular season and the first three weeks of the 2020 regular season.\n\nTampa Bay Vipers\nCallaway was signed by the Tampa Bay Vipers of the XFL on January 16, 2020. He suffered a lower leg injury in practice on January 29, and was placed on injured reserve on January 30. He had his contract terminated when the league suspended operations on April 10, 2020.\n\nMiami Dolphins\nOn September 7, 2020, Callaway was signed to the practice squad of the Miami Dolphins, while still serving a three-game suspension. He was suspended an additional four games by the NFL on September 18. He was reinstated from suspension on November 2, and the team activated him back to the practice squad. He was elevated to the active roster on November 14 for the team's week 10 game against the Los Angeles Chargers, and reverted to the practice squad after the game. Callaway was promoted to the active roster on November 18, 2020. The Dolphins waived Callaway on December 21, 2020.\n\nKansas City Chiefs\nOn January 13, 2021, Callaway signed a reserve/futures contract with the Kansas City Chiefs. He was waived with an injury designation on August 17. After going unclaimed on waivers, he was put on the Chiefs' injured reserve. He was released on August 26 after reaching an injury settlement with the Chiefs.\n\nDallas Cowboys\nOn November 11, 2022, the Dallas Cowboys hosted Callaway for a workout. He was signed to the team’s practice squad four days later. He signed a reserve/future contract on January 25, 2023. He was released by Dallas on June 5, 2023, following his arrest.\n\nNFL career statistics\nLegal issues\nOn August 5, 2018, Callaway was issued a citation in Strongsville, Ohio for possession of marijuana and driving with a suspended license during a traffic stop at 3am. The drug charges were dropped, and Callaway paid $911 for the license violation.\nCallaway was arrested in Miami, Florida on June 4, 2023, for driving with a suspended license. His arrest led to his release from the Cowboys the next day.\n\nSee also\n2015 College Football All-America Team\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nFlorida Gators bio\nAntonio Callaway on Twitter",

    "text": "Barot House is a 2019 Indian Hindi-language psychological thriller film directed by Bugs Bhargava Krishna and written by Sanjeev K. Jha. It stars Amit Sadh and Manjari Fadnis in the lead roles. The story revolves around an upper middle-class Indian family caught in the whirlwind of murder and crime. The film was released through Zee5 on 7 August 2019 to generally positive response from the critics.\n\nPlot\nAmit Barot, the patriarch of the Barot House, lives in a serene neighbourhood in Daman with his family consisting of his wife, Bhavana, mother, and 4 children – a son and 3 daughters.\nOn Janmashtami, one of the daughters, Shreya, goes missing while playing hide and seek. The following day, her body is found in a graveyard. Amit's younger brother Ajay and their neighbour Anthony are suspected for the murder of Shreya. Soon after, the second daughter of the house also dies, and the police suspect Ajay.\nBoth Amit and Bhavana become emotionally drained and Amit starts suspecting his son Malhar for the deaths of his daughters after he apparently tried to drown his baby sister Sneha while playing, who was saved by Amit. Malhar even admits it when Amit violently questions him.\nOne day Anthony's son Roshan is murdered and Amit tries to hang Malhar to save everyone but he can't. The police question Amit about Roshan's murder and Amit says that Malhar is the murderer. Malhar also accepts it.\nMalhar then admits himself to the juvenile home. A psychologist questions him to find the fact and fails. He is reluctant to see his father too. They find scars on the boy's back, and when he asks to draw something, he draws pictures of his father murdering the girls with him watching from a distance. But he throws away those drawings and shows one in which he plays tabla. The psychologist finds the drawings in the dustbin after watching Malhar through CCTV and believes that his father is the killer and Malhar tried to save his father because he worships him.\nThe police question the family again and it is revealed that Amit as well as Anthony's wife Sophia suspect Bhavana and Anthony of having an affair and Amit always suspected Shreya and Shruti to be Anthony's daughters. The police arrest Amit and releases Malhar. Amit tries to attack the boy, and because of this the police thinks he carried out the killings. Amit's wife also does not believe him.\nAfter a few days, while Bhavana is upstairs, Malhar throws little Sneha into the well which Bhavana witnesses from upstairs and screams. In the epilogue, Amit is released from jail and Malhar arrested again. Amit and Bhavana adopt 3 daughters and name them Shreya, Shruti and Sneha. They move out of Barot house and never see Malhar again. It is assumed that Malhar has schizophrenia, and he was very cunning for his age to lead the psychologists to believe in his innocence, without uttering a word. He even knew that he was being watched through CCTV. Malhar never explained the reason behind the brutal murders.\n\nCast\nAmit Sadh as Amit Barot\nManjari Fadnis as Bhavana Barot\nAaryan Menghji as Malhar Barot\nAseem Hattangadi as Anthony D'Souza\nFarida Patel Venkat as Pramila Patel\nKiearra Soni as Shreya Barot\nKishaa Arora as Shruti Barot\nAlefia Kapadia as Sophia D'Souza\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nBarot House at IMDb",

    "text": "Simon Conway is a London-born radio show host and public speaker who hosts a talk show on WHO-AM in Des Moines, Iowa.\n\nEarly life\nConway was born in London, England and raised in nearby Wellesden. There he got the journalism bug at a young age:\n\nWell, it was a winter's day in London. I was nine and a pupil at Hillel House. It was time for our English lesson with David Sassoon and he decided we should use glue, poster board and our imaginations to make a newspaper. My life would never be the same. On that day I decided I was going to be a journalist and I never let go of that goal.\nMoving to Israel as a teenager, Conway began his professional career as a 16-year-old journalist at The Jerusalem Post (in 1976). From the age of 18, back in the U.K., he was \"doing shifts\" on the Sunday Mirror and News of the World. He went undercover to investigative \"the awful Children of God sect\" and \"stuff for Panorama on the National Front\" back.\n\nCareer\nIn the U.K. Conway was \"doing almost daily hits\" on BBC Radio 4 or Radio 5 Live. He had international media in his studio on a regular basis, while being \"constantly interviewed\" by U.S. media—with \"multiple appearances\" on C-Span, CNN, and Fox News. He ran a successful corporate communications company in the U.K.\nHe moved to Orlando, Florida, in 2001, entering the real estate business, which Conway discovered was highly competitive. “There are thousands of people selling real estate in Orlando, literally,” he said, which led Conway \"to distinguish himself by buying time on the radio.\" When he got himself a one-hour weekend show he \"fell in love with the medium.\" “From the very first moment I was on the air, I did not talk about real estate,” Conway recalls. “It was like an epiphany. I had come home.”\nConway \"fell into a career as a fill-in talk show host,\" travelling across the U.S. working at “major, major stations”.\n\nWHO-AM\nIn 2011, Conway took a radio show hosting position at WHO-AM in Des Moines, Iowa, replacing Steve Deace who left for a nationally-syndicated show — and adding his name to the station's \"storied roster of hosts\", including former president Ronald Reagan who \"made a name for himself\" as a WHO sportscaster in the 1930s. On taking the job, Conway says, “If you're serious about talk radio, this isn't a job you turn down.”\n\nIowa caucuses\n\"It's a big country and the parties pick their candidates by asking the people in a series of primary elections or as in the case of Iowa, Caucuses. And Iowa is first in the nation to vote which can give a candidate the kind of momentum it takes to become President,\" Conway emphasizes.\nAbout 65,000 people across Iowa tune in to WHO-AM during the afternoon drive time, the largest in Iowa for talk radio. And the audience skews toward the politically-attuned, conservative type that Republican candidates want to attract.\n\nStyle\nConsidered \"the voice of Midwest conservatism,\" Conway reminds one journalist of \"a bulldog when he interviews politicians.\" His training in Britain formed his aggressive approach on the air, he said. “I am an equal-opportunity hater. I treat people the same whether I agree with them or [they] don't agree with me. I will always challenge their positions.\" He adds, “There are [as many] Republicans who don't want to face those questions as there are Democrats. The likes of [Ohio governor] John Kasich haven't been in my studio because he knows it isn't going to end well.”\n\"Most important of all for me – no script,\" Conway admits. \"I am very much a stream of consciousness person and that's why we deliver what we hope is compelling radio every single day.\" He arranges regular, unscientific online audience polls meant for entertainment on his show.\n\nControversy\nConway goaded Ron Paul in 2011 into admitting his noninterventionist foreign policy would have prevented him from executing the raid that killed Osama bin Laden.\nWhen The Des Moines Register published an interactive map allowing readers to identify schools that did not have security guards in 2013, Conway declared that they had provided \"a shopping list for every nut job in Iowa.\"\nConway has been an opponent of camera-generating traffic tickets stating in 2014: “The cameras are about money and only money. Cameras have absolutely nothing to do with safety, and the devices actually cause wrecks. If yellow-light times were increased by one second, wrecks at those intersections can be reduced by 50 percent.”\nFollowing Iowa's move to increase the gas tax by 10 cents a gallon in 2015, Conway urged his listeners to re-register as independents and \"ditch the GOP\".\nIn 2017, Conway interviewed CEO of MidAmerican Energy, Bill Fehrman, who admitted on air that 100% of the cost of wind turbines comes from taxes — used to fund related tax credits — confirming that industrial wind and solar are not economic.\nAfter questions arose surrounding the 2020 presidential election results, Conway stated: “It seems we are destined to go through this now, however, where our country is split in half. And four years ago, about half the country said, ‘We don't trust these results.’ And now, we’ve got about half the country saying, ‘We don't trust these results.’ It's really dangerous for the republic, right?”\nIn 2020 Conway stated live on air that vaccinations cause autism in children, while interviewing a childhood pediatrician.\nConway claimed numerous times in 2021 that facemasks do not work, despite providing no credible sources. He also conflates masking children in school with \"child abuse\".\nAfter the conviction of the Mollie Tibbets killer, Conway reaffirmed his beliefs on deportation and removal of illegal immigrants, despite (and stating this on his show) the wishes of Tibbets parents to not make her death about race or citizenship.\n\nStations\n1040 WHO/Des Moines (4pm-7pm) CDT\n1420 WOC/Quad Cities (4pm-6pm) CDT\n600 WMT/Cedar Rapids (4pm-6pm) CDT\n540 WFLA/Orlando\nNews Radio 1140 WRVA/Richmond\nTalk Radio 105-5 WERC/Birmingham\nNews Radio 630 WLAP/Lexington\nKOGO/San Diego (fill-in)\nWOAI/San Antonio (fill-in)\nKTLK/Minneapolis (fill-in)\n\nCharity\nConway serves as a Trustee on the Board of Directors for the USS Iowa (BB-61). He has led regular tours to southern California to visit the retired ship, now opened as a museum. He annually sponsors a \"BBQ sandwich giveaway\" for the benefit of the Puppy Jake Foundation, which trains service dogs to be placed with \"wounded warriors\". Raising $4,000 in its first year, the event raised over $35,500 five years later in 2018. Generally a local supermarket donates the meat, more than 200 pounds of it, and a local barbecue grilling champion donates buns and sauce and does the cooking.\n\nPersonal\nConway is Jewish and moved to Israel when he was 16. He has two daughters. He is a \"very proud naturalized American citizen.\" For five years he coached both men's and women's high school tennis in Orlando, Florida.\nAfter suffering two heart attacks during one week in 2017, Conway quit smoking and returned to the broadcast booth. Joel McCrea, general manager at WHO-AM, told the Des Moines Register the heart attacks were mild in nature.\nIn 2008 Conway received American citizenship. He has said of his homeland, \"I miss the curry. Friends. And the ability to go watch Chelsea play.\"\n\nReferences\nExternal links\niHeart Radio: WHO-AM Simon Conway\nSimon Conway at IMDb\nAppearances on C-SPAN\nBruce Merrin's Celebrity Speakers Simon Conway",

    "text": "New Grounds Print Workshop, founded in 1996 by Regina Held, is a nontoxic printmaking facility specializing in intaglio and relief printmaking. It is located in Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States. According to the mission statement on their website, New Grounds is \"dedicated to providing artists with a professional, informative, safer and well-equipped environment for the creation of fine prints while promoting the artists and exhibiting their work.\"\n\nOrigins and goals\nNew Grounds was founded in response to three particular needs: \n\nThe need for a printmaking center in Albuquerque offering classes, press and studio access to all artists working in intaglio and relief printmaking.\nThe need to educate the general public about printmaking by offering studio tours, lectures and exhibitions.\nThe need for this facility to be nontoxic.  At that time all printmaking constituted a high health risk to artists in addition to having a negative impact on the environment.\nA good definition of nontoxic, or green printmaking, can be found on Friedhard Kiekeben's website, NontoxicPrint.com: \"the term nontoxic/non-toxic has become synonymous with safety-conscious practice. Nontoxic processes still use a variety of chemicals, and the ultimate safety of any material and process is dependent on their informed use.\"\nNew Grounds utilized the research of the innovators Keith Howard and Mark Zaffron to build a completely green studio, and, according to a research paper written by Liz Chalfin from Zea Mays Printmaking studio, New Grounds was one of the first nontoxic printmaking studios in the United States.\n\nIt all began with a non-toxic studio in her remodeled South Valley garage, where artists would rent press access on an hourly basis and Held taught classes. At that time, New Grounds also offered papermaking classes and access to the papermaking studio. In 2000, Regina expanded to the current 3500 square foot commercial space in Nob Hill. Now, more than five years later, New Grounds includes a thriving gallery that represents member and international artists whose works Regina consigns. It is also a shared workspace where resident artists have the use of two large print rooms, five presses, comfortable work and storage areas, a break room, and areas in which to shoot photographic plates for gravures and to etch plates for intaglio prints. Another entire room, with its own press, is devoted to classes, where everything from monotype to the alternative process, gumoil printing, is taught.\n\nImpact\nNew Grounds Print Workshop has had a significant influence on the promotion of nontoxic printmaking. Other workshops have modeled their facilities after New Grounds and printmakers from school teachers to university professors from around the world have studied nontoxic printmaking there.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website",

    "text": "Albert-Xavier-Émile Mathiez (French pronunciation: [albɛʁ ɡzavje emil matje]; 10 January 1874 – 26 February 1932) was a French historian, best known for his Marxist interpretation of the French Revolution. Mathiez emphasized class conflict. He argued that 1789 pitted the bourgeoisie against the aristocracy and then the Revolution pitted the bourgeoisie against the sans-culottes, who were a proletariat-in-the-making. Mathiez greatly influenced Georges Lefebvre and Albert Soboul in forming what came to be known as the orthodox Marxist interpretation of the Revolution. Mathiez admired Maximilien Robespierre, praised the Reign of Terror and did not extend complete sympathy to the struggle of the proletariat.\n\nCareer\nMathiez came from a peasant family in Eastern France, being born in La Bruyère, Haute-Saône. He showed high intelligence as a young student, with a strong interest in history. He entered the École Normale Supérieure in 1894, by which time he had already displayed a strong anti-clerical bias. After graduation, he passed the aggregation in history and after doing his military service entered the teaching profession. He taught at a variety of local lycèes until he completed his doctorate which he wrote under the direction of François Victor Alphonse Aulard, then the leading historian of the Revolution, who admired Georges Danton. Mathiez was greatly influenced by Jean Jaurès, who propounded a more radical economic and social interpretation. At first a good friend of Aulard, he broke with his mentor in 1907, founding his own society, the Société des études robespierristes, with its journal, the Annales révolutionnaires. He also moved up from the lycée to the university level, teaching at Besançon and Dijon.\nEarlier a pacifist, Mathiez developed into a nationalistic Jacobin after the World War I erupted in 1914. He used his scholarship on the Revolution to demonstrate that just as Revolutionary France had defeated the allied coalition in the 1790s, so too the Third Republic would triumph over Imperial Germany. With its serious economic and social stresses such as shortages of food and rationing, the war prompted him to study similar conditions during the Revolution. The eventual result was one of his most original works, La Vie chère et le movement social sous la Terreur (1927).\nIn his masterwork La Révolution française (3 vol. 1922–1924), Mathiez boldly made Maximilien Robespierre the hero. Émile Durkheim's work in the sociology of religion influenced his interpretation of the 1790s.\nMathiez saw the French Revolution as the critical first stage in a proletarian advance that would gather strength in the revolutions of 1848, the Paris Commune of 1871 and the Russian revolts of 1905 and reached its highest point during the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution in Russia which created a dictatorship in the name of the proletariat.\nMathiez rejected the common view of Robespierre as demagogic, dictatorial and fanatical. Mathiez argued he was an eloquent spokesman for the poor and oppressed, an enemy of royalist intrigues, a vigilant adversary of dishonest and corrupt politicians, a guardian of the French Republic, an intrepid leader of the French Revolutionary government and a prophet of a socially responsible state. \nMathiez held the highly prestigious Sorbonne chair in French Revolutionary Studies and was the founder of the Societe des Etudes Robespierristes which led to the creation in 1908 of the highly regarded journal Annales révolutionnaries that became Annales historiques de la Révolution française in 1924.\nMathiez was active in the French Communist Party from 1920 but resigned in 1922. He joined the Socialist Communist Union but left it shortly after, becoming closer to the SFIO and supporting the Cartel des Gauches. By 1930, he was attacked by Stalinist historians, who condemned Mathiez and his Jacobinism as adversaries of the proletarian revolution. He was a vigorous polemicist. In his own defense after 1930, he mounted a sharp critique of his detractors.\nOn February 26, 1932, he suffered a cerebral hemorrhage in the presence of his students, in the Michelet amphitheater of the Sorbonne; quickly hospitalized, he died in the evening without having regained consciousness.\nA commemorative plaque in his likeness is still to this day in the amphitheater of the Sorbonne.\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\nFriguglietti, James.

    "title": "SCNN1B",
    "text": "The SCNN1B gene encodes for the β subunit of the epithelial sodium channel ENaC in vertebrates. ENaC is assembled as a heterotrimer composed of three homologous subunits α, β, and γ or δ, β, and γ. The other ENAC subunits are encoded by SCNN1A, SCNN1G, and SCNN1D.\nENaC is expressed in epithelial cells and is different from the voltage-gated sodium channel that is involved in the generation of action potentials in neurons. The abbreviation for the genes encoding for voltage-gated sodium channel starts with three letters: SCN. In contrast to these sodium channels, ENaC is constitutively active and is not voltage-dependent. The second N in the abbreviation (SCNN1A) represents that these are NON-voltage-gated channels.\nIn most vertebrates, sodium ions are the major determinant of the osmolarity of the extracellular fluid. ENaC allows transfer of sodium ions across the epithelial cell membrane in so-called \"tight-epithelia\" that have low permeability. The flow of sodium ions across epithelia affects osmolarity of the extracellular fluid. Thus, ENaC plays a central role in the regulation of body fluid and electrolyte homeostasis and consequently affects blood pressure.\nAs ENaC is strongly inhibited by amiloride, it is also referred to as an \"amiloride-sensitive sodium channel\".\n\nHistory\nThe first cDNA encoding the beta subunit of ENaC was cloned and sequenced by Canessa et al. from rat mRNA. A year later, two independent groups reported the cDNA sequences of the beta- and gamma-subunits of the human ENaC.  The exon-intron organization of the human beta ENaC gene SCNN1B was determined by Saxena et al. by sequencing genomic DNA from three subjects from three different ethnic groups. This study also established that the exon-intron architecture of the three subunits of ENaC have remained highly conserved despite the divergence of their sequences.\n\nGene structure\nWhile the human gene SCNN1A is located in chromosome 12p, the human genes encoding SCNN1B and SCNN1G are located in juxtaposition in the short arm of chromosome 16 (16p12-p13). Sequencing of the human genomic DNA indicated that the SCNN1B gene has 13 exons separated by 12 introns. The positions of introns are conserved in all three human ENaC genes, SCNN1A, SCNN1B and SCNN1G. The positions of the introns are also highly conserved across vertebrates. See: Ensembl GeneTree.\nAnalysis of transcripts of the SCNN1B gene in human kidney and lung showed several alternative transcription and translation initiation sites. However, only one of these transcripts (ENST00000343070) is highly expressed and other transcripts appear at low amounts.\n\nTissue-specific expression\nThe three ENaC subunits encoded by SCNN1A, SCNN1B, and SCNN1G are commonly expressed in tight epithelia that have low water permeability. The major organs where ENaC is expressed include parts of the kidney tubular epithelia, the respiratory airway, the female reproductive tract, colon, salivary and sweat glands.\nENaC is also expressed in the tongue, where it has been shown to be essential for the perception of salt taste.\nThe expression of ENaC subunit genes is regulated mainly by the mineralocorticoid hormone aldosterone that is activated by the renin-angiotensin system.\n\nProtein structure\nThe primary structures of all four ENaC subunits show strong similarity. Thus, these four proteins represent a family of proteins that share a common ancestor. In global alignment (meaning alignments of sequences along their entire length and not just a partial segment), the human β subunit shares 34% identity with the γ subunit and 26 and 23% identity with the α and δ subunits.\nAll four ENaC subunit sequences have two hydrophobic stretches that form two transmembrane segments named as TM1 and TM2.\nIn the membrane-bound form, the TM segments are embedded in the membrane bilayer, the amino- and carboxy-terminal regions are located inside the cell, and the segment between the two TMs remains outside of the cell as the extracellular region of ENaC. This extracellular region includes about 70% of the residues of each subunit. Thus, in the membrane-bound form, the bulk of each subunit is located outside of the cell.\nThe structure of ENaC has not been yet determined. Yet, the structure of a homologous protein ASIC1 has been resolved. The chicken ASIC1 structure revealed that ASIC1 is assembled as a homotrimer of three identical subunits. The authors of the original study suggested that each ASIC1 subunit resembles a hand holding a ball. Hence distinct domains of ASIC1 have been referred to as palm, knuckle, finger, thumb, and β-ball.\nAlignment of ENaC subunit sequences with ASIC1 sequence reveals that TM1 and TM2 segments and palm domain are conserved, and the knuckle, finger and thumb domains have insertions in ENaC. Site-directed mutagenesis studies on ENaC subunits provide evidence that many basic features of the ASIC1 structural model apply to ENaC as well. Yet, ENaC is an obligate heterotrimer composed of three subunits as an αβγ or a βγδ trimer.\nIn the carboxy terminus of three ENaC subunits, (α, β and γ) there is a special conserved consensus sequence PPPXYXXL that is called the PY motif. This sequence is recognized by the so-called WW domains in a special E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase named Nedd4-2.  Nedd4-2 ligates ubiquitin to the C-terminus of the ENaC subunit which marks the protein for degradation.\n\nAssociated diseases\nAt present, three major hereditary disorders are known to be associated with mutations in the SCNN1B gene. These are:\n1. Multisystem pseudohypoaldosteronism, 2. Liddle syndrome, and 3. Cystic fibrosis-like disease.\n\nMulti-system form of type I pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA1B)\nThe disease most commonly associated with mutations in SCNN1B is the multi-system form of type I pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA1B) that was first characterized by A. Hanukoglu as an autosomal recessive disease. This is a syndrome of unresponsiveness to aldosterone in patients that have high serum levels of aldosterone but suffer from symptoms of aldosterone deficiency with a high risk of mortality due to severe salt loss. Initially, this disease was thought to be  a result of a mutation in the  mineralocorticoid receptor (NR3C2) that binds aldosterone. But homozygosity mapping in 11 affected families revealed that the disease is associated with two loci on chromosome 12p13.1-pter and chromosome 16p12.2-13 that include the genes for SCNN1A and SCNN1B and SCNN1G respectively. Sequencing of the ENaC genes identified mutation in affected patients, and functional expression of the mutated cDNAs further confirmed that identified mutations lead to the loss of activity of ENaC.\nIn the majority of the patients with multi-system PHA1B a homozygous mutation or two compound heterozygous mutations have been detected.\n\nLiddle syndrome\nLiddle syndrome is generally caused by mutations in the PY motif or truncation of the C-terminus including loss of the PY motif in the β or γ ENaC subunits.  Even though there is a PY motif also in the α subunit, so far Liddle disease has not observed in association with a mutation in the α subunit. Liddle syndrome is inherited as an autosomal dominant disease with a phenotype that includes early onset hypertension, metabolic alkalosis and low levels of plasma renin activity and mineralocorticoid hormone aldosterone. In the absence of a recognizable PY motif, ubiquitin-protein ligase Nedd4-2 cannot bind to the ENaC subunit and hence cannot attach a ubiquitin to it. Consequently, proteolysis of ENaC by proteasome is inhibited and ENaC accumulates in the membrane leading to enhanced activity of ENaC that causes hypertension.\n\nInteractions\nSCNN1B has been shown to interact with WWP2 and NEDD4.\n\nNotes\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links\nSCNN1B+protein,+human at the U.S. National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)",

    "title": "Red-chested buttonquail",
    "text": "The red-chested buttonquail (Turnix pyrrhothorax) is a species of bird in the family Turnicidae.\nIt is endemic to Australia. The species is generally regarded as widespread, although uncommon, in New South Wales, Queensland, northern Western Australia and the Northern Territory, and classified as Vulnerable in Victoria.\nThe red-chested buttonquail is a small reddish-brown, ground-running bird, which avoids flying. The female is brighter and slightly larger in size and weight. The female is polyandrous, initiating courtship among several males and expelling rival females from her territory.\n\nTaxonomy\nThe red-chested buttonquail was originally described by ornithologist John Gould in 1841, Aberdeen, New South Wales, Australia. It was originally named Hemipodius pyrrhothorax. \nThe red-chested buttonquail belongs to the bird family Turnicidae, which resemble, but are unrelated to the Quail or Phasianidae. There are 17 species in the family Turnicidae, with two genera, Turnix and Ortyxelos. The red-chested buttonquail belongs to the genus Turnix. The red-chested buttonquail is usually regarded as monotypic, but recent proposal to treat T. worcesteri and T. everetti as subspecies of present species. Proposed subspecies berneyi (NW Australia) and intermedia (Queensland) are no longer recognized, because they are based on individual rather than geographical variation.\n\nDescription\nAdult red-chested buttonquails are 12–16 cm long with males weighing 27-46 g and females 31-83 g. The species is smaller in size than the painted button-quail. Viewed from behind, red-chested buttonquail look uniformly pale grey across the upper-wings and back. Side-on, the rufous wash on the upper-parts of the red-chested buttonquail is obvious. From close range its thick blue-grey beak, pink legs and feet, and pale eyes can be seen.\nFemales are brighter than males, with rufous of underparts brighter and extending over throat to sides of head, and narrower and denser barring on flanks that rarely extend onto breast as scalloping. Juveniles are smaller, darker above with white streaks and dark barring, bold white spots on wing-coverts, underparts white with rufous-brown gorget and upper breast scalloped.\nThe red-chested buttonquail is more commonly sighted in woodland habitats, than grassland habitats. When disturbed it scuttles through the grass or flies low with whirring wings often showing its white flanks before it drops to cover. The species generally prefers to stay close to the ground and avoids flying.\n\nSimilar species\nThe red-chested buttonquail is most easily distinguished by its uniformed grey-brown tone on its upper side and orange chestnut flakes. While the little buttonquail (Turnix velox) can be recognised by its distinctly reddish-brown or pinkish toned under-body and the contrasting tones between parts of its wings. The red-backed buttonquail (Turnix maculosus) has a darker slate-grey or blackish tone on its upper side and has dark underparts except for a contrasting wing panel.\n\nDistribution and habitat\nRed-chested buttonquails are found along the eastern side of Australia and the top of the Northern Territory and Western Australia. They are not found in Tasmania.\nThe species' preferred habitat is in dense grasslands, and open, grassy, woodland of Acacia (Fabaceae), river red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) and Black box (E. largiflorens) or Melaleuca (Myrtaceae), but also in crops and weedy fields with dense ground cover, and from coastal plains. They occur between sea level and 1000m above sea level. They are generally found in moister, denser vegetation cover than the little buttonquail, but also inhabit semi-arid zones. The common factors in their desired habitat seems to be bare ground and abundant leaf litter, little or no understorey, patches of tussock grass or sedges. The birds normally forage in open area of deep leaf litter, and retreat to the undercover of tussocks or woody debris if threatened.\n\nBehaviour\nFeeding\nThe red-chested buttonquail feeds on seeds (grasses, Triticum, Panicum and Malvaceae) and insects (cockroaches, ants, flies and larvae). Foraging occurs throughout the day, although the species has been said to be nocturnal and crepuscular. They make platelets while foraging, which is typical for the genus Turnix. They glean and scratch in leaf litter, while rotating on the spot by pivoting on one foot and raking with the other. Occasionally pecking at the ground, which can sometimes be detected in dry periods by the small puffs of dust they cause while making the platelets. They have been recorded feeding alone, in pairs or small groups of up to five.\n\nBreeding\nThe species breeds within tussock grasslands, spinifex or Melaleuca woodland, pastures of native grass, standing crops and stubble. The red-chested buttonquails are solitary breeders and females are sequentially polyandrous. The female usually constructs the nest and it is depression lined with grass, hooked, and shelter by grass tussock.\nEggs are laid in February–July/September in the north, and September–February in the south. Usually four white eggs with chestnut-brown markings are laid at one- or two-day intervals. Incubation lasts 13–18 days from completion of clutch. Males incubate and care for chicks alone. Chicks leave the nest precocial and nidifugous. They are grey-brown with dark and pale dorsal stripes. They reach adult size in 6–8 weeks and adult-like plumage at 2–3 months. They reach sexual maturity at 6 months.\n\nVocalization and communication\nThe female is known to display a repetitive advertising call of \"oom\" note, which increases in pitch and intensity. Disturbed birds utter a sharp chattering call. Adults are also known to communicate various soft whistles and chirrups. Juvenile birds have a weak, domestic, chicken-like call if handled.\n\nMigration\nRed-chested buttonquails are partial migrants. Red-chested buttonquails are known to have seasonal migration between inland arid regions to semi-arid areas nearer the coast, from winter to spring and summer. Some populations remain in one region all year round. The amount of movement is influenced by factors such as rainfall, plant growth and food availability.\n\nIn captivity\nIn captivity, if the enclosure is too small, the red-chested buttonquail is known to become aggressive. Males may fight each other's offspring, while females may kill offspring of other females, so that the male will re-mate.\n\nConservation status and threats\nThe red-chested buttonquail is classified as Least concern by the IUCN. It is not listed as threatened by the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, but its conservation status varies from state to state within Australia. It is listed as \"threatened\" by the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act (1988).  Under this Act, an Action Statement for the recovery and future management of this species has not yet been prepared. On the 2007 advisory list of threatened vertebrate fauna in Victoria, the red-chested buttonquail is listed as vulnerable.\nThe red-chested buttonquail is thought to be uncommon but secure throughout the rest of its Australian range. This species was formerly hunted for food and sport, and occasionally killed by feral pests for example cats and foxes. The major threat to this species is loss of suitable habitat. This species has not adapted to crop and farmland habitats to the extent of many other Buttonquail species. Red-chested buttonquail who nest in crops have been known to lose their clutches due to harvesting.\nThis species generally ranges from uncommon to locally common, with densities of 0·2–5 birds/ha reported. In the northern parts of its distribution range the species is frequent or at least widespread, but considered to be only sparsely distributed over much of Queensland, especially in coastal areas. In the southern parts of its distribution range the species is declining or suspected to be declining. The species is very uncommon in South Australia, infrequently recorded in New South Wales (where threatened in west of state) and very few records in Victoria. The species decline in Victoria is highly due to the conversion of native grasslands to agriculture, with 95% of such habitat having been destroyed or degraded in Victoria.\nGrazing by livestock, crop and pasture production, and the removal of woody debris for firewood, are threatening processes for the Red-chested buttonquail. Desired habitats of the Red-chested buttonquail such as ground covers, tussock grass, sedges and woody debris, should be managed to ensure suitable habitat conditions for this species remain.\n\n\n== References ==",

One night, upon hearing distant crying, Mary leaves her room to investigate and discovers her cousin, Colin. Colin is an invalid and bedridden, avoided by his father, demanding and hysterical and convinced that he will develop a hunchback like his father and die an early death. His presence was kept a secret from Mary by the housekeeper Medlock and the staff on his orders. With Mary's help, and intrigued by her stories of the moors, Dickon, and her eventual confession of finding the key to a hidden door into a neglected garden, he yearns to go outside and accompany Dickon and Mary in the garden as they seek to restore it back to life. Mary learns that the garden was beloved and tended by Colin's mother Lilias during her life. After a tragic fall caused her grave injuries, an early labour, and the birth of a sickly Colin, Lilias died. In Lord Craven's grief, he closed the garden away and hid the key, avoiding his son and sad memories of his wife's death. The passing years causes the garden to be almost forgotten, save for the old gardener Ben Weatherstaff, who -- keeping a promise to Lilias to maintain her garden years before -- enters the garden to prune the overgrowth. \nIn the process of restoring the bloom and verdure of the garden, Mary learns the value of love and care; Colin begins to believe in a healthy future for himself, and with the help of Mary and Dickon, gains the strength to walk. Colin's father Archibald, on receiving a letter from Mrs. Sowerby to return home, and experiencing a dream in which Lilias tells him to go to the garden, rushes back to the manor and finds Mary, Dickon, and his son Colin in the beautiful and blooming garden -- healthy, strong, and restored to health. Jubilant, they walk back to the manor together to the wonder and astonishment of the staff.\n\nCast\nSarah Hollis Andrews as Mary Lennox\nDavid Patterson as Colin Craven, Lord Craven's son and Mary's cousin\nAndrew Harrison as Dickon Sowerby, Martha's younger brother\nJacqueline Hoyle as Martha, Mrs. Medlock's servant and Dickon's older sister\nJohn Woodnutt as Mr. Archibald Craven\nHope Johnstone as Mrs. Medlock\nWilliam Marsh as John\nJennie Goossens as Nurse\nTom Harrison as Ben Weatherstaff, the gardener\nLorraine Peters as Mrs. Sowerby\nRichard Warner as Dr. Craven\n\nEpisode list\nTheme music\nThe soundtrack features a solo oboe playing \"The Watermill\" by Ronald Binge.\n\nReception\nThe drama was nominated for a British Academy Television Award in 1976 in the drama/entertainment category, and in 1979 it was nominated in the children's entertainment series category at the 1979 Daytime Emmy Awards.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nThe Secret Garden at IMDb\nThe Secret Garden at BBC Online \nThe Secret Garden at the BFI's Screenonline",

    "text": "Nelly Blair, later Nelly Smith (1759–1820) is sometimes suggested as being Scottish poet Robert Burns' first love.\n\nThe true identity of Nell\nBurns himself did not identify his 'Handsome Nell' by name. Nelly Kilpatrick has been suggested as being Burns's first romantic love, but some significant doubts exist about the true identity of this individual. It was thought to be a Nelly Blair until Burns's sister Isabella gave the name Nelly Kilpatrick, however Isobel was only three years old at the time of Burns's association with Nelly and some doubt must be cast on her recollections at this stage in her life.\n\nLife and character\nBurns stated that Nelly had a sweet voice and was wont to sing songs as she worked in the fields.\nThe first reference to Nelly's identity by the Reverend Hamilton Paul of Ayr in 1819 records that: \"This nymph was afterwards married to a Carrick farmer, and became the mother of many sons and daughters, and who, when we saw her in 1811, still retained the characteristics of sonsieness, which so fascinated her helpmate in the work of the harvest as to betray him into the sin of rhyme. She sung delightfully, and he wrote a copy of verses to her favourite air or reel.\"\nA parish record at Dreghorn records that a Helen Blair married a Carrick farmer, John Smith on 13 December 1788 and a daughter Helen was born at Dailly on 18 February 1789. Several other children were born in subsequent years.\nIn 1828 an anonymous letter to The Scotsman related that a friend of the writer had been a significant landowner in Ayrshire and that Robert Burns had been a frequent visitor to his kitchen and had written many songs about Nelly Blair, a servant in the house.\n\nAssociation with Robert Burns\nWhen Robert Burns was 15 he met \"Handsome Nell\", his first young love, a \"bonnie, sweet, sonsie lass\", although he apparently never told her of his love. Nelly Bone, is better known as Nelly Kilpatrick. They are first recorded to have met when William Burns hired some extra help to bring in the harvest while they were at nearby Mount Oliphant Farm and Burns came to be paired with her, following the Ayrshire custom of that time.\nIn his autobiographical letter to Dr Hunter he wrote: \"Indeed, I did not not well know myself I liked so much to loiter behind with her when returning in the evening from our labours; why the tones of her voice made my heart-strings thrill like an Aeolian harp, and particularly why my pulse beat such a furious rantann when I looked and fingered over her hand to pick out the nettle-stings and thistles\".\nHe wrote a poem to Nell, unpublished during his life, but it appeared in his Commonplace Book and set to the tune of Nelly's favourite reel.\nHe had heard her singing a song by a local country laird's son who was courting her and felt that he could do better, so it was with Nelly in mind that he wrote his first song \"Handsome Nell\" –\n\nThe tune to the song has not come down to us. Some years later Burns wrote of this song, saying –\n\"I never had the least thought or inclination of turning poet till I got once heartily in love, and then rhyme and song were, in a manner, the spontaneous language of my heart. I remember I composed it in a wild enthusiasm of passion, and to this hour I never recollect it but my heart melts, and my blood sallies at the remembrance.\"\nNelly has been said to figure in Burns's poem, \"Halloween\"\n\nand the verse :\n\nSee also\nReferences\nNotes\n\nSources",

    "text": "The Loser Plateau (also referred-to as the Loser-AugstEck plateau) is part of the Totes Gebirge mountain range in the Salzkammergut of Austria.  It is most easily accessed up a toll road from the town of Altaussee.  It is a Nature Reserve, notable for its caves and unspoilt alpine Karst ecosystem. Hunting permits are issued to control Chamois.\nThe central plateau area is relatively flat, at an altitude of 1500-1600m, rising gently to the north and east, and covering about 4 km2. The whole massif is approximately 12 km2. The area drops steeply on all sides, and is bounded to the SE by path 234 from the Wildenseehutte down to Altausseer See, to the south by the lake itself, then to the SW by the road to Blaa-Alm. The Western edge is marked by the valley of Grüne Bichl, and the northern limit is the ridge crest of Schönberg, then a rather ill-defined line back to the Wildenseehütte. Recently its southern (Loser) face has been heavily developed for skiing.\nAccess to the area is relatively easy at its southern edge, due to the Loser Panoramastraße toll road. This climbs the southern slopes of Loser to reach a large parking area and self-service restaurant at 1600m just below Augst See. From here, good paths reach both the southern slopes of Vd. Schwarzmooskogel, and also north to a col overlooking the extensive pathless central plateau. Both the further reaches of the central plateau and the areas around the Schönberg, Gries Kogel and Augst-Eck ridges are remote - being large pathless areas of rough karren with little or no water supplies except for snowmelt.\nThe plateau is full of caves - with over 230 catalogued so far in the area 1623 in the Austrian cave Kataster.\nSeveral caving clubs, including Cambridge University Caving Club and ARGE Grabenstetten, discover and explore the caves on the Plateau.  Notable discoveries include: Steinbrückenhöhle, Kaninchenhöhle, Stellerweghöhle, Schwarzmooskogeleishöhle, and Raucherkarhöhle (19th longest cave in the world).\nA painting by Anthony van Dyck belonging to the Rothschild family was hidden in a salt mine near the Loser Plateau during the German occupation until 1945.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nLoser Webpage",

    "title": "Spillway",
    "text": "A spillway is a structure used to provide the controlled release of water from a dam or levee, typically downstream into the dammed river. In the United Kingdom, it may be known as an overflow channel. A spillway ensures that water does not damage parts of the structure not designed to convey water.\nSpillways can include floodgates and fuse plugs to regulate water flow and reservoir level. Such features enable a spillway to regulate downstream flow, allowing dam operators to release water in a controlled manner before the reservoir is full, thereby preventing an unacceptably large release later.\nOther uses of the term \"spillway\" include bypasses of dams and outlets of channels used during high water, and outlet channels carved through natural dams such as moraines.\nWater normally flows over a spillway only during flood periods, when the reservoir has reached its capacity and water continues entering faster than it can be released through penstocks or intake towers used to control water release on a routine basis for purposes such as water supply for irrigation and hydroelectricity generation.\n\nTypes\nA spillway is located near the top of the reservoir pool.  Dams may also have bottom outlets with valves or gates which may be operated to release flood flow, and a few dams lack overflow spillways and rely entirely on bottom outlets.\n\nThe two main types of spillways are controlled and uncontrolled.\nA controlled spillway has mechanical structures or gates to regulate the rate of flow. This design allows nearly the full height of the dam to be used for water storage year-round, and flood waters can be released as required by opening one or more gates.\nAn uncontrolled spillway, in contrast, does not have gates; when the water rises above the lip or crest of the spillway, it begins to be released from the reservoir. The rate of discharge is controlled only by the height of water above the reservoir's spillway. The fraction of storage volume in the reservoir above the spillway crest can only be used for the temporary storage of floodwater; it cannot be used as water supply storage because it sits higher than the dam can retain it.\nIn an intermediate type, normal level regulation of the reservoir is controlled by the mechanical gates.  In this case, the dam is not designed to function with water flowing over the top if it, either due to the materials used for its construction or conditions directly downstream. If inflow to the reservoir exceeds the gate's capacity, an artificial channel called an auxiliary or emergency spillway will convey water.  Often, that is intentionally blocked by a fuse plug.  If present, the fuse plug is designed to wash out in case of a large flood greater than the discharge capacity of the spillway gates. Although  many months may be needed for construction crews to restore the fuse plug and channel after such an operation, the total damage and cost to repair is less than if the main water-retaining structures had been overtopped. The fuse plug concept is used where  building a spillway with the required capacity would be costly.\n\nOpen channel spillway\nChute spillway\nA chute spillway is a common and basic design that transfers excess water from behind the dam down a smooth decline into the river below. These are usually designed following an ogee curve. Most often, they are lined on the bottom and sides with concrete to protect the dam and topography. They may have a controlling device and some are thinner and multiply-lined if space and funding are tight. In addition, they are not always intended to dissipate energy like stepped spillways.  Chute spillways can be ingrained with a baffle of concrete blocks but usually have a \"flip lip\" and/or dissipator basin, which creates a hydraulic jump, protecting the toe of the dam from erosion.\n\nStepped spillway\nStepped channels and spillways have been used for over 3,000 years. Despite being superseded by more modern engineering techniques such as hydraulic jumps in the mid twentieth century, since around 1985 interest in stepped spillways and chutes has been renewed, partly due to the use of new construction materials (e.g. roller-compacted concrete, gabions) and design techniques (e.g. embankment overtopping protection). The steps produce considerable energy dissipation along the chute and reduce the size of the required downstream energy dissipation basin.\nResearch is still active on the topic, with newer developments on embankment dam overflow protection systems, converging spillways and small-weir design.\n\nBell-mouth spillway\nA bell-mouth spillway is designed like an inverted bell, where water can enter around the entire perimeter. These uncontrolled spillways are also called morning glory (after the flower), glory hole, or shaft spillways. In areas where the surface of the reservoir may freeze, this type of spillway is normally fitted with ice-breaking arrangements to prevent the spillway from becoming ice-bound.\nSome bell-mouth spillways are gate-controlled. The highest morning glory spillway in the world is at Hungry Horse Dam in Montana, U.S., and is controlled by a 64-by-12-foot (19.5 by 3.7 m) ring gate. The largest bell-mouth spillway is in Geehi Dam, in New South Wales, Australia, measuring 105 ft (32 m) in diameter at the lake's surface.\n\nSiphon spillway\nA siphon spillway uses the difference in height between the intake and the outlet to create the pressure difference required to remove excess water. Siphons require priming to remove air in the bend for them to function, and most siphon spillways are designed to use water to automatically prime the siphon. One such design is the volute siphon, which employs volutes, or fins, on a funnel to form water into a vortex that draws air out of the system. The priming happens automatically when the water level rises above the inlets.\n\nOther types\nThe ogee crest over-tops a dam, a side channel wraps around the topography of a dam, and a labyrinth uses a zig-zag design to increase the sill length for a thinner design and increased discharge. A drop inlet resembles an intake for a hydroelectric power plant and transfers water from behind the dam directly through tunnels to the river downstream.\n\nDesign considerations\nOne parameter of spillway design is the largest flood it is designed to handle. The structures must safely withstand the appropriate spillway design flood (SDF), sometimes called the inflow design flood (IDF). The magnitude of the SDF may be set by dam safety guidelines, based on the size of the structure and the potential loss of human life or property downstream.  The magnitude of the flood is sometimes expressed as a return period. A 100-year recurrence interval is the flood magnitude expected to be exceeded on the average of once in 100 years. This parameter may be expressed as an exceedance frequency with a 1% chance of being exceeded in any given year. The volume of water expected during the design flood is obtained by hydrologic calculations of the upstream watershed. The return period is set by dam safety guidelines, based on the size of the structure and the potential loss of human life or property downstream. \nThe United States Army Corps of Engineers bases their requirements on the probable maximum flood (PMF) and the probable maximum precipitation (PMP). The PMP is the largest precipitation thought to be physically possible in the upstream watershed. Dams of lower hazard may be allowed to have an IDF less than the PMF.\n\nEnergy dissipation\nAs water passes over a spillway and down the chute, potential energy converts into increasing kinetic energy. Failure to dissipate the water's energy can lead to scouring and erosion at the dam's toe (base). This can cause spillway damage and undermine the dam's stability. To put this energy in perspective, the spillways at Tarbela Dam could, at full capacity, produce 40,000 MW; about 10 times the capacity of its power plant.\nThe energy can be dissipated by addressing one or more parts of a spillway's design. \n\nSteps\nFirst, on the spillway surface itself by a series of steps along the spillway (see stepped spillway).\nFlip bucket\nSecond, at the base of a spillway, a flip bucket can create a hydraulic jump and deflect water upwards.\nSki jump\nA ski jump can direct water horizontally and eventually down into a plunge pool, or two ski jumps can direct their water discharges to collide with one another.\nStilling basin\nThird, a stilling basin at the terminus of a spillway serves to further dissipate energy and prevent erosion. They are usually filled with a relatively shallow depth of water and sometimes lined with concrete. A number of velocity-reducing components can be incorporated into their design to include chute blocks, baffle blocks, wing walls, surface boils, or end sills.\n\nSafety\nSpillway gates may operate suddenly without warning, under remote control. Trespassers within the spillway are at high risk of drowning. Spillways are usually fenced and equipped with locked gates to prevent casual trespassing within the structure. Warning signs, sirens, and other measures may be in place to warn users of the downstream area of sudden release of water. Operating protocols may require \"cracking\" a gate to release a small amount of water to warn persons downstream.\nThe sudden closure of a spillway gate can result in the stranding of fish, and this is usually avoided.\n\nGallery\nSee also\nDam safety system\nReservoir\nStepped spillway\nFish ladder\nTailrace fishing\nToddbrook Reservoir\nOroville Dam crisis\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nChris, Fish. \"The Glory Hole\".

    "text": "Rheda-Wiedenbrück (German pronunciation: [ˈʁeːda viːdn̩ˈbʁʏk] ; Westphalian: Raie-Wienbrügge) is a city in the district of Gütersloh, in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.\n\nGeography\nThe twin community lies within the valley of the river Ems in the Westphalian Lowland south of the Teutoburg Forest, which is about 30 km away. The formerly independent towns of Rheda and Wiedenbrück are separated by the Federal Highway 2 which does not, however, form the historic border between the two districts. The Ems river runs through the city. The nearest major cities are Gütersloh (about 11 km), Bielefeld and Paderborn around 35 km away, and Hamm about 55 km away.\nThe river enters from the southeast into an urban area. Close to the public pool in Wiedenbrück, an artificial side arm branches off to the north of the river Ems. The Ems and the artificial branch are flowing around the old historic Wiedenbrück city centre and come together again behind the Ems lake at the height of the Wiedenbrück High School. The river then flows through the grounds of the State Garden Show 1988, connects the Wiedenbrücker center with the center of Rheda and leaves the urban area in the northernmost tip. Several small tributaries of the Ems are located in the municipality. Other notable waters are the Buxelssee northeast of the motorway, the Bänischsee northeast of Rheda and Lintel lake east of Wiedenbrück. One characteristic of the two combined cities is a green strip several kilometers long along the Ems, starting at Emssee in downtown Wiedenbrück and ending near the water castle in Rheda. The overall flat terrain falls from south to north. Outside the settlement areas, the city is dominated by agriculture and the city has comparatively large forest areas surrounding the city.\n\nExpanse and utilisation of city area\nThe city, which is classified as a small center city municipality has an area of 86.68 km². The majority consists of agricultural and forest area, a combined 72%. The greatest distance from north to south is 12.6 km, from east to west about 14 km.\n\nThe length of the city border is 50,2 km, the highest elevation at 105m and the lowest point at 66m above mean sea level.\n\nNeighbouring municipalities\nOelde\nHerzebrock-Clarholz\nGütersloh\nRietberg\nLangenberg\n\nDivision and organisation\nRheda-Wiedenbrück is divided according to § 3 of the main articles of association in the city itself and the three villages Batenhorst, Lintel and St. Vit. Before 1 October 2004 the neighbourhood Nordrheda-Ems also was classified as a village, but was then merged with Rheda. The following table shows the numbers of inhabitants and areas of the towns and city areas as of 1 January 2013.\n\nHistory\nIt is suspected that in 785 a first small church was built in Wiedenbrück. Excavations show the emergence of a transept basilica built after 900. The dendrochronological analysis of two tree coffins found north of the Saint Aegidius church resulted in a dating to the years 907/923 and 926/42. Rheda was documented at the latest in 1088 and earliest in 1085. Since its first mentioning in 1170 until 1807/1815, the castle or the later Rheda Castle was the center of the Rheda ruling region (the County of Bentheim-Tecklenburg-Rheda).\nWiedenbrück was the seat of the Office Reckenberg and thus an exclave of the Bishopric of Osnabrück.\nEmperor Otto granted the rights of market, coin and customs law for Wiedenbrück to the bishop of Osnabrück in the year 952. Several certificates issued by Otto III (HRE) in Wiedenbrück in 985 are known. It is therefore assumed that a royal court existed in Wiedenbrück at that time.\nIn 1225 bishop Engelbert of Osnabrück took over the ancient legal court responsibility for Wiedenbrück and other cities. This is one of the starting points of the development of the Bishopric of Osnabrück to a territorial state of the Bishop of Osnabrück. The oldest surviving coins from Wiedenbrück are dated 1230. In 1231 Wiedenbrück was proclaimed civitas. Aldermen were elected to the Court and a seal was announced. In 1249 the new town was founded and a year later castle Reckenberg was mentioned for the first time.\nAround 1462 a first constitution was drafted, based on the constitution of Osnabrück. In 1543 Wiedenbrück was reformed by Hermann Bonnus, a representative of the Bishop Franz of Waldeck. By 1565 Wiedenbrück was predominantly Lutheran. In the same year the boundaries between the Office Reckenberg to which Wiedenbrück counted, and the adjacent Rheda were established in the so-called Bielefeld recess, as two independent sovereign areas were first recognized.\nAfter first steps for a Counter-Reformation were taken in 1624/1625, Wiedenbrück was occupied in 1626 during the Thirty Years' War by the Danes . When the Bishop Franz Wilhelm von Wartenberg assumed office in 1628, he continued the Counter-Reformation.\nIn 1637 Wiedenbrück established one of the oldest high schools in the region, the Gymnasium Marianum, a Latin School and forerunner of the current Ratsgymnasium high school in Wiedenbrück. The Franciscan monastery was founded in 1644 by Bishop Franz Wilhelm. Three years later, in July 1647 Wiedenbrück was taken by the Swedes, but cleared after dismantling of the fortress within two months. When in 1648 in Münster and Osnabrück the Peace of Westphalia was negotiated, this did require the alternation of a Catholic and a Lutheran bishop in the House of Brunswick-Lüneburg for the Bishopric of Osnabrück.\nIn 1664, prompted by Ernst August I., the refortification of the city began. In 1716 the last urban copper coins were minted. In 1726, a new office building was constructed on the Reckenberg.\nAs a result of the conversion of bishopric Osnabrück into a principality, Wiedenbrück was attached to the house of Hanover in 1802. In 1807 the city became part of the Kingdom of Westphalia. The chapter of fellows of collegiate  was disbanded in 1810, and the Office Reckenberg with Wiedenbrück were ceded to Prussia at the Congress of Vienna in 1816 and assigned to the new province of Westphalia. Wiedenbrück thus separated from the Diocese of Osnabrück, the Catholic communities of the former Office Reckenberg came to the Archdiocese of Paderborn.\nIn the early morning hours of 10 November 1938 members of the SA, who had previously gathered in the adjacent restaurant Neuhaus, set the Rheda synagogue on fire. The remains were demolished and the property subsequently sold. In \n1938 the federal highway A2 was opened to traffic. The highway was not, as is sometimes falsely claimed built almost exactly on the border between Rheda Wiedenbrück, but crosses it several times in different city areas.\nIn 1940, Field Marshal Hermann Goering ordered the confiscation of all bronze church bells, which were to be used for arms manufacturing. From 1816 until the local government reform in 1970, the city was the seat of the district named after the city of Wiedenbrück.\n\nReligions\nOf the 47,723 inhabitants (as of 1 January 2013), a total of 23,428 or about 49.1% are of Roman Catholic faith. Rheda-Wiedenbrück belongs to the Archdiocese of Paderborn. 10,274 inhabitants, or about 21.6% are Protestant faith. These believers are part of the church district of Gütersloh in the Evangelical Church of Westphalia. The remaining 10,802 inhabitants or 23.6%, have a different creed or religious affiliation. Because the district of Gütersloh is a stronghold of the Assyrian people living in Germany, the city has a relatively high share of members of the Syriac Orthodox Church.\n\nPopulation history\nThe following overview shows the numbers of inhabitants of the city Rheda-Wiedenbrück and for 1939, 1950 and 1961 the number of inhabitants of the present-day city area. The figures up to 1970 and for 1987 are census results  and from 1975 based on official updates by the State Office for Data Processing and Statistics. The figures from 1975 to 1985 are estimated values, the figures from 1990 extrapolations based on the results of the census of 1987. The data refer to the resident population and from 1985 to the population with the main place of residence in the city.\n\nEconomy\nThe Tönnies Holding has its headquarters in Rheda-Wiedenbrück and operates the largest pork plant in Germany there.\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\nRheda-Wiedenbrück is twinned with:\n\n Adjengré, Togo\n Aouda, Togo\n Oldenzaal, Netherlands\n Palamós, Spain\n\nNotable people\nMartin Harlinghausen (1902–1986), general\nLiz Mohn (born 1941), businesswoman and philanthropist\nTim Krohn (born 1965), Swiss writer\nHanne Wolharn (born 1968), actress\nIngo Pohlmann (born 1972), pop musician\nNicole Kortlüke (born 1974), film editor\nTobias Böckers (born 1964), anatomist and neuroscientist\nMarkus Siegenhort, metal musician\nUlrich von Zons (born 1968), politician\n\nAssociated with the town\nLuise Hensel (1798–1876), poet, lived for more than 20 years in Wiedenbrück\nBernhard Hoetger (1874–1949), artist, lived in Wiedenbrück for a short time\nLuigi Colani  (1928–2019), designer, lived temporarily in Rheda\nJudith Lefeber (born 1981), singer, grew up in Rheda-Wiedenbrück\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website  (in German)",

    "text": "FK Rad (Serbian Cyrillic: ФК Рад) is a football club based in Banjica, Belgrade, Serbia. They compete in the Belgrade First League, the fifth tier of the national league system.\nFounded in 1958, the club spent a total of 30 seasons in the top flight between 1987 and 2021, including five seasons in the Yugoslav First League, 12 seasons in the First League of Serbia and Montenegro, and 13 seasons in the Serbian SuperLiga.\n\nHistory\nThe club was founded on 10 March 1958 by GP Rad, a local construction company. They acquired the league rights from FK Razvitak, a small club based in Banjica, going on to compete in the local leagues of Belgrade until the early 1970s. The club earned promotion to the Yugoslav Second League in 1973, spending the next 14 seasons in the second tier of Yugoslav football. They also reached the 1981–82 Yugoslav Cup quarter-finals, losing to Dinamo Zagreb.\nIn the 1986–87 Yugoslav Second League, the club became champions in Group East and took promotion to the Yugoslav First League for the first time in history. They placed 15th in their debut appearance in the top flight, just one point above the relegation zone. The club subsequently finished in fourth place in the 1988–89 season, earning a spot in the 1989–90 UEFA Cup. They were eliminated in the first round after losing 3–2 on aggregate to Olympiacos.\nFollowing the dissolution of SFR Yugoslavia, the club continued to compete at the highest national level, finishing fifth in the inaugural 1992–93 First League of FR Yugoslavia. They would also place in the top five in three consecutive seasons from 1998 to 2000. With the beginning of the new millennium, the club slowly started to decline and eventually suffered relegation in the 2002–03 season. They returned to the top flight of Serbia and Montenegro football in its final edition, but were promptly relegated.\nHaving spent two seasons in the Serbian First League, the club placed fourth in 2007–08 and managed to earn promotion to the Serbian SuperLiga via the play-offs. They tied their highest-ever fourth-place finish in 2010–11, which earned them qualification for the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League, to return to European football after 22 years. After spending 13 consecutive seasons in the top flight, the club suffered relegation in 2021. They would subsequently end bottom of the table in the 2022–23 Serbian First League, dropping to the third tier for the first time in 50 years.\nAfter suffering a second consecutive relegation in 2024, the club found itself in the Belgrade Zone League, the fourth tier of Serbian football. They were also banned from registering any new players during the 2024–25 season due to outstanding debts. As a result, the club was unable to prevent a third successive relegation, losing all of its games, except for two forfeited wins, and conceding 170 goals to drop to the Belgrade First League.\n\nHonours\nYugoslav Second League (Tier 2)\n\n1986–87 (Group East)\n\nSeasons\nEuropean record\nSupporters\nThe club's main supporters' group, known as United Force, was formed in 1987.

    "title": "Blair Brown",
    "text": "Bonnie Blair Brown (born April 23, 1946) is an American theater, film and television actress. She has had a number of high-profile roles, including in the play Copenhagen on Broadway (for which she won a Tony Award in 2000), the leading actress in the films Altered States (1980), Continental Divide (1981) and Strapless (1989), as well as a run as the title character in the comedy-drama television series The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd, which ran from 1987 to 1991 and earned her four consecutive Outstanding Comedy Series Actress Emmy Award nominations. Her later roles include Nina Sharp on the Fox television series Fringe and Judy King on the Netflix series Orange Is the New Black.\n\nEarly life and education\nBrown was born in Washington, D.C.  Her mother was a teacher and her father worked for the Central Intelligence Agency. She graduated from The Madeira School in McLean, Virginia, and then pursued acting at the National Theatre School of Canada, graduating in 1969. She gained notice as a participating actor at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival and spent several years working on the stage.\n\nCareer\nFilm\nBrown's first feature role was in the Oscar-winning 1973 film The Paper Chase. Her first major starring role was in The Choirboys in 1977. Among her other film credits are Altered States (opposite William Hurt), One Trick Pony (with Paul Simon), Stealing Home (opposite Mark Harmon), and A Flash of Green (1984). Her arguably highest profile film role to date was the romantic lead opposite John Belushi in Continental Divide (1981) for which she received her first Golden Globe Award nomination, in the category of Best Motion Picture Actress in a Comedy/Musical.\nOther film roles include: And I Alone Survived (1978), Strapless (1989), The Astronaut's Wife (1999), Clint Eastwood's Space Cowboys (2000), Lars von Trier's Dogville, the Kevin Bacon-directed Loverboy (2005) and  The Sentinel (2006).\n\nTelevision\nBrown appeared in several television movies and miniseries, primarily during the 1980s. A high-profile role as Jacqueline Kennedy in the 1983 TV miniseries Kennedy earned her a second Golden Globe nomination, for Best Actress in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television, as well as a BAFTA nomination. She also appeared in several other programs about the Kennedys, including the 1996 miniseries A Season in Purgatory, which was a thinly veiled portrait of the family, as well as an appearance as Anna Roosevelt in a telefilm about Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt.\nBrown's visibility rose during her five-year run (1987–1991) on the comedy-drama series The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd. She played the title role, and she, and the show, earned a small but dedicated following. Brown received five consecutive Emmy Award nominations for each season, in the category of Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, but never won. The show spent two years on NBC, then moved to the Lifetime cable channel for the remainder of its run. \nBrown also appeared in other prime-time series including The Rockford Files, Kojak, Frasier, Smallville, Touched by an Angel, ER, and Ed. In 1975 she appeared in one episode of the television mini-series Wheels and the following year she appeared in the TV pilot for The Oregon Trail. Beginning in 2008, Brown starred as Nina Sharp in the Fox television series Fringe. Brown also appeared in several seasons of the Netflix comedy-drama series Orange is the New Black as fictional television personality Judy King, an inmate loosely based on Martha Stewart.\n\nStage\nBrown has been involved with theater since the beginning of her career. She appeared in the 1975 New York Shakespeare Festival production of The Comedy of Errors. Among her earlier roles was a run as Lucy Brown in the 1976 production of The Threepenny Opera, produced by Joe Papp and directed by Richard Foreman. She left the production for film work, but after being away from the production for eight months, Ellen Greene, who was playing the part of Jenny, fell ill. Brown astounded the stage manager of the production by coming in and, with one hour of rehearsal, put on a \"brilliant\" performance as Jenny. Her first major appearance on Broadway came in 1989, in the play Secret Rapture, written by David Hare.\nOnce \"Molly Dodd\" concluded, Brown became a prolific Broadway actress, appearing in, among other productions, Tom Stoppard's 1995 Lincoln Center Theater production of Arcadia and two separate runs as Frau Schneider in the revival of Cabaret (1998 and 2003). She played Margrethe, the wife of physicist Niels Bohr, in the play Copenhagen, a role for which she won a 2000 Tony Award in the category of Best Featured Actress in a Play. Brown played the lead role in Sarah Ruhl's 2006 play The Clean House at Lincoln Center.\n\nVoice\nIn the 1990s, Brown expanded her career into voiceover work, narrating both audiobooks and films and documentaries. Her audiobooks projects include John Grisham's The Client, Lois Lowry's Number the Stars, Stephen King's Rose Madder, Kevin Henkes' Olive's Ocean, Sue Miller's 2005 novel Lost in the Forest, and Isabel Allende's Inés of My Soul.\nHer voiceovers are heard on a number of documentaries, including PBS's American Experience series and the 2007 PBS series The Mysterious Human Heart. Other documentary narrations include the French-American documentary L'Empreinte des dinosaures (titled Tracking Africa's Dinosaurs in English, broadcast in 2001 by France 3 and in 2002 by the Discovery Channel), the scientific series The Secret Life of the Brain, a documentary on Aimee Semple McPherson, which aired in April 2007, and a 2006 PBS documentary about Marie Antoinette. In April, 2010, she co-narrated the PBS special The Buddha with Richard Gere.\n\nPersonal life\nBrown had a relationship with actor Richard Jordan, whom she met while filming the miniseries Captains and the Kings in 1976. The couple lived together from 1976 to 1985; their son Robert Hand Jordan was born in 1983. She dated playwright David Hare from 1985 to 1990; he referred to her as his muse.\n\nActing credits\nFilms\nTelevision films\nTelevision series\nTheater\nAs actor\nAs director\nLovely Day, Beckett Theater (Off-Broadway), 2006\nA Feminine Ending, Playwrights Horizons (Off-Broadway), 2007\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nBlair Brown at IMDb\nBlair Brown at the Internet Broadway Database",

He was also briefly a Liberal Party politician.\n\nBackground\nGrant was born in Edinburgh, Scotland on 12 June 1872, the son of Sir Alexander Grant, 10th Baronet. He was educated at Fettes College, Edinburgh and Balliol College, Oxford. While at Oxford he won a Rugby football blue. In 1896 he married Mabel Bessie Lovett. The marriage produced two children. In 1910, Mabel died. In 1914, he married Margaret Lucia Cochran of Ashkirk, Selkirkshire. That marriage also produced two children. Following the death of his brother he succeeded to the title of 12th Baronet Grant of Dalvey on 11 February 1936.\n\nDiplomatic service\nIn 1895 Grant entered the Indian Civil Service. He was Deputy Commissioner of various Frontier districts and Secretary to Frontier Administration. In 1904 he accompanied the Dane Mission to Kabul. In 1908 he was awarded a Companion of the Indian Empire. In 1914 he was appointed Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, serving for 5 years. In 1915 he was awarded a Companion of the Star of India. In 1918 he was awarded a Knight Commander of the Indian Empire. In 1919, after the Third Anglo-Afghan War, he was the Chief Delegate at the Rawalpindi Conference which ended the British protectorate of Afghanistan. He served as the Chief Commissioner of the North-West Frontier Province of British India from 1919 until 1921. In 1922 he was awarded a Knight Commander of the Star of India.\n\nPolitical activity\nIn 1922 Grant left India and returned to Britain. He decided to pursue a political career and was chosen as Liberal candidate for Roxburgh and Selkirk where his wife was from. At the time, the Liberals were split between supporters of H. H. Asquith and supporters of Prime Minister David Lloyd George. Grant was a supporter of Asquith and the Roxburgh seat was held by a supporter of Lloyd George. At the general election held that year, the other parties left the seat for the two Liberal candidates and Grant was narrowly defeated;\n\nHe did not stand for parliament again.\n\nBusiness activity\nGrant was a Director of Anglo-Huronian, Ltd, Associated Mining and Finance Co., Ltd, Northern Rhodesia Co., Ltd, General Co-operative Investment Trust, Ltd and HE Proprietary Ltd.\n\nExternal links\nGrant at the National Portrait Gallery: http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp62247/sir-alfred-hamilton-grant-12th-bt\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "Theta Librae is a single star in the southern zodiac constellation of Libra, near the constellation border with Scorpius. Its name is a Bayer designation that is Latinized from θ Librae, and abbreviated Theta Lib or θ Lib. It is visible to the naked eye as a faint, orange-hued star with an apparent visual magnitude of 4.14. The distance to this star is approximately 168 light years, as determined by parallax, and it is drifting further away with a radial velocity of 5 km/s. The position of this star near the ecliptic means it is subject to lunar occultations.\nThis object is an aging giant star with a stellar classification of G9IIIb. Having exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core, it has cooled and expanded; at present it has 12.3 times the girth of the Sun. The star has an estimated mass about 47% greater than the Sun. It is radiating about 68 times the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of about 4,739 K.  It is probably on the red giant branch, which indicates it is generating energy through hydrogen fusion in a shell outside an inert helium core.  However, there is a 41% chance that it is a red clump giant on the horizontal branch, which would mean it was somewhat older and less massive.  It has sometimes been classified spectroscopically as a subgiant, but detailed study shows that it is too cool and luminous to be on the subgiant branch.\n\n\n== References ==",

He was also a hostage on the hijacked German Lufthansa Flight 181 in 1977.\n\nBiography\nCanellas, son of a Spanish father and a German mother, was born in Plauen, Saxony, in 1921. After the end of World War II he spent some time in Spain and then moved to Hesse and adopted German citizenship. He became the managing director of a fruit importer in Frankfurt.\nIn 1964 Canellas became chairman of Kickers Offenbach, a club then playing in the second division Regionalliga Süd. Offenbach won promotion to the Bundesliga in 1968 and 1970 but suffered immediate relegation on both occasions.\nThe day after the end of the 1970–71 Bundesliga season Canellas invited officials of the German Football Association and the press to his 50th birthday celebration. It was there that he broke the 1971 Bundesliga scandal by replaying voice recordings he had made of attempts to manipulate Bundesliga games through bribes. Earlier attempts to inform the German Association had been ignored by the latter. Canellas stepped down immediately as chairman of Kickers Offenbach and was initially banned for life from holding any office at a German football club but this ban was lifted in 1976. The following scandal took 18-months to clear up and saw 52 players and two managers banned and fined.\nCanellas retired from his business in 1974. \nOn a flight from Mallorca to Frankfurt in 1977 the plane he was on, Lufthansa Flight 181 Landshut, was hijacked by members of the PFLP in order to force the release of imprisoned German guerilla Red Army Faction leaders. The hostages were later freed by the German counter-terrorism unit GSG 9 in Mogadishu.\nCanellas died of lung cancer after a long illness in Offenbach in 1999.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "Regional Guard Brigades",
    "text": "The Regional Guard Brigades (Kurdish: لشكری پشتیوانی هەرێمی, romanized: Leshkrey Piştîwanî Herêmî, RGBs) are one of the main military formations of the Peshmerga, the armed forces of the Kurdistan Region. The brigades were created as part of efforts to unify the party-based Peshmerga forces under a more centralized command. Numbering several dozen brigades, they are formally under the authority of the Kurdistan Regional Government's (KRG) Ministry of Peshmerga Affairs (MoPA), though in practice many remain aligned with the two dominant Kurdish political parties, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). The Regional Guard Brigades have been deployed most notably in the War against the Islamic State (ISIS) from 2014 onward.\n\nHistory\nEstablishment of the MoPA\nThe MoPA was established following the creation of the autonomous Kurdistan Region in Iraq in the early 1990s as an attempt to place the Peshmerga under a unified civilian authority. Based on the 50-50 power sharing principle the KDP and PUK passed Law No. 5 transforming the Peshmerga into a regular armed force under the MoPA and prohibiting political parties from maintaining private militias. In practice, however, the ministry held little real power, as the armed forces remained divided between the KDP and the PUK. This lack of centralized control became evident during the Kurdish civil war (1994–1997), when the two parties used their separate Peshmerga forces against each other. After the conflict, the 1998 Washington Agreement, the 2006 KRG unifcation agreement following the Fall of Saddam Hussein, and the organisational reunification of the parties’ separate Peshmerga ministries in 2009, the MoPA was gradually revitalized. Under the Multinational Forces in Iraq and Article 117 of the new 2005 Iraqi Constitution the Peshmerga was legalized as one of the permissible regional groups responsible for security in the KRG.\n\n2010-2014\nIn January 2010, the first Regional Guard Brigade was established under the ministry's authority and three more RGBs were formed in the following months. In the same year, the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki officially recognised the four RGBs as full members of the Iraqi Security Forces, therefore allowing them training and incorporation under the oversight of the United States Forces in Iraq. A total of 14 supposedly apolitical RGBs were eventually formed, comprising 40,000 KDP and PUK fighters. Partisanship within the RGB remained a problem.\n\n2014-2017\nFollowing the War against the Islamic State and 2017 Kirkuk Crisis, two conflicts which exposed partisanship whitin the RGBs, the Netherlands, the US, the UK, and Germany formed the Multi-National Advisory Group (MNAG) to support the establishment of a unified \"modern, effective, affordable, and accountable Peshmerga\" under the MoPA. The MNAG pressured the KDP and PUK to establish more mixed RGBs in condition for further aid and funding. In turn the two parties united 12 to 14 brigades in the following years under the RGB.\n\n2017-2025\nA 35-point plan (now refined to 31 points) for unification, jointly developed with the US, UK, and Germany was being implemented by the MoPA between 2017 and 2022.\nIn 2021 and 2022, the KDP's 1st Support Forces and the PUK's 2nd Support Forces were integrated into the MoPA, a move described by Col. Todd Burroughs, deputy director of the US-led coalition's Military Advisor Group North, as a 'significant step in the Peshmerga reform process.' These units provide unprecedented support functions for the RGBs.\n\n2022 MoU\nA major step towards unification was reached in 2022, when a four-year memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the US Department of Defense and Ministry of Peshmerga Affairs was signed, outlining conditions and timelines for integration into MoPA, effective until September 2026.\nBy 2025, unification was in its final phase, with 10 additional RGBs formed.  As of Q2 2025, 28 Regional Guard Brigades were unified, 4 divisions operational, biometric enrollment exceeded 85%, and a four-year budget was submitted for a 138,000-strong force. Salary digitization via 'MyAccount' was nearing completion.\n\nFuture outlook\nIn spite of all reforms, officers partially still continue to report to and take orders from their party leaders who also control the deployment of forces loyal to them and appoint front-line and sector commanders. Critical reforms stalled include the full integration of Unit 80 and Unit 70 into the RGBs and additional division HQs, amid U.S. frustration over partisanship. Peshmerga officials repeatedly affirm that full unification will be completed by 2026, if not sooner and U.S. officials stress that they will continue supporting unifying efforts.\n\nStructure\nWith 28 unified Regional Guard Brigades (RGB), the Ministry commands 74,400 Peshmerga soldiers, of whom 34,900 are based in the Erbil Governorate, 23,800 in the Duhok Governorate, and 15,700 in the Sulaymaniyah Governorate.\nThe 1st Support Forces and the 2nd Support Forces provide the RGBs with critical support functions.\nThe MoPA is aiming to establish enough RGBs so that they can form 11 divisions by 2026. As of November 2024 the RGBs are organized within 4 MoPA divisions.\n\nTraining\nAs part of international efforts to depoliticize and professionalize the Peshmerga, the Regional Guard Brigades have received more extensive training than the party-affiliated units. Much of this training has been conducted at Kurdistan Training Coordination Center (KTCC) facilities, operated by a nine-nation coalition. Trainers are provided by Italy, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Norway, Finland, the United Kingdom, and Turkey, with Slovenia contributing an administrative officer. The United States has supplied weapons and equipment in support of the program.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "Mita Avramov",
    "text": "Mita Avramov (Serbian Cyrillic: Мита Аврамов; born 22 August 1952) is a Serbian politician. He has served in the National Assembly of Serbia and the Assembly of Vojvodina and was the mayor of Šid from 2004 to 2008. He was a member of the far-right Serbian Radical Party (SRS) for many years and later joined the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS).\n\nEarly life and career\nAvramov was born in the village of Mokrin in the municipality of Kikinda, Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, in what was then the People's Republic of Serbia in the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. He is a mechanical technician.\n\nPolitician\nAvramov appeared in the second position on the Radical Party's electoral list for the Sremska Mitrovica division in the 1996 Yugoslavian parliamentary election. The list won one seat in the division, which went to its lead candidate, Radislav Rosić. Avramov also ran for Šid's second division in the concurrent 1996 Vojvodina provincial election and was defeated.\n\nFirst term in parliament\nAvramov received the fourth position on the Radical Party's list for Sremska Mitrovica in the 1997 Serbian parliamentary election. The list won four seats, and he was assigned a mandate. (From 1992 to 2000, Serbia's electoral law stipulated that one-third of parliamentary mandates would be assigned to candidates from successful lists in numerical order, while the remaining two-thirds would be distributed amongst other candidates on the lists at the discretion of the sponsoring parties. It was common practice for the latter mandates to be awarded out of order. Avramov did not automatically receive a mandate by virtue of his list position.) The Radical Party won eighty-two seats in total, finishing second against the governing Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS). The SPS formed a new coalition government with the SRS and the Yugoslav Left (JUL) in March 1998, and Avramov served as a supporter of the administration. He was one of several Serbian officials placed under sanction by European Union countries in March 2000, in the aftermath of the Kosovo War and the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.\nSPS leader Slobodan Milošević was defeated by Democratic Opposition of Serbia candidate Vojislav Koštunica in the 2000 Yugoslavian presidential election, a watershed moment in Serbian and Yugoslavian politics. The Serbian government fell, and the Radicals moved into opposition in the Serbian assembly. Avramov ran unsuccessfully for Šid's first division in the 2000 Vojvodina provincial election and for Šid's twenty-seventh division in the 2000 Serbian local elections, both of which were held concurrently with the Yugoslavian vote.\nSerbia held a new parliamentary election in December 2000. Its electoral laws were reformed prior to the vote, such that the entire country became a single electoral division and all mandates were awarded to candidates on successful lists at the discretion of the sponsoring parties or coalitions, irrespective of numerical order. Avramov appeared in the seventy-ninth position on the SRS list and did not receive a new mandate when the party fell to twenty-three seats.\n\n2003–2012\nAvramov was given the eightieth position on the Radical Party's list in the 2003 Serbian parliamentary election. The party won eighty-two seats; he was not initially included in its assembly delegation but received a new mandate on 17 February 2004 as the replacement for another member. Although the SRS won more seats than any other party in the 2003 election, it fell short of a majority and ultimately served in opposition. Avramov served on the committee for industry and the committee for petitions and proposals.\nSerbia introduced the direct election of mayors in the 2004 Serbian local elections. Avramov ran for mayor of Šid and was elected in the second round of voting. He was also elected to Vojvodina assembly for Šid in the concurrent 2004 provincial election. The Democratic Party (DS) and its allies formed government at the provincial level, and the Radicals served in opposition.\nAvramov received the forty-ninth position on the SRS's list in the 2007 parliamentary election. The party won eighty-one seats, but he was not given a seat in the new legislature. He appeared in the 114th position in the 2008 parliamentary election and again did not receive a mandate when the list won seventy-eight seats.\nThe direct election of mayors proved to be a short-lived experiment, and since 2008 mayors have been chosen by the elected members of the local assemblies. Avramov led the Radical Party's list for Šid in the 2008 local elections; the party won thirteen seats, finishing second against the Democratic Party, and he served in opposition for the four-year term that followed. He was defeated in the 2008 Vojvodina provincial election.\nThe Radical Party experienced a serious split in late 2008, with several members joining the more moderate Serbian Progressive Party under the leadership of Tomislav Nikolić and Aleksandar Vučić. Avramov initially remained with the Radicals. In October 2008, he was accused by the local G17 Plus board of illegally dismissing municipal workers affiliated with other parties during his time as mayor.\n\nSince 2012\nSerbia's electoral laws were reformed in 2011, such that mandates were awarded to candidates on successful lists in numerical order. Avramov received the sixty-second position on the Radical Party's list in the 2012 Serbian parliamentary election. The list did not cross the electoral threshold for representation in the assembly.\nAvramov later joined the Progressive Party, which won a majority victory in Šid in the 2016 Serbian local elections. He was appointed to the municipal council (i.e., the executive branch of the municipal government) after the election and served for the next four years.\n\nElectoral record\nProvincial (Vojvodina)\nLocal (Šid)\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "Hanosaurus is an extinct genus of marine reptiles that existed during the Triassic period in what is now China. The type species is Hanosaurus hupehensis. It was a small animal, with specimens measuring 79.4 cm (31.3 in) long in total body length, which likely fed on soft-bodied prey.\n\nDiscovery\nHanosaurus (lizard of Han River) was discovered from the Sonshugo locality of Hubei, China. It was found at the second member of the Jialingjiang Formation. The type specimen consisted of a skull, complete hindlimbs and pelvis, incomplete shoulder girdle represented by coracoid and clavicle, and an articulated but incomplete vertebral column. It was initially described as a thalattosaur but subsequent research showed it was more likely to be a sauropterygia.\nA more complete referred specimen was described in 2022 from the Yingzishan locality of Hubei, China. The specimen was also found at the second member of the Jialingjiang formation. It consisted of almost the entire skeleton preserved with its ventral side up. However, a later study has cast doubt on the referral of this specimen to Hanosaurus.\n\nPhylogenetic placement\nRieppel's 1998 reassessment recovered Hanosaurus within a monophyletic pachypleurosaurid in a phylogenetic analysis featuring diapsids. Its placement within Sauropterygia, however, was rather inconsistent between different subsequent studies. Some studies support Rieppel 1998's pachypleurosaur placement; some found it to be more closely related to Nothosauridae than other pachypleurosaurs; some found it to be the sister taxon to a clade consisted of Nothosauridae and Pachypleurosauridae; some found it to be the sister taxon to eosauropterygia; while some recovered it to be a basal sauropterygia or outside of Sauropterygia altogether.\nA 2024 study by Hu, Li & Liu recovered Hanosaurus as the sister taxon of the clade formed by the Nothosauroidea and the Pachypleurosauria. The results of their phylogenetic analyses are shown in the cladogram below:\n\nTaxonomy\nRieppel (1998) diagnosed Hanosaurus as a small pachypluerosaurid with the following features:\n\nNasal bigger than frontal\nFrontal fused in adults\nPineal foramen placed more anteriorly\nPubis and ischium with rounded edge, no thyroid fenestra\nFollowing the description of the referred specimen and the placement of the taxon being the most basal sauropterygiform (a clade that includes sauropterygia, Helveticosaurus, and Saurosphargidae), Wang et al. (2022) diagnosed Hanosaurus as a medium sized sauropterygiform with the following characteristics:\n\nSnout without constriction\nSupratemporal fenestra smaller than orbits\nNasals longer than frontals\nMandibular articulation far posterior to the occiput, with retroarticular  process well developed\nAnterior teeth short and conical\nPosterior teeth constricted at the base, with the lingual surface of tooth crown slightly concave\nCervical ribs with anterior process\nDorsal ribs pachyostotic\nCoracoid not waisted (Note: The holotype has a waisted coracoid)\nPubis extremely round\nIschium kidney shaped\nNo distinctive thyroid fenestra between pubis and ischium\nMinimally four carpals and three tarsals\nWolniewicz et al. (2023), however, pointed out the difference between coracoid morphology between the referred specimen and the holotype, with the former having a circular shape and the latter having a waisted shape similar to that of other sauropterygias. They also pointed out that the referred specimen and holotype were not recovered as sister taxon to each other in their phylogenetic analyses. If this is correct, then the previous diagnosis can no longer be used as it's partly based on the referred specimen. They instead suggested that the referred specimen might be that of \"Lariosaurus\" sanxiaensis, a larger sauropterygia from the same formation based on similar coracoid morphology.\n\nLifestyle (Based on the referred specimen)\nDespite being a basal sauropterygian, Hanosaurus probably did not go on land frequently and was mostly aquatic based on features such as pachyostoic ribs and reduced pelvis that likely could not support it on land. \nWang et al. (2022) suggested that Hanosaurus was an axial swimmer based on its longer trunk and smaller limbs compared to other sauropterygias, which were generally considered to be paraxial swimmers. The speculation about its lifestyle was mostly based on the referred specimen, which as noted by the section above might belong to another species.\n\nEnvironment and associated fauna\nHanosaurus was found in the second member of the Jialingjiang Formation, which was suggested to represent a lagoon deposit close to sea based on the way water depth changed between localities.\nHanosaurus was part of the Nanzhang-Yuan'an fauna. The fauna also contained other sauropterygians (\"Lariosaurus\" sanxiaensis, Keichousaurus yunnanensis, and an unnamed large eosauropterygian), Saurosphargidae (Pomolispondylus and Prosaurosphargis), ichthyosaur (Chaohusaurus zhangjiawanensis), and hupesuchias (Hupehsuchus, Nanchangosaurus, Parahupehsuchus, Eohupehsuchus, and Eretmorhipis), the last of which was only present in this faunal assemblage. Not much is known about the ecology of Hanosaurus, although small pachypleurosaurs were suggested to be small invertebrate predators based on jaw musculatures.\n\nReferences\n\n\n== See also ==",

    "title": "In Our Time (radio series)",
    "text": "In Our Time is a BBC Radio 4 discussion series and podcast exploring a wide variety of historical, scientific and philosophical topics, presented by Melvyn Bragg, since 15 October 1998. In December 2025, Misha Glenny was announced as programme's new presenter.\nIt is one of Radio 4's most successful discussion programmes, acknowledged to have \"transformed the landscape for serious ideas at peak listening time\".\nThe series passed its 1,000th episode in September 2023 and attracts a weekly audience exceeding two million listeners.\nOn 3 September 2025, the BBC reported that Bragg had decided to retire from the programme ahead of its new series as a new presenter would be announced in due course. \nOn 3 December 2025, the BBC announced that Misha Glenny would take over as the new presenter from 15 January 2026.\n\nProgramme\nThe series, devised and produced by Olivia Seligman (with others) and currently produced by Simon Tillotson with Victoria Brignell, runs weekly throughout the year on BBC Radio 4, except for a summer break of approximately eight to ten weeks between July and September. Each programme covers a specific historical, philosophical, religious, cultural or scientific topic. In a November 2009 interview, Bragg described how he prepares for each show: \"It's not easy, but I like reading. I enjoy what was called swotting in my day. I get the notes late Friday afternoon for the following Thursday morning. I find all the spare time I can for reading, get up very early on a Thursday morning, have a final two hours of nervousness, and away we go.\"\nBragg hosts discussion of the week's subject featuring what he has characterised as \"three absolutely top-class academics\" on the subject. The programme is normally broadcast live and unedited on Thursday mornings at 9 a.m., lasting around 42 minutes, and is then available online. He begins each episode with a short summary of the week's topic, then introduces the three guests. He guides the discussion along a generally chronological route, then either concludes the programme himself or invites summation remarks from one of the specialists.\n\nBragg gives short shrift to pretension of any kind, while remaining stalwart in his search for knowledge. His methodology in In Our Time is... not unlike that of a man throwing a stick for a dog: he chucks his questions ahead, and if the chosen academic fails to bring it right back, he chides them. He retains enough of his bluff Cumbrian origins not to be taken in by gambolling and tweedy high spirits.\n\nHistory\nIn Our Time was conceived for Bragg in 1998 after he was forced to quit his decade-long role as presenter for Start the Week due to a perceived conflict of interest arising from his appointment as a Labour life peer. He was offered the Thursday \"death-slot\" and decided he would \"do what [he] always wanted to do,\" and \"hastily battered out a simple idea\" with producer Olivia Seligman expecting the show would only last a few months. By September 1999, he had taken a time slot that was previously attracting an audience of 600,000 and grown it to 1.5 million. By 2000, the half-hour show was expanded to 45 minutes and to include three guest speakers. \nIn 2004, the programme was made available as a podcast from the BBC website and iTunes for one week after broadcast. Until July 2014, listeners could also sign up for weekly email newsletters from Bragg, where he mentioned any additional information relating to the programme, along with snippets from his own personal and intellectual life. In 2009, selected transcripts of episodes from the programme were compiled in the book In Our Time: A Companion to the Radio 4 series, edited by Bragg. Since 2010, every episode of the programme has been available from its website as streaming audio, making it one of the first BBC programmes to have its entire archive released. Since 2011, the entire archive has been available to download as individual podcasts.\nOn 3 September 2025 Melvyn Bragg announced that he was stepping down as presenter.\n\nCultural impact\nThe programme is considered one of the BBC's most successful projects, acknowledged to have \"transformed the landscape for serious ideas at peak listening time\". Frequent contributors to the programme since 1998 include Angie Hobbs, Simon Schaffer, Martin Palmer, Steve Jones , Paul Cartledge, Carolin Crawford, Edith Hall, A. C. Grayling, Patricia Fara, David Wootton, Jonathan Bate, and Karen O'Brien.\nIn 2005, listeners were invited to vote in a popularity contest for the \"greatest philosopher in history\" with the winner selected as the subject of the final programme before the summer break. With 30,000 votes cast, the contest was won by Karl Marx with 27.9% of the votes. Other shortlisted figures were David Hume (12.7%), Ludwig Wittgenstein (6.8%), Friedrich Nietzsche (6.5%), Plato (5.6%), Immanuel Kant (5.6%), Thomas Aquinas (4.8%), Socrates (4.8%), Aristotle (4.5%) and Karl Popper (4.2%). The poll was controversial but led to widespread reporting, and a boost in the programme's overall listenership, as various UK celebrities and news outlets championed their favourites.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nIn Our Time BBC Radio 4 homepage, with iPlayer archive of past programmes\nIn Our Time at IMDb\nA Dewey Decimal classification of In Our Time episodes",

    "title": "Glace Bay",
    "text": "Glace Bay is a community in the eastern part of the Cape Breton Regional Municipality in Nova Scotia, Canada.  It forms part of the general area referred to as Industrial Cape Breton.\nFormerly an incorporated town (1901–1995), the municipal government in Glace Bay was dissolved and the community was amalgamated into the larger regional municipality. Prior to amalgamation, Glace Bay had been the province's fourth largest urban area and the largest town in Nova Scotia by population.\nNeighbouring communities include Reserve Mines, Dominion, and Tower Road.\n\nHistory\nAs early as the 1720s, the French inhabited the area to supply Fortress of Louisbourg with coal. They named the location baie de Glace (literally, Bay of Ice) because of the sea ice which filled the ocean each winter. In 1748, after the capture of Fortress Louisbourg, the British constructed Fort William at Table Head in order to protect a mine that produced coal to supply the Louisbourg garrison. The fort itself was a blockhouse, brought from Boston, with a palisade. When Cape Breton Island was returned to French control, Fort William continued in service until 1752 when it was destroyed by fire.\n\nMore permanent settlement of Glace Bay probably can be dated from 1818 when Walter Blackett obtained a grant of land on the south side of the Bay. Coal mining existed on a small scale until the 1860s, when four mines were in operation within the future town boundaries. These included the Hub, Harbour, Caledonia and Glace Bay Collieries. The first large mine, the Hub Shaft of Glace Bay opened in 1861 and a total of 12 mines in Glace Bay were in operation. Following the formation of the Dominion Coal Company in 1893, the coal mining industry expanded significantly in what was to become Glace Bay with the opening of several new mines. In 1894, the government gave exclusive mining rights to the Dominion Coal Company.\nSmall communities grew up around the mines and by 1901 they came together to form the Town of Glace Bay. At the time of incorporation, the population was 6,945. During the early 20th century, mining companies recruited in the American South for workers, attracting African Americans from Mississippi. By the 1940s, the figure exceeded 28,000 and Glace Bay became Canada's largest town (in population). At one time, the town had 12 collieries but none remains. Because of this industrial decline, jobs left and the core population decreased to 16,984 as of 2001. The city has been dissolved/deincorporated since municipal amalgamation in 1995, which formed the Cape Breton Regional Municipality.\n\nEconomy\nGlace Bay was once a coal mining town. In 1860, the Glace Bay Mining Company was formed and it operated two mines. The first large colliery, the Hub Shaft, opened in 1861. Large-scale mining commenced in 1893 after exclusive mining rights were granted to the Dominion Coal Company. Glace Bay was incorporated as a town on January 18, 1901. At its high point the company operated eleven mines in all, and was responsible for 40% of Canada's coal production.  Coal was transported on the Sydney and Louisburg Railway to both of those ports for shipping. The S & L Railway's main operations, including the roundhouse and machine shops were located in Glace Bay. Glace Bay's extensive coal and rail operations made the town the industrial center of Cape Breton. As coal mining became less important, the mines were closed until, in 1984 Colliery No. 26 was closed by the Cape Breton Development Corporation. Many residents of Glace Bay started to work at the two other coal mines in the area: Prince Colliery in Point Aconi and Phalen Colliery and Lingan Colliery in Lingan. However, coal mining continued its decline with Lingan closing in the mid-1990s, followed by Phalen in 1999 and Prince in 2001.\nFishing was also an important industry throughout the 20th century. However, by the 1990s fish stocks were so depleted that the fishery was closed. Some fish processing still occurs here.\n\nPresent day\nThe former town of Glace Bay has a population of slightly fewer than 20,000 people.  In 2001, a call centre operated by Stream Global Services, using post-industrialization subsidies, opened. The building is today owned by Concentrix.\nThe Swiss mining consortium Xstrata was the primary partner in the Donkin Coal Development Alliance, which won the rights to develop an abandoned mine site in the nearby community of Donkin. Currently, the mine is owned by Kameron Collieries, a subsidiary of Cline Group LLC, which purchased the operation in 2014–2015. Coal production commenced in February 2016 and by the fall of 2018, the mine had 120 employees.\n\nHistorical features and places\nMarconi National Historic Site\nThe Marconi National Historic Site of Canada is located at Table Head in Glace Bay. Parks Canada maintains an interpretive centre at the site honouring the role of Guglielmo Marconi in the development of radio communications. In December 1902, Marconi transmitted the first complete messages to Poldhu from stations at Glace Bay, Nova Scotia.\nMarconi chose this site for its elevated flat expanse and unobstructed view out over the ocean. Some of the concrete footings for the massive towers can still be seen on the grounds.  Marconi built a much larger wireless site west of here then known as Marconi Towers.  In 1907 he initiated the first permanent transatlantic wireless service from Marconi Towers to its companion site in Clifden, Ireland.\n\nCape Breton Miners Museum\nThe Cape Breton Miners Museum is located on top of the Ocean Deep Colliery, which is only 1 kilometer from downtown Glace Bay. The museum is privately run and relies on donations and government grants for its operations. During the summer season, the museum offers a walking underground mine tour with a retired coal miner, and a virtual simulator tour of an underground mine. The museum is also home to The Men of the Deeps choir.\n\nSavoy Theatre\nThe Savoy Theatre is a historic Victorian-Style theatre, established in 1901, with the present theatre building dating from 1927, operating as an arts and culture centre in Glace Bay. Its main auditorium has a capacity of 761 including the balcony. The Savoy's foyer also hosts events (dinner theatres, weddings, reunions) for up to 100 people.\nThe Savoy stage has been graced by a virtual Who's Who of Cape Breton and Canadian talent, including Rita MacNeil, The Rankin Family, The Barra MacNeils, Ashley MacIssac, The White Stripes, The Barenaked Ladies, k.d. lang, Mr. Dressup, Sarah McLaughlin, The Royal Winnipeg Ballet, Blue Rodeo, Liona Boyd, Harry Chapin, Melissa Etheridge, Leonard Cohen, and hundreds of others.\n\nGeography\nLandscape\nThe local landscape is heavily forested and hilly.  Some of the low-lying areas at the bottom of hills consist of marshes and bogs. There are rocky cliffs around the ocean along most of the coast and erosion continues to be a problem in some areas; part of North Street fell into the ocean due to erosion and the street was split into Upper and Lower North Street.\n\nMany areas surrounding former coal mines are experiencing subsidence as the old mine shafts collapse.  There are several brownfields around the community at former industrial sites.\n\nFlora and fauna\nGlace Bay has a large amount of forests and swamp surrounding the town and within the town limits. Mammals present in Glace Bay include squirrels, rabbits, fox, deer, mice, muskrats, cats, dogs,  and coyotes. Bird species include ducks, great horned owls, Canada geese, crows, gulls, and pigeons. Pheasants are occasionally seen around wooded areas. Smaller birds such as robins, black capped chickadees, and sparrows are also present. Frogs, salamanders, and snakes are also common in Glace Bay.\nGlace Bay and the surrounding areas are heavily forested. Common deciduous trees in Glace Bay include poplar, maples, and birches. Oaks, elms and beech trees are also present but they are less common. Common conifers include spruce and balsam with some pine and tamaracks present as well.\nThe introduced Asian plants of Japanese and Giant Knotweed are common throughout the town and surrounding woodlands and are colloquially known as \"elephant ears\".\n\nClimate\nGlace Bay experiences a cool summer, and windy, wet and stormy winter, a version of a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfb) that is significantly moderated by the community's proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. The highest temperature ever recorded in Glace Bay was 36.7 °C (98 °F) on 18 August 1935. The lowest temperature ever recorded was −31.7 °C (−25 °F) on 31 January 1873, 29 January 1877 and 15 February 1916.\nBecause of its close proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, Glace Bay, like all of Cape Breton Island, experiences strong seasonal lag. The ocean does not reach its maximum temperature until mid August. It usually stays there until early September. This makes August the hottest month in Glace Bay rather than July which is usually the hottest in most northern continental climates. February is also the coldest month on average rather than January.\n\nPolitics\nFederally, Glace Bay is located in the riding of Cape Breton–Canso, currently held by Liberal MP Mike Kelloway. Provincially, the riding of Glace Bay-Dominion is currently held by Progressive Conservative MLA John White who was elected in the 2021 Nova Scotia provincial election. The riding had been held previously by Liberal MLA Geoff MacLellan who did not re-offer.\n\nMayors of Glace Bay\nWhile Glace Bay was a town, the following people were its mayor:\n\nDavid M.

    "text": "The Staffordshire Rugby Union is the governing body for the sport of rugby union in the county of Staffordshire in England. The union is the constituent body of the Rugby Football Union (RFU) for Staffordshire, and administers and organises rugby union clubs and competitions in the county. It also administers the Staffordshire county rugby representative teams.\n\nHistory\nAlthough there had been a number of long established clubs such as Burton (founded in 1870), Lichfield (1874) and Wolverhampton (1875), it took until 1923 for the Staffordshire Rugby Union to be formed, when it was part of the North Midlands Rugby Football Union. As the county started to find its identity in the 1920s more sides would start to form, with clubs such as Walsall (1921) and Stafford (1925) coming into existence during this period.\nDespite its formation in 1923, Staffordshire would not be recognised as a constituent body by the RFU until the 1960s. In 1961 a representative side defeated the reigning county champions Cheshire in a friendly match. This result showed the RFU that Staffordshire were ready to be included in the County Championships and the following year they would take part for the first time, being finally awarded constituent body status in 1962. On 14 March 1970, Staffordshire won the County Championship when they upset favourites Gloucestershire 11–9 in the final played at Peel Croft in Burton upon Trent.\nSince the glory days of 1970 Staffordshire have failed to win another county championship, and the reformation of the county game at the start of the 21st century saw them drop down to the third tier. In 2016 Staffordshire won both of their pool games in the Shield competition, reaching Twickenham for the very first time. Unfortunately they were unable to add to their silverware as they were beaten 11–30 by Hampshire in the final. Despite losing the final, Staffordshire were promoted to tier 2 of the championships along with winners Hampshire, for the 2017 competition.\n\nStaffordshire senior men's county side\nThe Staffordshire seniors men's team currently play in Division 2 of the County Championship.\nHonours:\n\nCounty Championship winners: 1970\n\nAffiliated clubs\nThere are currently 31 clubs affiliated with the Staffordshire RU, most of which have teams at both senior and junior level and are based in Staffordshire and bordering parts of the West Midlands. Due to county boundary changes enforced by the Local Government Act 1972, several clubs (but not all) who are based in what is now known as West Midlands are also members of the North Midlands RFU as well as the Staffordshire RU.\n\nCounty club competitions\nThe Staffordshire RU currently runs the following competitions for club sides based in Staffordshire:\n\nCups\nStaffordshire Senior Cup – introduced in 1976, open to local clubs playing at tiers 5–7 of the English rugby union league system\nStaffordshire Intermediate Cup – introduced in 2001, open to clubs at tiers 7–8\nStaffordshire Owen Cup – introduced in 1980, open to clubs at tiers 8–10\n\nDiscontinued competitions\nStaffordshire/Warwickshire 1 – tier 7-10 league for Staffordshire and Warwickshire clubs that ran between 1987 and 2000\nStaffordshire/Warwickshire 2 – tier 10-11 league for Staffordshire and Warwickshire clubs that ran between 1992 and 1996\nStaffordshire/Warwickshire 3 – tier 11-12 league for Staffordshire and Warwickshire clubs that ran between 1992 and 1996\nStaffordshire/Warwickshire 4 – tier 12-13 league for Staffordshire and Warwickshire clubs that ran between 1992 and 1996\nStaffordshire 1 – tier 8-10 league that ran intermittently between 1987 and 2005\nStaffordshire 2 – tier 10-11 league that ran intermittently between 1987 and 2004\nMidlands 5 West (North) – tier 10 league for Staffordshire and North Midlands clubs that ran between 2005 and 2019\n\nNotes\nSee also\nMidland Division\nEnglish rugby union system\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nStaffordshire RU website",

    "text": "Bloodline is an American psychological thriller television series created by Todd A. Kessler, Glenn Kessler, and Daniel Zelman, and produced by Sony Pictures Television. The series premiered on February 9, 2015, in the Berlinale Special Galas section of the 65th Berlin International Film Festival, and the 13-episode first season premiered in its entirety, on Netflix, on March 20, 2015. On March 31, 2015, Bloodline was renewed for a 10-episode second season that debuted on May 27, 2016. On July 13, 2016, Netflix renewed Bloodline for a 10-episode third season, later confirmed to be the final season. The third and final season was released on May 26, 2017.\nThe first season received positive reviews from many critics, with most praising its performances (particularly for Ben Mendelsohn and Kyle Chandler) and cinematography. However, the second and third seasons received mixed responses from critics.\n\nPlot\nSeason 1 (2015)\nThe series begins with narration by John Rayburn:\n\nSometimes you know something's coming. You feel it. In the air. In your gut. And you don't sleep at night. The voice in your head is telling you that something is going to go terribly wrong and there's nothing you can do to stop it. That's how I felt when my brother came home.\nDanny Rayburn returns home to Islamorada, Florida, for the 45th anniversary of his parents' Robert and Sally Rayburn's seaside inn, the Rayburn House; a pier will be dedicated in their honor to mark the occasion. Danny is the black sheep of the family, among them his three younger siblings: John, Kevin, and Meg. John is a detective with the local sheriff's office, Kevin owns a local marina, and Meg is an attorney with a local law firm. Danny wants to make his return permanent as he wishes to stay to help his parents at their inn. Robert is reluctant to let Danny stay, but leaves it up to the three siblings to decide Danny's fate.\nThe siblings decide against Danny staying as they conclude that he will only break their mother's heart in the end. John breaks the news to Danny, but lies to him by telling him it was their father who ultimately wanted him gone, rather than the siblings. Even though he gets a ride to the bus station from John, in the end, Danny does not leave. Danny's confrontation with his father inadvertently causes Robert to have mini-strokes, which eventually cause his death.\nThe Rayburns' past is full of deep, dark secrets that are revealed throughout the season. Danny's dysfunctional relationship with his family primarily stems from the untimely death of his younger sister, Sarah, when he was a teenager. Danny took Sarah out on a boat. Her seahorse necklace fell into the water, and when she attempted to retrieve it, she drowned. Robert lost control and beat Danny severely, believing he was in some way responsible for her death. Sally covered up this abuse by pushing John, Kevin, and Meg to lie to the police about their brother's injuries, which they now claim were the result of Danny being hit by a drunk driver.\nRobert's death now opens the door for Danny to have a permanent job at the inn. Danny appears to be changing his ways with hard work and dedication, which puts him in Sally's good graces. However, Danny's dark past is revealed via his connection with childhood friend and local troublemaker Eric O'Bannon. The two begin siphoning gasoline from local docks for drug dealer and human trafficker Wayne Lowry. As they gain Lowry's trust, they are given larger jobs to complete. Danny eventually uses his job at the Rayburn House as a front to smuggle cocaine for Lowry.\nJohn and the sheriff's department collaborate with the DEA in an investigation into the deaths of unknown women and drug trafficking in Monroe County by Lowry and his men. The investigation leads John directly to Danny and his recent activities. While secretly investigating Danny, John discovers Danny's smuggled cocaine in a shed on the Rayburn House property. During a meeting between John, Kevin, and Meg, the three siblings conclude that the only way to fix the situation and not put the family's business at risk with the Feds is to move the drugs to Danny's condo in Miami without telling Danny. The loss of the drugs puts Danny in a bad situation with Lowry, who believes that Danny has stolen the cocaine from him. Lowry sends a hitman to assassinate Danny, but Danny kills the hitman instead.\nUnder pressure, Danny begins to act erratically. He tries to intimidate John by taking his daughter Jane out on a boat and giving her a seahorse necklace, similar to the one that belonged to their deceased sister, Sarah. John and his wife Diana take this as a threat against the family, so John sends his wife and children away for a few days. The seahorse necklace causes John to reach his breaking point. During a confrontation, John drowns Danny in the ocean. Distraught from murdering his brother, John has a heart problem (atrial fibrillation) and turns to Meg for help. Meg and Kevin decide to cover up the murder by moving Danny's body. John eventually sets a boat on fire to create an explosion that would frame Danny's death. Unsatisfied with what she is being told, Sally turns to long-time family friend and retired detective Lenny Potts to privately investigate the matter. In the aftermath of Danny's death, Meg moves to New York City to take a job with a large firm; Kevin reunites with his estranged wife, Belle, who is now pregnant with their child; and John reunites with Diana and his family. The season ends with the arrival of Danny's son, Nolan, at John's home to find out what happened to his father.\n\nSeason 2 (2016)\nDanny's death continues to haunt the Rayburn family. Wayne Lowry confronts John, claiming to have a tape recorded by Danny that could be used as blackmail against John. John's deputy Marco Diaz continues to question people in relation to Danny's death, including Eric O'Bannon. Meg returns from New York, John runs for Sheriff, and Kevin continues to struggle with his failing business. Nolan and his mother Eve arrive at the Rayburn house and meet Sally to discuss Danny. Through Nolan and Eve, the Rayburns learn more about Danny's past, including his asking Robert to borrow some money for his restaurant. Robert made him choose between that or his continuing to send money to Eve for Nolan's support. Ozzy, an old friend of Danny's from Miami, has gotten involved with Eve and works with her to appeal Meg's cancellation after her father's death of the payments to Eve for child support of Nolan. John tries to get the tape from Lowry by telling him to turn himself in so that the DEA can arrest his contacts and his family will be protected. Lowry considers the offer, but backs down due to Kevin giving back some of the drugs Danny had. Lowry is killed by the father of one of the victims killed when he blew up a boat containing people they were trafficking. While John runs for Sheriff, Marco gets closer to finding Danny's killer. Marco, who used to have a relationship with Meg, grows to resent the Rayburn family for lying and telling contradictory stories. Eric O'Bannon tells Marco he has proof that John killed Danny.

The series was created and executive produced by Todd A. Kessler, Glenn Kessler, and Daniel Zelman, who previously created the FX series Damages. According to its official synopsis released by Netflix, Bloodline \"centers on a close-knit family of four adult siblings whose secrets and scars are revealed when their black sheep brother returns home.\"\nThe writing trio settled on the theme of family as they tried to determine what their next project would look like. According to Zelman, \"Over the years we've found ourselves talking a lot about family and how family dynamics have changed — or not changed — as we've gotten older.\" Glenn Kessler added, \"As we've hit our 40s, our understanding of our family dynamics has begun to change. And because we all come from families with three sons, we recognize the roles we play. It's something we'd been talking about. So the thought was, why not try to mine some of that in our creative life?\"\nThey settled on a family-thriller genre, set in the Florida Keys, which explored the ghost of the past in family role formation. The pitch was attractive to a number of outlets before Netflix landed the drama as a 13-hour season to launch all at once — a structural advantage very important to the show's creators.\n\nCasting\nThe creators were intrigued by the idea of casting Kyle Chandler, whose on-screen persona in Friday Night Lights was warm and inviting, to play the ostensibly noble but deeply flawed John Rayburn. They met with Chandler in Austin, Texas, and pitched the part: \"This is like an experiment. We're not quite sure if this is going to work the way we're doing it, but we want to try to create this family dynamic we're aware of and create this family around it. And their hesitancy of whether it would work or not...  made me, thinking back on it, realize they were into it 110% because they were trying to create something new. I didn't know what would happen with it or where it could go... But I was like, I'm in.\"\nBen Mendelsohn was the only actor whom the producers met with for the role of Danny Rayburn; they found his combination of intellect and acting ability perfectly suited to the part. Glenn Kessler was grateful for Netflix's hands-off approach to the decision, explaining, \"They very much supported us finding the best actor that we thought could play the role.\"\nIn addition, as much of the show's dramatic tension comes from the relationship between John and Danny, a certain chemistry between the two actors was vital. According to Chandler, \"[Mendelsohn]'s so easy to work with. And yet, he's tricky — when you're working with him, [psychologically] there's so much going on.\"\nLinda Cardellini and Norbert Leo Butz secured their parts as siblings Meg and Kevin Rayburn, respectively, through meetings with the creators. According to Kessler, Sissy Spacek and Sam Shepard were described prior to casting as the \"dream\" actors they would want to play the Rayburn parents. A Damages fan, Spacek signed on after the cast started coming together, explaining, \"There's so much good work coming out of television. I wanted to be a part of it.\"\nThe second season features the additions of John Leguizamo and Andrea Riseborough as series regulars, both playing characters from Danny's past. Ben Mendelsohn returns as a series regular for the second season, despite his character's having been killed off in season 1. Kessler said: \"The DNA of the show is such that the past is always with us,\" and \"We're going to learn more about Danny's effect on the family and more about his past, and also what his effects are in the present day... [Mendelsohn's return] was always part of the plan. When we first hired him, it was for more than the first season.\"\nThe third season features Chloë Sevigny as a series regular; she had previously recurred in seasons 1 and 2.\n\nFilming\nTodd A. Kessler described why they shot the show on location in the Florida Keys: \"We looked at several places and realized there is no place quite like the Keys and the color of the water and being outside and it really feeling like paradise and then having this kind of underbelly of what's going on underneath it.\"\nThe creators acknowledged Crime and Punishment as a major narrative influence for what they described as a 13-hour movie. As Kessler explained: \"In that story the murder takes place at about page 60 and there's another 400 pages of the book to go. The tagline that we use for promotion — We're not bad people, but we did a bad thing — is very much the fabric of the series. The first season just gets us to the starting line.\"\nThe show favors a mix of classic noir and hyper-realism in its look. Cinematographer Jaime Reynoso said, \"he never saw [Bloodline] as a TV show\", finding the all-at-once Netflix model useful in filming the series as if it were a shorter film. He explained, \"The concept the writers had was they wanted it hyper-realistic, almost documentary style.\" He found first takes were often the best, with actors not rehearsing in order to maintain spontaneity. Bloodline editor Naomi Geraghty also stressed the importance of realism to the show: \"Nobody is ever saying what they're saying, so part of how you build on that is by staying with those moments and you save sharp or jarring cuts for flashbacks.\"\n\nProduction cost\nIn September 2016, Vulture reported that the cost per episode for the show was approximately US$7 million to US$8.5 million per hour, with a total cost for the 33 episodes between US$231–US$289 million. Despite receiving tax credits for shooting in Florida, shooting in the Florida Keys was costly. The high production cost is cited as one of the reasons for cancellation, despite positive reviews and award nominations. Executive producer Todd A. Kessler said: \"We decided to set the show there ... because it's crucial to what the show is, not because of the tax incentive, but it does affect things financially for us and the show will be challenged because of that. It makes things more difficult\".\n\nReception\nCritical\nSeason 1\nCritics received the first three episodes of Bloodline for initial review, and reception was positive—the season received a score of 75 out of 100 based on 31 reviews on Metacritic. Rotten Tomatoes gave the season an approval rating of 81%, with an average rating of 7/10 based on 48 reviews, and a critical consensus of: \"While Bloodline's tricky timeline detracts from the potency of the story and its characters, the show remains an addictive, tightly drawn brainteaser framed on a believable canvas.\"\nSeveral critics gave especially positive reviews. Ken Tucker of Yahoo! TV called it a \"twisty mood piece ... well worth your time\". Dorothy Rabinowitz, writing for The Wall Street Journal, said the series possesses a \"magnetic pull\". David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter raved, \"Chalk up another forceful punch [for Netflix] with Bloodline, a riveting, superbly cast slow-burn family drama set between the oceanfront paradise and the murky mangrove swamps of the Florida Keys.\" Other strong reviews came from The A.V. Club, the Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, The Philadelphia Inquirer, Variety, Entertainment Weekly, and the San Francisco Chronicle. Cinema Blend, Decider, Badass Digest, and Forbes have hailed Bloodline as the best Netflix original to date.\nDebate ensued among some critics who felt the three episodes Netflix provided for review were insufficient. As Hank Stuever wrote in his review for The Washington Post, \"I've enjoyed Bloodline so far, but it's impossible to say if it's consistently this good, because Netflix would share only three episodes (out of 13) with critics.\"  For HitFix, Alan Sepinwall (who awarded the three episodes a B−) echoed the sentiment, saying, \"We'll see if they play those [time-shifting] games to this extent with Bloodline — Todd Kessler has suggested to at least one reporter that the flash-forwards won't be a series-long (or even season-long) device — but for now, the new show seems more style over substance.\" He later revised his opinion on the matter, writing that Bloodline ultimately \"played fair\" with its narrative. He summed up his thoughts on the season: \"In the end, Mendelsohn was so great that I'm glad I made it to the end, but this one feels better-suited to the anthology miniseries model than as an ongoing.\"\nOther mixed reviews came from James Poniewozik of Time, Robert Bianco of USA Today and Margaret Lyons of Vulture. However, Sean Fitz-Gerald, who reviewed the season as a whole for Vulture, wrote in sum: \"Bloodline was a gripping, slow burn of a journey, so stressful, engaging, and uncomfortable ... KZK did a fantastic job crafting something real enough to find introspective truth in.\"\nThe Playlist named Bloodline the normative successor to Breaking Bad because of its complex and tragic anti-hero narrative. Critic Nikola Grozdavonic said of Bloodline's neo-noir mystery: \"As TV shows continue to soar during this golden age of television, the bar keeps rising higher and higher ... Right now [Bloodline is] the greatest example of how profoundly effective the 13-episode format can be in modern storytelling. Of course, shows have to be technically sound in order to represent their story in the greatest possible light, and the team behind Bloodline does an outstanding job in every technical department. Breathtaking cinematography, an immersive soundtrack, and a coyly observant camera all enhancing the viewing experience by a noticeable degree. The picturesque location of the Florida Keys, divided between gorgeous coral reefs and dark mangroves, is captured with an eye for the sensual and the symbolic. And yet, all of this would turn to dust if the story didn't reach as deep as it does, and the writing and performances weren't as spectacular as they are.\" IndieWire asserted that Bloodline's mix of noir and family drama allows it to successfully confront complex familial dynamics. According to author David Canfield, \"The opening minutes of Bloodline rather perfectly ascertain a new trend happening in dramatic television right now: the family noir ... The conceit of these new series is to realize what's common to family-centric fiction within a construct that is both unsettling and pessimistic ... Bloodline identifies the origins of familial roles, each shaped by a cataclysmic event in the Rayburn siblings' childhood. The time-shifting is intrinsic to the show's ideas, exploring the formation of identity through flashbacks and, via glimpses of the future, affirming their inflexibility.\"\nCritics' reactions were more divided to Bloodline in its entirety, with end-of-season reviews from publications, such Vox.com, IGN, and Uncle Barky, ending up very favorable, while reviews from HitFix, and Vulture were more mixed.\nThe first season was named among the best of 2015 by Rolling Stone, The Star-Ledger, Vanity Fair, The Guardian, IGN, The A.V. Club, The Week, Maxim and The Hollywood Reporter. However, IndieWire named the show one of the most disappointing TV shows of 2015.\n\nSeason 2\nSeason 2 of Bloodline received mixed reviews from critics, with many reviewers criticizing the pacing, but praising the performances and cinematography. On Metacritic, the season has a score of 60 out of 100, based on 9 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 53% approval rating, based on 19 reviews, with a rating average of 6.1/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Despite impressive performances and attractive cinematography, Bloodline's second season fails to recapture its predecessor's dramatic intrigue.\"\n\nSeason 3\nThe third and final season received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the season holds an approval rating of 53% and an average score of 6.1/10 based on 17 reviews. The critics' consensus: \"Muddled and unsatisfying, Bloodline's final season offers disappointing proof that a stellar cast can only carry a series for so long.\"\n\nAccolades\nCommercial\nThe official trailer was released in mid-February, containing the Lissie cover of Metallica's song \"Nothing Else Matters\". After the trailer's release, Bloodline ranked eighth among all cable/streaming programs in Digital Audience Ratings and was the top trending program, despite being a month out of its premiere. According to Variety, \"The first full trailer release for [Netflix's] upcoming drama 'Bloodline' ... already has nearly 1 million more views in just a week's time, landing the show on the Cable/Streaming and Trending leaderboards this week.\"\n\nHome media\nBloodline has been released on DVD in Australia; season 1 on May 5, 2016, season 2 on May 31, 2017; and season 3 on July 4, 2018. The first season has also been released on DVD and Blu-ray in Europe in March 2016.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nBloodline at IMDb",

    "title": "Son-Rise",
    "text": "Son-Rise is a home-based program for children and adults with autism spectrum disorders and other developmental disabilities, which was developed by former advertising executive Barry Neil Kaufman and his wife, Samahria Lyte Kaufman, for their son Raun, who was diagnosed with autism and who they claimed to have fully recovered from his condition. The program is described by Autism Speaks as a \"child-centered program that places parents as the key therapists and directors of their program\".\nParents are trained at the Kaufman's Autism Treatment Center of America, the division of The Option Institute in Sheffield, Massachusetts that teaches The Son-Rise Program. There, the Kaufman family and their fellow staff members teach families and professionals how to be aware of their attitudes—a core principle of the therapy—for bonding and relationship building, as well as creating a low-stimulus, distraction-free playroom, so the autistic child can feel secure and in control of the over-stimulation. Parents and facilitators imitate an autistic person's exclusive and restricted stimming behavior until the autistic person shows social cues for willing engagement. Then encouragement for more complex social activities is done in a non-coercive way. If the autistic person moves away from social interaction, the facilitator gives the autistic person their space by using parallel play to gain the child's or the adult's trust. To encourage skill acquisition, the program uses the autistic person's particular motivation for learning.\nThe program's developers claim that if the parents learn to accept their loved one without judgement they will teach themselves to interact with others, and that this will allow them to engage in social interaction because they chose to learn the skills. A 2003 study found that involvement with the program led to more drawbacks than benefits for the involved families over time, though there was a strong correlation between patterns of intervention implementation and parental perceptions of intervention efficacy. A 2006 study found that the program is not always implemented as it is described in the literature, which means it will be difficult to evaluate its success and failure rate.\n\nHistory\nIn the 1970s, Barry and Samahria Kaufman created the treatment modality for their son, Raun, who had been diagnosed with severe autism. However, it remains unclear if Raun Kaufman had ever been autistic. Among the five clinics who evaluated the boy in New York State—each describing him as \"socially withdrawn and uncommunicative\", it was only the sixth clinic that felt he was autistic.\nIn 1976, Barry Neil Kaufman published Son-Rise, a book recounting his son's claimed recovery, which he self published in 1995 with the title Son-Rise: The Miracle Continues. The book was adapted into a televised docudrama film, called Son-Rise: A Miracle of Love and aired on NBC in 1979.\nToday, Raun Kaufman serves as the Director of Global Education for the Autism Treatment Center of America.  \nA 1997 BBC documentary followed the family of a five-year-old autistic boy treated by the program.\n\nEffectiveness\nThere are no documented normalizations with older children, and it may be that success \"depends on a certain level of intellectual potential\". Some professionals have questioned the emphasis placed on eye contact and its potential problems for some children. The consensus within the medical community is that there is no cure for autism and only a very few treatments have empirical evidence for improvements in symptoms.\nA 2003 study found that involvement with The Son-Rise Program led to more drawbacks than benefits for the involved families over time, although family stress levels did not rise in all cases. A 2006 study found that The Son-Rise Program is not always implemented as it is typically described in the literature, which suggests it will be difficult to evaluate its efficacy.\nIn 2009, United Kingdom’s Advertising Standards Authority sanctioned The Option Institute for a misleading ad claiming Son-Rise as an autism cure. As of 2017, there was little evidence supporting the program.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nAutism Treatment Center of America",

    "title": "Imago camera",
    "text": "Imago (stylised as IMAGO) is an analog, walk-in, large format photo camera. It creates life-size self-portraits of people on 62 × 200 cm photographic paper via direct exposure. Since a negative is not created, every image is unique and cannot be reprinted. The images are colloquially referred to as \"Imago-grams.\" The only existing camera was built in the 1970s by German physicist Werner Kraus and artist Erhard Hößle. It is based on an optical system invented by Kraus for scientific purposes.\nThe camera was in museum storage from 1976 to 2006, when it was rediscovered and rebuilt by the inventor's daughter, artist Susanna Kraus.\n\nHistory\nIn 1970, physicist Werner Kraus was commissioned to photographically document the Daimler-Benz Wankel engine’s combustion cycle. For this purpose, he invented a  photo-optical system which captured images on a 1:1 scale. Later, based on the same system,  Kraus, together with the artist and sculptor Erhard Hößle, built the Imago Camera. The camera and its photographs were exhibited in Munich during the Fluxus-movement. It operated for several years, but was archived in 1978 due to cessation of production of the photographic paper, which was essential for its operation. It was later stored in the archive of the Pinakothek der Moderne museum in Munich.\n\nRestoration\nIn 2005, photographs taken by the camera were rediscovered by Kraus' daughter, Susanna Kraus, which renewed her interest in Imago, and prompted her to restore it. During the following year, Susanna Kraus searched for a manufacturer who would produce the necessary photographic paper. When she convinced Ilford Switzerland in 2006 to develop and start the production of the direct positive paper, the curator of the New Collection of the Pinakothek der Moderne museum Florian Hufnagl agreed to release the camera from the archive and return it to the inventor's daughter. At the end of 2006, the first exhibition of the photos made with the restored Imago Camera was held in Vienna. After several years of travelling and exhibitions, in 2011, the camera inhabited a new photo studio started by Susanna Kraus in the Aufbau Haus on Moritzplatz, Berlin Kreuzberg. It has been operating at this location since.\n\nCharacteristics\nImago is a large format camera measuring 6.85 × 3.9 × 3.55 meters. It is designed to capture life-size analog images of subjects inside it. The camera is equipped with an optical system, specifically constructed for it, with an extremely high focal length allowing pictures to be taken on a 1:1 scale, without warping. The camera features a special internal setting of six strobe lights providing a high intensity light necessary for production of the large direct exposure images on paper, which is considerably less photosensitive than film. The Camera produces 62 × 200 cm sized black and white prints on Imago and Harman Direct Positive Paper. Inside the camera, one can see a true-sided reflection of oneself in a special mirror, serving as a viewfinder. The picture is taken by the subject releasing a trigger.\n\nImago photographic paper\nImago Camera uses silver gelatin direct positive photographic paper developed in cooperation with Ilford Switzerland and HARMAN Technology specially for Imago. It is made for direct exposure and reacts as soon as an image is exposed onto it. The exposed paper is developed in a conventional black and white process taking ten minutes, after which the print is ready. The resulting images are characterized by high contrast and display a wide range of tones.\n\nFurther developments\nIn 2014 the Imago technology was redeveloped and wrapped in a new design shell. Built by Jakob Kraus, the new aluminum camera was called the Imago Photour and was designed to be mobile. Transported in a 40-foot container, it can be reassembled at a new location within two days. The new camera's first destinations were Rotterdam and Shanghai, where the first Imago Photour exhibitions were held in 2014 to 2015.\n\nNotable people who have made self-portraits with Imago\nNick Cave, Robert Wilson, Eva Mattes, Jonathan Meese, Anton Corbijn, Mike Leigh, François Ozon, Barbara Sukowa, Ernst Fuchs, Donata and Wim Wenders, Tim Raue, Angela Winkler, Maria Schrader, F.

    "text": "The Kejaman people, also known as Kajaman, are an indigenous ethnic group classified under the Orang Ulu of Sarawak, Malaysia. They are part of the Kajang ethnolinguistic cluster, which also includes the Punan, Sekapan, Lahanan and Sihan sub-groups. \nPredominantly residing in the Belaga District along the upper Rajang River, their settlements remain relatively isolated, allowing them to preserve their distinct cultural traditions and way of life. Despite their small population, the Kejaman maintain a strong sense of identity through oral traditions, longhouse communal living and participation in broader Kajang cultural practices.\n\nHistory\nThe Kejaman are classified as a sub-group within the Kajang ethnolinguistic cluster, which also includes the Punan, Sekapan, Lahanan and Sihan sub-groups. This classification is based on linguistic similarities and shared historical origins. The Kajang peoples, including the Kejaman, have distinct languages and cultural practices, yet they maintain common ancestral narratives and kinship structures.\nHistorically, the Kejaman people have established settlements in two principal villages, Long Segaham and Long Litten. These settlements were formed in response to inter-ethnic conflicts in the 18th century, which prompted migration and subsequent relocation. Despite their relatively small numbers, the Kejaman have preserved their cultural heritage through oral traditions and longhouse communal living arrangements. \nTheir geographical location presents both advantages and challenges. While it has helped maintain cultural traditions, access to services such as education and healthcare can be limited due to transportation constraints. Travel options mainly consist of four-wheel-drive vehicles and longboats from Bintulu or express boats from Sibu to Bakun. This restricted connectivity has played a significant role in preserving their traditional lifestyle while simultaneously hindering opportunities for economic advancement.\n\nCulture\nThe Saviek Festival, held in Umah Kejaman Lasah, Long Segaham, is a significant cultural event for the Kejaman people. It brings together the Kajang community to celebrate and promote traditional customs such as merarau, ngajat ngelezyeang bavui and mejung jejang. Traditionally observed after the harvest season, the festival is also celebrated by the Punan, Sekapan and Lahanan communities. It serves as a platform for preserving cultural heritage, strengthening communal ties and showcasing indigenous traditions to a broader audience.\nEfforts to document and preserve Kejaman heritage have also extended to linguistic research. In 2019, Dr. Amee Joan of Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS) published the first Kejaman language dictionary, following four years of research on the community. Her study revealed linguistic similarities between Kejaman and Melanau, while also documenting cultural influences from neighboring indigenous groups such as the Iban, Sekapan and Lahanan. The dictionary serves as an important resource for the preservation of the Kejaman language, particularly as intermarriage and migration contribute to language shift among younger generations.\n\nSee also\nDemographics of Sarawak\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "1938 Walsall by-election",
    "text": "The 1938 Walsall by-election was a parliamentary by-election held for the British House of Commons constituency of Walsall on 16 November 1938. The by-election was caused by the death of the sitting Liberal National Member of Parliament, Joseph Leckie. The election was won by George Schuster, a fellow Liberal National.\n\nCandidates\nLiberal National\nThe Liberal Nationals selected Sir George Schuster. Schuster was something of a renaissance man. He had qualified as a barrister and had already had successful careers in business, colonial government, and economics. He came from a wealthy family with banking and cotton interests.  As a representative of the National Government  Schuster was not opposed by the Conservatives, although they were apparently disappointed the Liberal Nationals exercised their right to find their own successor to Leckie and did not cede the National nomination to the local Conservatives. Schuster later went on to spend 22 years on Oxfordshire County Council and achieve success in the field of further education as Chairman of the Board of Governors of Atlantic College from 1963-1973. He died in 1982 aged 101 years.\n\nLabour\nSchuster was therefore opposed only by the Labour Party candidate, George Jeger, a journalist from London and a local councillor in Shoreditch, of which he was mayor in 1938. Jeger had been Labour candidate in Bethnal Green South West at the 1935 general election. He went on to represent Winchester (1945–1950) and Goole (1950–1971) in Parliament.\n\nIssues\nAs the National candidate, Schuster sought to defend the record of the National Government and in particular the foreign policy associated with Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. The great issue of the day was the worsening of international relations with the rise of Adolf Hitler in Germany, Benito Mussolini in Italy and Japanese expansionism in the Far East. Chamberlain’s policy of appeasing these dissatisfied powers, in the immediate glow of what was thought to be Chamberlain’s success in getting the Munich Agreement signed at the end of September,  was the one that Schuster, and those in the government supporting him, chose to emphasise. He also attacked the Labour Party for its support of economic planning and state regulation at the expense of small business and local enterprise and for its allegation that the government planned further cuts in social welfare provision. However, the main issue was for the electors of Walsall to show their approval or rejection of the Munich Agreement.\nFor Labour, George Jeger attacked the government’s record on international and domestic policy. He was reported in the local press as saying that the National Government was not firm enough in its stand for peace and had failed the League of Nations but he also criticised the government’s re-armament policy as taking funds away from essential social services. Jeger attacked Chamberlain’s efforts at Munich saying that forcing Czechoslovakia to hand over the Sudetenland merely encouraged further aggression by Hitler and sacrificed a democratic country in the face of Nazi blackmail. The Times headline over its by-election coverage of 14 November summed it up –‘Walsall Contest – Foreign Policy the Main Issue'.\n\nResult\nThe National Liberal Party held the seat.\n\nReferences\nSee also\nList of United Kingdom by-elections\nUnited Kingdom by-election records",

    "title": "Sense and Sensibility",
    "text": "Sense and Sensibility (working title: Elinor and Marianne) is the first published novel by the English author Jane Austen, appearing in 1811. It was published anonymously: By A Lady appears on the title page where the author's name might have been.\nThe novel is probably set between 1792 and 1797 and follows the three Dashwood sisters and their widowed mother as they are forced to leave the family estate in Sussex and move to a modest cottage on the property of a distant relative in Devon. There the two eldest girls experience love and heartbreak that tries the contrasting characters of both.\n\nPlot summary\nOn his deathbed, Henry Dashwood makes his son, John, promise to provide for his stepmother and half-sisters, Elinor, Marianne and Margaret, from his inheritance. John's wife Fanny instead persuades him not to support them financially, leaving them a greatly reduced income.\nFanny's brother Edward Ferrars arrives for a visit. When he and Elinor seem to be growing close, Fanny warns Mrs Dashwood that their mother has higher goals for Edward. Affronted, Mrs Dashwood moves her family to Barton Cottage in Devonshire, which her second cousin, Sir John Middleton, offered for a low rent. Later, while dining with the Middletons at Barton Park, family friend Colonel Brandon is attracted to Marianne. However, he is aged thirty-five, which seems too old to sixteen-year-old Marianne's romantic sensibilities.\nWhile out walking, Marianne sprains her ankle. John Willoughby happens upon her and carries Marianne home. During subsequent visits, their similar artistic taste causes Marianne to fall in love with him, abandoning caution and propriety. Just as an engagement seems imminent, Willoughby informs the Dashwoods that his elderly cousin Mrs Smith, whom he is financially dependent upon due to his debts, is sending him to London indefinitely on business. Marianne is left distraught.\nWhen Edward Ferrars visits Barton Cottage, he seems subdued. Shortly afterwards, sisters Anne and Lucy Steele, vulgar cousins of Sir John's mother-in-law, Mrs Jennings, stay at Barton Park. While there, Lucy confides to Elinor that she and Edward are secretly engaged, giving Elinor an insight into Lucy's jealous and calculating nature.\nMrs Jennings invites the elder Dashwood sisters to visit her in London. After Marianne's letters to Willoughby go unanswered, they unexpectedly meet at a ball. Willoughby, there with another woman, greets Marianne coldly, later informing her he is betrothed to the rich Miss Grey. Marianne is heartbroken but tells Elinor that she and Willoughby never were engaged.\nColonel Brandon reveals to Elinor that Willoughby had earlier seduced and abandoned Brandon's teenaged ward, Eliza Williams. Willoughby's cousin has consequently disinherited him, which explains his need to marry an heiress. Meanwhile, the Steele sisters come to London and are invited to stay at John and Fanny Dashwood's London house in preference to Elinor and Marianne. Based on their cordiality, Anne mistakenly believes that the Ferrars have become fond enough of Lucy to welcome her into the family and reveals Lucy's engagement to Edward. As a result, the sisters are dismissed from the house, and Edward's wealthy mother orders him to break off the engagement. When Edward refuses, he is disinherited in favour of his younger brother. On learning this, Colonel Brandon shows his admiration for Edward's honourable conduct by offering him the nearby parsonage, allowing him and Lucy to marry after he is ordained.\nMrs Jennings takes the Dashwood sisters to visit her second daughter as they journey back to Devonshire. Marianne goes walking in the rain and contracts putrid fever. When Marianne's condition worsens, Elinor writes home. Colonel Brandon, who lives nearby, volunteers to bring Marianne's mother. That night, Willoughby arrives. He tells Elinor that he genuinely loved Marianne. However, the callous way he talks about Eliza and his wife lessens Elinor's pity for him.\nMarianne recovers, and learning of Elinor's own silent heartache, is ashamed of her ostentatious grief, and vows to be guided by her sister's good sense and amend her future behaviour.\nAfter their return home, a family servant happens to encounter Lucy at a nearby market town and brings back news that she is now Mrs Ferrars. This final act of spite becomes obvious when Edward arrives to reveal that Lucy had jilted him and married his now wealthy younger brother. After being ordained, Edward marries Elinor, while Marianne later marries Colonel Brandon. The two sisters can now harmoniously live as neighbours.\n\nComposition\nJane Austen wrote the first draft of the novel in epistolary form, possibly as early as 1795, when she was around 19 years old, or in 1797 at the age of 21. She reportedly gave it the working title Elinor and Marianne, reflecting the focus on the contrasting personalities of the two eldest Dashwood sisters. This early version of the story was written in letters, a common narrative style of the period, which allowed for intimate insight into the characters' thoughts and feelings. Austen later revised the novel, changing it from an epistolary format to a continuous narrative and retitling it Sense and Sensibility, thereby enabling a more flexible and expansive exploration of the story’s themes and social commentary.\nAusten drew inspiration from contemporary novels of the late 18th century that explored similar themes of romance, morality, and social conduct. Adam Stevenson's Life and Love (1785), which recounts personal romantic experiences and societal expectations, is thought to have influenced Austen's depiction of complex emotional relationships and the challenges of constrained social circumstances. Jane West's A Gossip's Story (1796) is also considered a significant influence, as it features one sister characterized by rational sense and another by passionate, emotive sensibility. Notably, West's romantic sister shares the name Marianne with Austen's character, and modern editions of West's novel highlight textual and thematic similarities, suggesting that Austen may have consciously or unconsciously drawn on these elements in shaping her own characters and plot.\nAusten may also have drawn on historical figures in developing certain characters. In particular, Warren Hastings, the first Governor-General of India, is often cited as a potential inspiration for Colonel Brandon. Parallels include rumored illegitimate daughters—Hastings with his possible daughter Eliza de Feuillide, and Brandon with Eliza Brandon in the novel—as well as early departures to India at age seventeen. Both figures are also associated with dueling and matters of honor, characteristics echoed in Colonel Brandon’s backstory. Literary scholar Linda Robinson Walker has argued that Hastings “haunts Sense and Sensibility in the character of Colonel Brandon,” noting that Austen may have drawn on her knowledge of contemporary political figures and family connections to lend historical depth and realism to her fictional characters.\n\nCritical views\n19th-century responses\nEarly reviews of Sense and Sensibility focused on the novel as providing lessons in conduct (which would be debated by later critics), as well as reviewing the characters. The Norton Critical Edition of Sense and Sensibility contains a number of such responses in its supplementary material. An \"Unsigned Review\" in the February 1812 Critical Review praises the novel as well-written and realistic, with well-drawn characters and a \"highly pleasing\" plot in which \"the whole is just long enough to interest the reader without fatiguing\". Elinor and her mother are praised, while Marianne's extreme sensibility is seen as bringing unhappiness on herself.\nAnother \"Unsigned Review\" from the May 1812 British Critic further emphasises the novel's function as a type of conduct book. In this author's opinion, Austen's favouring of Elinor's temperament over Marianne's provides the lesson. The reviewer claims that \"the object of the work is to represent the effects on the conduct of life, of discreet quiet good sense on the one hand, and an overrefined and excessive susceptibility on the other.\" He goes on to state that the book contains \"many sober and salutary maxims for the conduct of life\" within a \"very pleasing and entertaining narrative.\"\nW. F. Pollock's 1861 article for Frasier's Magazine, on \"British Novelists\" is described as an \"early example of what would become the customary view of Sense and Sensibility.\" In addition to emphasising the novel's morality, Pollock reviews the characters in catalogue-like fashion, allotting praise and criticism on the assumption that Austen favours Elinor's point of view and temperament and extending it to the minor characters. Mrs Palmer is silly, Sir John Dashwood is selfish, the behaviour of the Steele sisters is vulgar. However, an anonymous piece titled \"Miss Austen\" published in 1866 in The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine departs from other early criticism in sympathising with Marianne over Elinor, claiming that Elinor is \"too good\" a character. The article also differs from other reviews in its claim that the \"prevailing merit\" of the book is not in its sketch of the two sisters; rather, the book is effective because of its \"excellent treatment of the subordinate characters.\" Alice Meynell's 1894 article \"The Classic Novelist\" in the Pall Mall Gazette also concurs with Austen's attention to small things and minor characters and small matters since \"that which makes life, art, and work trivial is a triviality of relations.\" Also discussed is the children's function in highlighting \"the folly of their mothers\", especially in Lady Middleton's case.\n\nCharacterisation\nAs used by Austen, the word \"sense\" signifies good judgment, wisdom, or prudence, and \"sensibility\" signifies sensitivity, sympathy, or emotionality. By changing the title from the names of the sisters Elinor and Marianne in her first choice of title to that of their qualities, Austen adds \"philosophical depth\" to what began as a sketch of two characters. However, these characteristics, as demonstrated through the dominant behaviour of the sisters, are not mutually exclusive. Although their qualities are compared and contrasted through means of the plot, neither sister is a one-sided caricature. Humanised through emotional suffering, Marianne's sympathy for her sister teaches her self-control and prudence, while Elinor learns to express her emotions more overtly.\nNevertheless, the changes to the original novel's structure are never resolved in the eyes of some critics. A. Walton Litz judged that Sense and Sensibility is \"caught uneasily between burlesque and the serious novel...in which the crude antitheses of the original structure were never successfully overcome\". Tony Tanner sees a shift of view instead to \"the tensions between the potential instability of the individual and the required stabilities of society\", as demonstrated by the influence of the governing qualities on the younger and the older sister. While sensibility has its positive aspects, its over-cultivation leads in the novel to the psychosomatic disorders to which Marianne nearly succumbs.\nClaire Tomalin too argues that Sense and Sensibility has a \"wobble in its approach\", which developed because Austen, in the course of writing the novel, gradually became less certain about whether sense or sensibility should triumph. Austen characterises Marianne as a sweet person with attractive qualities: intelligence, musical talent, frankness, and the capacity to love deeply. She also acknowledges that Willoughby, with all his faults, continues to love and, in some measure, appreciate Marianne. For these reasons, some readers find Marianne's ultimate marriage to Colonel Brandon an unsatisfactory ending.\nIn Rachel Brownstein's opinion, the differences between the Dashwood sisters have been exaggerated, and in fact the sisters are more alike than they are different, with Elinor having an \"excellent heart\" and being capable of the same romantic passions as Marianne feels, while Marianne has much sense as well. Elinor is more reserved, more polite, and less impulsive than Marianne, who loves poetry, taking walks across picturesque landscapes and believes in intense romantic relationships, but it is this very closeness between the sisters that allows these differences to emerge during their exchanges.\nMary Favret explores the contrast through examining popular forms of fiction of the time. In epistolary fiction, action, dialogue, and character interactions are all reflected through letters sent from one or more of the characters. In exploring Austen's fraught relationship with such fiction, Favret surveys how Austen \"wrestled with epistolary form\" in previous writings and, with the publication of Sense and Sensibility, \"announced her victory over the constraints of the letter\". Favret contends that Austen's version of the letter separates her from her \"admired predecessor, Samuel Richardson\" in that Austen's letters are \"a misleading guide to the human heart which, in the best instances, is always changing and adapting.\" According to Favret, the character of Elinor Dashwood is an \"anti-epistolary heroine\" whose \"inner world\" of thoughts and feelings does not find \"direct expression in the novel, although her point of view controls the story.\" Sense and Sensibility establishes what Favret calls a \"new privacy\" in the novel, which was constrained by previous notions of the romance of letters. This new privacy is a \"less constraining mode of narration\" in which Austen's narrator provides commentary on the action, rather than the characters themselves through the letters. Favret claims that in Sense and Sensibility, Austen wants to \"recontextualize\" the letter and bring it into a \"new realism.\" Austen does so by imbuing the letter with dangerous power when Marianne writes to Willoughby; both their love and the letter \"prove false\". Additionally, Favret claims that Austen uses the correspondence of both of the sisters to emphasise the contrasts in their personalities. When both write letters upon arriving in London, Elinor's letter is the \"dutiful letter of the 'sensible sister'\" and Marianne writes a \"vaguely illicit letter\" reflecting her characterisation as the \"sensitive\" sister\". What is perhaps most striking about Favret's analysis is that she notes that the lovers who write to one another never unite with each other.\n\nSocietal themes\nA common theme of Austen criticism has been on the legal aspects of society and the family, particularly wills, the rights of first and second sons, and lines of inheritance. Gene Ruoff's book Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility explores these issues in an extended discussion of the novel. The first two chapters deal extensively with the subject of wills and the discourse of inheritance. These topics reveal what Ruoff calls \"the cultural fixation on priority of male birth\". According to Ruoff, male birth is by far the dominant issue in these legal conversations. Ruoff observes that, within the linear family, the order of male birth decides issues of eligibility and merit. When Robert Ferrars becomes his mother's heir, Edward is no longer appealing to his \"opportunistic\" fiancée Lucy, who quickly turns her attention to the foppish Robert and \"entraps him\" in order to secure the inheritance for herself. Ruoff comments that Lucy is specifically aiming for the heir because of the monetary advantage. William Galperin, in his book The History Austen, comments on the tendency of this system of patriarchal inheritance and earning as working to ensure the vulnerability of women. Because of this vulnerability, Galperin contends that Sense and Sensibility shows marriage as the only practical solution \"against the insecurity of remaining an unmarried woman.\"\nFeminist critics have long been engaged in conversations about Jane Austen, and Sense and Sensibility has figured in these discussions, especially in the context of the patriarchal system of inheritance and earning. Sandra M. Gilbert and Susan Gubar's seminal feminist work The Madwoman in the Attic: The Woman Writer and the Nineteenth-Century Imagination contains several discussions of this novel. The authors read the beginning of Sense and Sensibility as a retelling of King Lear from a female perspective and contend that these \"reversals imply that male traditions need to be evaluated and reinterpreted from a female perspective.\" Gilbert and Gubar argue that Austen explores the effects of patriarchal control on women, particularly in the spheres of employment and inheritance. In Sense and Sensibility they educe the fact that Mr. John Dashwood cuts off his stepmother and half sisters from their home as well as promised income, as an instance of these effects. They also point to the \"despised\" Mrs. Ferrars's tampering with the patriarchal line of inheritance in her disowning of her elder son, Edward Ferrars, as proof that this construction is ultimately arbitrary. Gilbert and Gubar contend that while Sense and Sensibility's ultimate message is that \"young women like Marianne and Elinor must submit to powerful conventions of society by finding a male protector\", women such as Mrs. Ferrars and Lucy Steele demonstrate how women can \"themselves become agents of repression, manipulators of conventions, and survivors.\" In order to protect themselves and their own interests, Mrs. Ferrars and Lucy Steele must participate in the same patriarchal system that oppresses them.\nIn the chapter \"Sense and Sensibility: Opinions Too Common and Too Dangerous\", from her book Jane Austen: Women, Politics, and the Novel, Claudia Johnson also gives a feminist reading of Sense and Sensibility. She differs from previous critics, especially the earliest ones, in her contention that Sense and Sensibility is not, as it is often assumed to be, a \"dramatized conduct book\" that values \"female prudence\" (associated with Elinor's sense) over \"female impetuosity\" (associated with Marianne's sensibility). Rather, Johnson sees Sense and Sensibility as a \"dark and disenchanted novel\" that views \"institutions of order\" such as property, marriage, and family in a negative light, an attitude that makes the novel the \"most attuned to social criticism\" of Austen's works. According to Johnson, Sense and Sensibility critically examines the codes of propriety as well as their enforcement by the community. Key to Austen's criticism of society, runs Johnson's argument, is the depiction of the unfair marginalisation of women resulting from the \"death or simple absence of male protectors.\" Additionally, the male characters in Sense and Sensibility are depicted unfavourably. Johnson calls the gentlemen in Sense and Sensibility \"uncommitted sorts\" who \"move on, more or less unencumbered by human wreckage from the past.\" Johnson compares Edward to Willoughby in this regard, claiming that all of the differences between them as individuals do not hide the fact that their failures are actually identical; Johnson calls them both \"weak, duplicitous, and selfish,\" lacking the honesty and forthrightness with which Austen endows other \"exemplary gentlemen\" in her work.\nMary Poovey's analysis in The Proper Lady and the Woman Writer: Ideology as Style in the Works of Mary Wollstonecraft, Mary Shelley and Jane Austen concurs with Johnson's on the dark tone of Sense and Sensibility. Poovey contends that Sense and Sensibility has a \"somber tone\" in which conflict breaks out between Austen's engagement with her \"self-assertive characters\" and the moral codes necessary to control their potentially \"anarchic\" desires. Austen shows, according to Poovey, this conflict between individual desire and the restraint of moral principles through the character of Elinor herself. Except for Elinor, all of the female characters in Sense and Sensibility experience some kind of female excess. Poovey argues that while Austen does recognise \"the limitations of social institutions\", she demonstrates the necessity of controlling the \"dangerous excesses of female feeling\" rather than liberating them. She does so by demonstrating that Elinor's self-denial, especially in her keeping of Lucy Steele's secret and willingness to help Edward, even though both of these actions were hurtful to her, ultimately contribute to her own contentment and that of others. In this way, Poovey contends that Austen suggests that the submission to society that Elinor demonstrates is the proper way to achieve happiness in life.\n\nHarmony with the environment\nThe new discipline of Ecocriticism extends the examination of imbalance in Austen's novels and finds that she \"antedated Victorian novelists in predicting early signs of environmental manipulation and identifying the attitudes and practices that led to the ecological collapse of early nineteenth century England\". Susan Rowland's article \"The 'Real Work': Ecocritical Alchemy and Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility\" studies the effects of alienation upon Edward Ferrars and Marianne Dashwood. Edward feels out of place in society because he lacks what Rowland calls \"useful employment\". His condition underlines the historical problem of labour in Western industrialised societies. Edward's alienation also represents \"the progressive estrangement from nonhuman nature\" in modern society as a whole, only resolved in his case by becoming a \"pastor\". Rowland argues that human culture estranges people from nature rather than returning them to it, serving merely through the fact of ownership to bolster their place in the social order. Marianne's emotional estrangement begins as she is ripped from the aesthetic enjoyment of her home environment, although ultimately she finds a new identity by uniting with Colonel Brandon on his estate at Delaford.\n\nPublication history\nIn 1811, Thomas Egerton of the Military Library publishing house in London accepted the manuscript for publication in three volumes. Austen paid to have the book published and paid the publisher a commission on sales. The cost of publication was more than a third of Austen's annual household income of £460 (about £15,000 in 2008 currency). She made a profit of £140 (almost £5,000 in 2008 currency) on the first edition, which sold all 750 printed copies by July 1813. A second edition was advertised in October 1813.\nSense and Sensibility was the first Austen title to be republished in England after her death, and the first illustrated Austen book produced in Britain, in Richard Bentley's Standard Novels series of 1833. The novel has been in continuous publication since 1811, and has many times been illustrated, excerpted, abridged, and adapted for stage, film, and television.\nThe novel was soon translated into French by Madame Isabelle de Montolieu as Raison et Sensibilité, ou les deux manières d'aimer (1815). Montolieu had only the most basic knowledge of English, and her translations were more \"imitations\" of Austen's novels as Montolieu had her assistants provide a summary of Austen's novels, which she then translated into an embellished French that often radically altered Austen's plots and characters. The \"translation\" of Sense and Sensibility by Montolieu changes entire scenes and characters, for example having Marianne call Willoughby an \"angel\" and an \"Adonis\" upon first meeting him, lines that are not in the English original. Likewise, the scene where Mrs Dashwood criticises her husband for planning to subsidise his widowed stepmother because it might be disadvantageous to \"our little Harry\", Mrs Dashwood soon forgets about Harry and it is made apparent her objections are founded in greed; Montolieu altered the scene by having Mrs Dashwood continuing to speak of \"our little Harry\" as the basis of her objections, completely changing her motives. When Elinor learns the Ferrars who married Lucy Steele is Robert, not Edward, Montolieu adds a scene, in which Edward, the Dashwood sisters and their mother all break down in tears while clasping hands, that was not in the original. Austen has the marriage of Robert Ferrars and Lucy Steele end well while Montolieu changes the marriage into a failure.\n\nAdaptations\nScreen\n1971: An adaptation for BBC television was dramatized by Denis Constanduros and directed by David Giles.\n1981: A seven-episode TV series was directed by Rodney Bennett.\n1995: A theatrical release was adapted by Emma Thompson and directed by Ang Lee.\n2000: A Tamil adaptation titled Kandukondain Kandukondain, directed by Rajiv Menon.\n2008: A three-episode BBC TV series was adapted by Andrew Davies and directed by John Alexander.\n2014: Kumkum Bhagya, an Indian Hindi soap opera on Zee TV, was \"loosely based\" on the novel.\n2017: Kasthooriman, an Indian Malayalam soap opera on Asianet, was a loose adaptation of the novel.\n2024: Sense and Sensibility, an adaptation from Hallmark Channel in the United States.

    "text": "Denmark–Eritrea relations refers to the current and historical relations between Denmark and Eritrea. Denmark is represented in Eritrea through its embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, and Eritrea is represented in Denmark through its embassy in Stockholm, Sweden. \nDiplomatic relations were established in 1993 and suffered a setback after Denmark decided to suspend development cooperation with Eritrea in January 2002 and close its embassy in June 2002. After the Eritrean–Ethiopian War from 1998 to 2000, Denmark sent 320 soldiers to the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea to monitor a ceasefire in the border war.\n\nHistory\nIn 1950, Denmark and 15 other countries voted for a united Eritrea and Ethiopia under Haile Selassie in the United Nations. During the Eritrean War of Independence, Denmark sent humanitarian assistance to the Eritrean People's Liberation Front. In the 1980s, the parliament of Denmark passed a resolution supporting the independence in Eritrea. Denmark opened an embassy in Asmara in July 1997, but closed it in June 2002, because of the lack of democracy in the country. In October 2001, Eritrea expelled the Italian ambassador, and later Denmark recalled its ambassador to Eritrea for consultations. In 2001, Denmark ended aid to Eritrea because of the arrest of Eritrean students and opposition politicians by President Isaias Afewerki, and the lack of freedom of the press in Eritrea. Another reason was the new liberal government of Denmark, that decided to reduce the aid budget.\n\nDevelopment assistance\nEritrea was chosen as a Danish programme country from 1993 to 1996, and again from 1999 to 2001. Denmark has been supporting Eritrea with counteracting land degradation. In 1996, Denmark contributed $35,000 through United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and in 1997, $111,000 through United Nations Truce Supervision Organization to Eritrea. In 1996, Denmark assisted 112 million DKK to the agriculture sector, and 80 million DKK to the education sector. The total aid to the Eritrean agricultural programme amounted 112 million DKK. (US$15 million) From 2001 to 2004, Denmark assisted Eritrea 36.60 million DKK for the justice sector. In 2001, both countries agreed to develop the legal sector. In 2001, Denmark donated $2.199 million to support the clearance of landmines in Eritrea.\n\nHigh level visits\nIn the 2000 Arab League summit in Cairo, President Afewerki met Prince Frederik and called the relationship between Denmark and Eritrea \"exemplary\". In February 2001, Danish Foreign Minister Mogens Lykketoft visited Eritrea, to discuss development programmes between Denmark and Eritrea.\n\nSee also\nForeign relations of Denmark\nForeign relations of Eritrea\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "Mocha Uson Blog is a blog site by Filipino entertainer, political blogger, and public official, Mocha Uson. A former standalone blog site, it is currently a Facebook page, after www.mocha.com.ph went defunct in February 2017.\n\nHistory\nThe Mocha Uson Blog previously concentrated on giving sex-related tips or advice. It also featured 'sessions in the bedroom' with her all-female group, the Mocha Girls. According to her, it later became a platform for Filipinos to express their concerns which are relayed by Mocha to the national government. The page became an online political advocacy tool by Uson to promote the 2016 presidential campaign of Rodrigo Duterte and by October 2016 most of the sex-themed videos hosted by the page were already deleted but copies remain accessible through other non-related YouTube accounts.\nThe Facebook page's followers increased to 4 million after Uson became a vocal supporter of President Rodrigo Duterte. According to Uson, the Facebook page had \"quite a number of followers\" before she became a public supporter of Duterte.\nWhen then-President-elect Duterte decided to boycott mainstream media organizations, Uson declared support for Duterte and managed to secure an exclusive interview with Duterte in June 2016. Videos of the interview were posted on the Mocha Uson Blog page.\nMocha Uson Blog, aside from being hosted in a Facebook page, had a separate blog site which was hosted at https://mocha.com.ph/. But by October 2016, the blog site only hosted external links to accounts managed by Mocha Uson including the Mocha Uson Blog Facebook page. By February 2017, blog site is already defunct.\nBy January 2018, a mobile app version of the blog became available for download in iOS and Android devices.\nAs of March 20, 2020, the blog is not searchable on Facebook. On Twitter, the hashtag #MochaUsonisOverParty became the number one trend in the Philippines before the blog became unsearchable. The hashtag users sought to encourage people to mass report the blog. Few days later, her Facebook page resurfaced again online.\n\nContent\nMocha Uson Blog has focused on publishing sex-related content before transitioning to politics during the 2016 Philippine national elections.\nThe mobile application version of the blog developed by Cloud Panda PH Inc. allows users to post videos, text, and videos as well as access features such as Mocha TV, DDS Podcast, and OFW Help.\n\nNotable posts\nPepederalismo\nIn August 2018, a video uploaded by Mocha Uson Blog featuring a blogger named Drew Olivar and Mocha Uson herself garnered nationwide attention and criticism. The live video, dubbed as \"Pepedederalismo\" by the media, was criticized for being lewd and obscene. The video showed Olivar dancing in a sexually suggestive manner by repeatedly touching his crotch and chest while singing lyrics about \"pepederalismo\", a portmanteau of federalism and the colloquial terms for vagina (pekpek) and breasts (dede). Uson said there was \"nothing wrong with the video\", which she said was meant to generate conversation among Filipinos about the concept of federalism. She said the jingle was not part of the government's official information campaign on the topic. She also said that she did not receive any government funding to produce the controversial video, albeit it wasn't immediately clear if she recorded the video during her working hours as a government employee.\n\nDisrespecting sign language\nIn September 2018, Mocha Uson and co-blogger Drew Olivar drew flak from netizens and criticism from deaf advocates and Filipinos for posting a video that made fun of sign language.\n\nReception\nAccording to one news article published by PhilStar, the then-defunct Mocha Uson Blog website www.mocha.com.ph had 20 million hits in 2016, making it a popular website. The Facebook page of Mocha Uson Blog had over 4.5 million followers during that year, while its mobile application has been downloaded more than 10,000 times as of 2018. As of 22 September 2021, the website was set up to redirect to a Twitter account with the handle @PhilippinesPHP, with the domain name having been taken over by another unconnected entity per its WHOIS record.\nVincent Lazatin of executive director of the Transparency and Accountability Network has criticized Mocha Uson Blog for its polarizing content. Maria Ressa of Rappler has also criticized the blog for allegedly being a pro-Duterte propaganda tool that \"takes advantage of Facebook algorithm\".\nAteneo de Manila University student journalists published a pamphlet titled Mochang Tanga Blog that tackled social issues and parodied Mocha Uson Blog.\nA Change.org petition advocating the removal of Mocha Uson Blog from Facebook was launched in 2016 by a certain Paul Quilet. It had gathered 35,000 signatures as of October 24, 2016.\n\nSee also\nDuterte Diehard Supporters\nRJ Nieto\nMocha Uson\n\nExternal links\nMocha Uson Blog on Facebook\n\n\n== References ==",

    "title": "Addie Brown",
    "text": "Addie Brown  (December 21, 1841 – January 11, 1870) was an American working-class free Black woman, who worked in various New England towns and wrote of her difficulties to earn a living. Her letters depict not only the racism and sexism faced by Northern Black women, but also her struggles with education, her awareness of politics, and her romantic friendship with Rebecca Primus. An acute observer, she provided through her letters perspective on the lives of working-class people in the nineteenth century, as well as on women's intimate relationships.\nBrown was raised in Philadelphia and had no formal education. She learned to read and write and, in order to improve her ability to earn a living, to sew and cook. Having few ties with her own family, she became an intimate member of the prominent Primus family of Hartford, Connecticut. For a decade between 1859 and 1868, she had a romantic friendship with the oldest daughter of the family and exchanged letters with her. The letters tell of Brown's fourteen different employers and eight addresses during the period, in addition to giving information about her chronic illnesses and fatigue. She wrote vivid descriptions of events in the Black communities in which she lived. Housed in the Primus collection of the Connecticut Museum of Culture and History, her letters give rare insight into the lives of working-class Black women in the period immediately preceding and following the American Civil War.\n\nEarly life and education\nAdeline Brown was born on December 21, 1841, and was raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as a free Black person. Her father died during her childhood and her mother remarried, despite Addie's objections. She lived briefly with an aunt in Philadelphia, and then cut off ties with her family, except for a brother, Ally Brown, who served in the Civil War. Brown did not have a formal education, and although she had learned to read and write, her handwriting was difficult to read and peppered with poor grammar and colloquial speech. It is unknown how she came to know the Primus family of Hartford, Connecticut. She may have attended the Shiloh Baptist Church in Philadelphia, which was pastored by Jeremiah Asher, a first cousin to Holdridge Primus, or have been a boarder in the Primus's home. She might also have worked at a restaurant in Hartford owned by Jeremiah Jacobs and Raphael Sands. Jacobs was the brother of Mehitable Primus and Sands was their brother-in-law. Although it is unknown how she met the family, by 1859, Brown was part of the inner circle of the Primus family and had begun an intense friendship with Holdridge and Mehitable's oldest daughter, Rebecca.\nBrown was described as tall, and although she exchanged photographs with Primus, none have been found. Her letters reveal her to be friendly, congenial, and spirited, but cautious in showing affection. Independent and confident, she made pragmatic choices to survive and had little patience with irritable people.  She was at times a mischief-maker, but she was open and honest about her feelings and poured out her emotions in her letters. Lacking close family ties, Brown created fictitious family connections with friends. Ally, the one brother with whom she kept in touch, broke off contact with her after she was unable to visit him for Thanksgiving because she needed to work. She was bright, intelligent, keenly observant, and a good story-teller, bringing life and detail to the events she described in her letters.\n\nCareer\nIn 1859, Brown was employed by the Games family of Waterford, Connecticut. Her charge, Mrs. Games, was ill and Brown found the post unsatisfactory, primarily because of the unwanted advances of Mr. Games. Although Mrs. Games offered to continue the position, Brown did not accept, longing to return to Hartford and Rebecca Primus. In a February 1860 letter, she asked Primus to intercede with her mother so that she could learn how to sew, realizing that sewing would allow her to work even if she did not have the physical stamina to do domestic work. Returning to Hartford, she worked for a few months for a Mrs. Kellogg, but left in August, after experiencing a severe sunburn. By early 1861, Brown was living in the household of John H. Jackson, proprietor of an eating house and saloon in New York City. Her brother Ally also resided in this family's home, which was also a boardinghouse, in Greenwich Village. Brown cared for the couple's nine children and kept their house, but was rarely paid. Instead, Mrs. Jackson at times treated Brown as if she was family and at other times as if she was an apprentice learning the trade to be a milliner and seamstress.\nStruggling with overwork and irregular pay, Brown left the Jacksons in September 1862, and returned to Hartford. In 1862, she worked for Primus's family friends Henry and Elizabeth Nott. Elizabeth allowed Primus to spend the night with Brown at her home, but these visits stopped when Rebecca's father, Holdridge, objected. For the rest of her first three years in Hartford, little is known of Brown's employment. Few letters were written by Brown, since she and Primus were living in the same town. The letters that exist in the period show that at this time their physical relationship became more intense. In 1865, Brown worked at Smith's Dye House, an establishment resembling a modern laundry or dry cleaner. She made good money, $19 per month at a time when female domestic workers earned about $2.65 per month including their board. From her salary, she paid Primus's aunt, Emily Sands, about $8.50 per month for room and board. Brown also worked regular hours, instead of being on call at all hours of the day and night when working in a household. She lost the job because of a lack of customers in December 1865.\n\nThe previous month, Primus had gone to Maryland to establish a school for the Freedmen's Bureau. Brown recognized at that time that although her feelings for Primus had not lessened, it was likely that their lives would be lived separately. One of her suitors for several years had been Joseph Tines. He was a waiter on the Granite State steamship, which regularly ran between Hartford and New York City. He was originally from Philadelphia, so she may have known him from childhood there, or met him when she was working in New York. She announced her engagement to Tines in a letter to Primus in December 1865. At that time, Brown was working for various Hartford ladies – Mrs. Couch, Mrs. Doughlass, and Mrs. Swans – sewing garments and hoping to make enough money to get through the winter of 1866. She often secured clients through Mehitable. By February, she was working for professor John T. Huntington, who taught at Trinity College. From the beginning the job did not go well as Huntington had agreed to pay her $2.50 per week and then tried to pay her only $2.00. Brown objected and was successful in the dispute, but did not like the work and left in April, taking in sewing until she secured a position with the Crowell family in May.\nBrown remained at the Crowells for a year, but in May 1867 moved to Farmington to work at Miss Porter's School, as an assistant to Raphael Sands. She initially enjoyed working at the school, the comradery of other workers, and the ability to use the library. She earned $12 per month and did not have to pay for room and board, but the work was exhausting and she reported that she often had headaches, backaches, and poor health. She also experienced racist attitudes while working at the school. Her political conscience was growing at the time and she reported in letters to Primus that she refused to attend a minstrel show and protested against the local church's segregated seating. She took over Raphael's position as head cook in the summer, but decided in January 1868 that she was definitely going to marry. Even though Miss Porter offered to hire both Brown and Tines, Brown turned down the job because it was so strenuous. In April, Brown married Tines and moved back to Philadelphia. An anonymous letter, possibly from Tines, indicates that they had a happy life and children.\n\nCorrespondence\nBrown wrote more than a hundred letters to Primus between 1859 and 1869. They contain critical observations about the details of her life and work, society and politics, gossip about their community, her search for affection, and her expression of deep feeling for Primus. In some letters, she signed as Aerthena and addressed Primus as Stella. She often wrote of flirtations with suitors and the possibility of marriage, which were openly discussed without fear of threat to their own relationship. Her principle emotional attachment was to Primus, but she recognized the importance of marriage for her economic security and social stability. From 1862, the nature of the letters changed, with Brown focusing on what she was reading and her involvement in community events. She became more confident and wrote more of her efforts at self-improvement and the ways she tried to better her opportunities. She wrote of attending balls, fairs, and debates, giving perspective on the events which were important to the black community and weighing in on issues like emancipation, civil rights, and political events.\nAlthough the letters contain Brown's private thoughts and expressions of eroticism, the relationship between the two women was not a secret to their family and friends. Some of them felt the relationship was an infatuation that would dissolve after marriage. Mehitable accepted the relationship and acknowledged that if one of them had been a man, they might have married. Their community supported their friendship, as long as it would not interfere with a courtship with an eventual marriage to a man. Writing about a novel, Women Friendships by Grace Aguilar, that she had read, Brown analyzed whether the characters' differing social status, age, and education mirrored her own relationship with Primus. As the book was a cautionary tale against mixed-class friendships, Brown wondered if it meant that their relationship was doomed. According to sociologist Farah Griffin, Primus thought that class was less important than one's moral reputation. Besides Brown's own declarations of love for Primus, the letters also gossiped openly about topics like incest and sex outside of marriage, as well as of encounters with other women with whom she had shared a bed.\n\nDeath and legacy\nBrown died from tuberculosis on January 11, 1870, at her home. Primus had saved the correspondence Brown wrote to her, indicating the importance of their relationship. After Primus's death, the letters were acquired in 1934 by the Connecticut Museum of Culture and History. Women's historian Eloise E. Scroggins noted that Brown's letters \"provide insight into Black female relationships and the difficulties of life for Northern Blacks during the Civil War\" period. They reveal the precarious economic and political circumstances of African Americans living in New England both before and after the war; Brown had at least fourteen employers and eight addresses between 1859 and 1867. They also fill a void in the historical documentation about Black women's private lives. History has often focused on records left by organizations and leaders, paying scarce attention to the lives and interactions of ordinary people and particularly women's lives have remained unexplored.\nResearch on romantic friendships has also focused on White women's relationships, which do not typically depict an erotic nature to their passionate attachments. Some scholars, such as Carroll Smith-Rosenberg and Lillian Faderman, have argued that liaisons between White women at the time describe kissing, hugging, and sharing a bed, but not sexual contact. Other scholars, according to Sue Morgan, Judith M. Bennett and Leila J. Rupp, have disagreed, noting that the depiction of romantic friendship as devoid of lesbian behavior was premature as while few documents have surfaced, some have, and such a conclusion might erase lesbian identity. Nevertheless, Brown's letters add dimension to the analysis of nineteenth-century same-sex relationships, as she openly wrote of their passion, kisses, and touching of the breasts. The relationship between Brown and Primus defies modern definitions of heterosexual and homosexual relationships, because of the separate spheres in which men and women lived their lives in the nineteenth century. What the letters show, according to sociologist Karen Hansen, is that sexuality was more fluid in the Victorian era than had been previously acknowledged by scholars. Their relationship also gives insight into the attitudes among members of the Black community in the years after slavery ended.\n\nNotes\nReferences\nCitations\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===",

    "title": "Billy Corkhill",
    "text": "Billy Corkhill is a fictional character from the British Channel 4 soap opera Brookside and Hollyoaks, played by John McArdle. The character debuted on-screen during the episode broadcast on 27 August 1985. Billy was introduced as part of the show's new family, the Corkhills, consisting of Billy, his wife Doreen Corkhill (Kate Fitzgerald), and their teenage children, Rod (Jason Hope) and Tracy Corkhill (Justine Kerrigan). Billy is characterised as the reluctant husband of Doreen, an aspiring woman who wants the Corkhills to own their own home. Her mission to present a good image for the family is marred by her secret spending which gets the family into debt. Writers explored their debt issues throughout Billy's early tenure. They portrayed him as desperate to provide, tampering with the electricity and committing fraud with the help of his brother Jimmy Corkhill (Dean Sullivan).\nWriters portrayed Billy having a mental breakdown in which he drives his car over his neighbours' front gardens. McArdle has said it was his favourite storyline as Billy. Doreen's over spending and Billy's crime of armed robbery eventually end their marriage. Producers then paired the character with Sheila Grant (Sue Johnston) and they later marry. Doreen returned to the series but Billy decides to remain loyal to Sheila. Billy was well received by viewers, especially for his representation of unemployed men in British society during the 1980s. Television critics have praised on McArdle's portrayal of Billy. Allan Crow from Fife Today branded Billy a \"legendary soap character\" and Andrew Bullock from the Daily Express opined that McArdle was an \"integral\" cast member \"in Brookside's heyday\". The character also became subjected to controversy when the Independent Broadcasting Authority investigated Brookside after an episode depicted Billy holding durex condoms. The regulator later retracted their complaint and praised the show. McArdle reprised the role of Billy in 2025 in several special Brookside and Hollyoaks crossover episodes as part of latter's 30th Anniversary.\n\nCasting\nMcArdle was performing in a play which he thought was so awful he wanted to quit. The director convinced him to stay with the promise of helping secure further work. In the play, McArdle put on a Scouse accent and a Brookside producer witnessed his performance which resulted in an audition. The director was then hired by Brookside and they helped McArdle secure the role of Billy. Kate Fitzgerald was hired to play Billy's wife Doreen. Jason Hope and Justine Kerrigan were then cast as their children, Rod and Tracy respectively. In an interview about his casting, Hope recalled that he had to meet with McArdle and Fitzgerald to ensure they \"could pass of as family members.\" Kerrigan branded McArdle a \"brilliant actor and a lovely man\" and praised the casting dynamic of the Corkhills. She added that McArdle \"was another delight to work with [...] John would take you by surprise with the energy he put into everything, he kept you on your toes. He would start off in some scenes and I would have no idea where it would go, he was amazing at that.\"\n\nDevelopment\nIntroduction and family\nBilly's profession is an electrician and the Corkhills move to Brookside Close from a council housing estate. Billy is characterised as a devoted husband who loves his wife Doreen enough to risk financial ruin by purchasing a home of their own. Despite being an electrician by trade, Billy works at a processed food factory. In the book Brookside: The Official Companion, Billy is described as a \"be-denimed Derek Hatton look-alike\" who has lived most of his life on a council estate. In his backstory, Billy had been led astray by his \"villainous\" brothers but his marriage to Doreen proved a \"stabilising influence\". He is portrayed as the reluctant husband to \"aspiring\" wife Doreen. Writers pitted the Corkhills against their more socialist neighbours, the Grant family. Billy has to contend with Doreen's \"shopaholic\" tendencies, as she competes with the Collins family and presents a \"good image\" of the Corkhills, an image she portrays despite knowing Billy's family have a \"shady\" side.\nBilly's plight resonated well with viewers, especially those facing hardship in 1980s Britain. McArdle started to receive letters from male viewers who believed that Billy's story was identical to their own experiences. McArdle's performance also blurred fiction and reality with some viewers. The actor received job offers from businessmen and a young viewer sent their £2 pocket money to the Brookside set to help Billy. So convincing was Billy's character that a gangster approached McArdle in a bar offering advice how to commit better robberies. McArdle felt that Billy's unemployment story was his \"hardest\" story. He told Richard Johnson from TV Guide that \"I've been in trade unions, I've been on picket lines - for me that was the very hardest thing I had to do.\"\nA controversial story for the Corkhills was created when Tracy begins a romance with her geography teacher Peter Montague (Mark Draper). After the pair return from a skiing trip, Billy goes to the school and punches Peter. Billy is arrested for assault and later given a three month prison sentence, suspended for a year. At the time, Lucy O'Brien from The Guardian described it as the \"most dramatic analysis\" of child abuse on television. She added that \"pugnacious Billy\" had to face the fact his \"wayward daughter\" was in love with her teacher; the story subsequently played out over a \"tense month\". From this producers developed an issue lead story for the Corkhills, as they deal with the problems that arise from debts. Billy is sacked from his job at Pollocks because his court case garnered negative publicity. The Corkhills mounting debts result in their utilities being cut off and their television is repossessed. Billy tries to help his family out of debt by tampering with the electricity supply. This causes problems with his son Rod, who is training to be a police officer. Writers continued to develop the story into 1987. Billy's brother, Jimmy Corkhill (Dean Sullivan) convinces him to allow him to stage a burglary at his home but Jimmy also steals from the Collins family to make it appear genuine. This upsets Doreen and she discovers the stolen property and the bank begin repossession proceedings. After all of Billy's crimes, McArdle told Johnson (TV Guide) that \"at one time I thought I couldn't live next door to Billy Corkhill.\" He added that the supermarket robbery would continue to be an issue for Billy, adding that the writers \"can bring that up at any time.\"\n\nMental breakdown\nWriters created one of the show's \"significant moments\" when they created a large hole in the middle of Brookside Close. The hole was actually dug into one of the back garden sets as it was impractical to dig into the actual road. Camera trickery was used to make character interaction with the hole appear authentic. The significance of the hole in relation to Billy was that other characters drove over his front garden lawn to avoid the hole. Billy's unemployment cause him much stress and his neighbours' disregard for his home results in Billy having a breakdown. Billy retaliates by going on a rampage in his car, driving all over the other front gardens on Brookside Close.\nMcArdle told Graham Kibble-White, the author of 20 Years of Brookside, that his character reacted badly because he suspected Doreen of having an affair with her work boss at the dentists. Doreen had not had an affair with her boss but he could not believe she was willing to have sex with him in exchange for money. McArdle told Johnson that \"Billy just felt like a total failure - that his wife had nearly turned to prostitution because of him being unemployed. He smacked her. She threw the key in the mud.\" Billy subsequently felt like his \"whole word [and] his whole family were falling down.\" Kibble-White believed that the car scene perfectly demonstrated the desperation that Billy. He felt like a \"non-person\" whose neighbours disrespected him for being a \"dole-ite\". Ken Horn, who directed the episode added that it was a well-remembered Brookside moment and credited its success to McArdle and Fitzgerald's \"terrific\" acting. McArdle was allowed to perform the driving stunt himself. He added \"it was a gift to get material like that and to be able to actually do it.\" After the scenes were broadcast, viewers sympathised with Billy's plight and told him that he had \"exorcised\" all of their feelings on-screen. Billy's breakdown was filmed in one take because McArdle wanted to capture the emotion. He added that the crew were sensitive and rehearsed without McArdle and Fitzgerald until the final take. McArdle added that too much rehearsal would have \"diminished\" the authenticity of the scene.\nThe debt story culminated in the break-down of Billy and Doreen's marriage. He becomes desperate for money and participates in an armed robbery at a supermarket. Billy drives the getaway vehicle but the supermarket manager is injured. Doreen decides to leave Billy, but keeps his involvement a secret from Rod. She leaves in November 1987 and in February 1988, Billy travels to Bristol to find Doreen. Doreen's departure from the series occurred because Fitzgerald was exhausted and unhappy with the role. Doreen and Billy \"had been going through fairly painful emotions\", which won Fitzgerald and McArdle weekly praise from television critics. Fitzgerald told Anthony Hayward from TVTimes that she and other actors disliked the Corkhill's backstory because \"it was a nonsense in the first place\". She explained that Billy and Doreen met at a young age and she put all of her energy into her family from then on. Fitzgerald believed it \"out of character\" for Doreen to put her family into debt, but she praised the writers who \"worked hard\" to \"make it believable.\" In 1997, McArdle said that the breakdown was his \"favourite storyline of all time\", adding that \"it was absolutely fantastic to do\".\n\nMarriage to Sheila Grant\nBilly is later paired romantically with Sheila Grant (Sue Johnston). Sheila moves into the Corkhill's house following the end of her marriage to Bobby Grant (Ricky Tomlinson). Billy develops a close friendship with Sheila and in episodes airing set on New Years Eve 1988, the pair share their first kiss. Writers developed the story into a serious relationship. In 1989 McArdle and Johnston were written out of Brookside for two months. Producers had allowed the actors the time off to appear in a theatre production. Writers reintroduced Doreen into the show in 1989 to create problems for Billy and Sheila. Fitzgerald had declined the producer's request for her return the previous year. She is reintroduced Doreen back into the Corkhill household, despite Sheila living in the home. Sheila orders Billy to get rid of Doreen, but he refuses. Sheila moves out instead and writers plotted Doreen attempting to resume her broken marriage. Fitzgerald added \"I think you can assume it will be a good bit of drama.\"\nJohnston welcomed the return of Doreen because it added drama for Billy and Sheila. She told Karen Swayne from Chat magazine that \"everyone has been getting a bit nice in the Close. It's got a bit even keel and it needed conflict to give it an edge.\" Fitzgerald stated that she found the scripts \"rather shocking\" because of the dialogue the two females exchange. Johnston added that Doreen is \"very uncompromising\" in the way she speaks to Sheila. Doreen insults her age and accuses her of being desperate. Fitzgerald concluded that her return gave fans what they wanted. She revealed that people would approach her in public and tell her that she needed to get back with Billy because she was \"breaking their hearts\". In August, Doreen empties the house of Sheila's belongings and changes the locks. She then makes Billy's involvement in the supermarket robbery common knowledge causing Sheila to break-up with Billy. He later tells Doreen he does not love her and the she was written out the series once again.\nBilly and Sheila's wedding took place in episodes aired in August 1990. Filming the scenes became a case of life imitating art. In the episode, Billy is late for the wedding because his car breaks down. McArdle's car actually broke down on his way to film the scenes. McArdle had to call the AA out to the motorway for help. McArdle told Andrea Kon from TVTimes that he was upset but \"didn't have to think about\" acting the scene out immediately after it happened for real. He added that he thought Johnston would be on set \"tearing her hair out\" over him.\nOn-screen, Billy and Rod abandon the car and run on foot to the Register Office. The wedding ceremony is nearly ruined because of Jimmy. McArdle explained that \"Billy knew things would go wrong with Jimmy in charge. He doesn't trust his brother as far as he can throw him. But he's delighted he's got his girl to the altar at long last.\" The wedding also brought about the end to Sheila and Tracy's fraught relationship. Kerrigan told Kon that \"Tracy doesn't actively dislike Sheila. She's tolerated her for her father's sake and she's pleased her dad has a chance to be happy.\" Off-screen production planned to cancel filming if it rained outside. The weather on that morning changed from \"dull\" and production went ahead. Set designers transformed the Bluecoats School board room into a make-shift Registry Office venue.\n\nGodden feud and departure\nWriters created two new feud stories for Billy. The first begins in November 1989 with Mr Trevor (Fred Bryant), after Billy rewires the electrics inside his wool shop. Mr Trevor is slow to pay Billy for the job resulting in Billy and Jimmy escalating a vendetta. Mr Trevor sends his sons Carl Trevor (Mark Moraghan) and Rob Trevor (Seamus O'Neil) to get revenge on the Corkhills. They drive a JCB digger onto Brookside Close, dig up Billy's front lawn and deposit it onto his garage roof.\nThe second and more significant feud revisits a long-standing rivalry between the Corkhill and Godden families. Billy and Jimmy's older brother Frankie Corkhill had been murdered by Joey Godden (Carl Chase) some years earlier. Jimmy attacks Joey inside The Swan pub, but Jimmy is later beaten and hospitalised. Godden begins to threaten the Corkhills and sends a wreath to their home reading \"Billy and Sheila - R.I.P\". Billy tries to reason with Godden but he vows to carry on. Billy tells Rod about his criminal past in order for him to admit the truth about the Godden feud. He asks Rod to unofficially involve himself in getting rid of Godden, but he opts to report the matter to a detective at work. Godden agrees to a truce on the condition the Corkhill's keep out of The Swan and The British Lion. Jimmy is angry about the truce and he gets their cousin Don Corkhill (Bernard Merrick) to join him for a drink in The British Lion. They are confronted by Godden and a bar fight break out, resulting in Don being murdered by Godden. Then Godden digs up Frankie's grave and removes the headstone. He then launches the headstone through the front door glass of Billy and Sheila's home. This escalation causes Barry to intervene to protect his mother, Sheila and he threatens Godden with a shotgun. Godden is scared of Barry and he agrees to leave the Corkhills alone.\nMcArdle and Johnston decided to leave Brookside in 1990. Off-screen the pair had planned a national theatre tour of their two-handed show titled To. Johnston revealed that producers would not be killing off their characters so that they could return in the future. Billy and Sheila's departure story featured them moving to begin a new life in Basingstoke.\n\nReturn to role\nOn 28 August 2025, it was announced that McArdle had reprised his role for a Brookside and Hollyoaks crossover episode as part of latter's 30th Anniversary. He appeared in additional episodes of Hollyoaks. Of his return, McArdle stated \"it's going to be a nostalgic visit back to the famous close. Also I've got to try and find the character of Billy Corkhill again as I haven't played him for 35 years!\" His return was announced following the confirmation that Johnston would also returning to her role as Sheila.\n\nReception\nAs the men of Brookside Close go, Billy Corkhill ranks up there with the very best of them. He was a solid working-class local lad, whose battles with bouts of unemployment, troublesome children and errant wives, made him a hero to those who fought to keep their heads above water in the 80s. He remains one of Brookside's best-loved and most memorable characters.A writer from the official Brookside website stated \"a dominating presence on the Close for the second half of the ‘80s, Billy Corkhill ensured his legacy would last for at least another decade.\" Allan Crow from Fife Today branded Billy a \"legendary soap character\". Tim Hughes from the Oxford Mail said that McArdle is \"best known\" as the \"long-suffering\" Billy. Patrick McLennan from What's on TV opined that Billy is a \"troubled\" character. Matt Wolf from The Sacramento Bee stated that Brookside's characters, such as the Corkhills, represent the British working class and their problems. They added \"a typical episode shows the Corkhills behind in their rent. Tracy's job is in the balance, Billy is unemployed and Doreen bets on horses to make ends meet.\" Gareth McLean from The Guardian opined that Billy and Doreen were an accurate portrayal of \"the aspiring lower-middle-class\" living in Liverpool. Catherine Jones from the Liverpool Echo said the Corkhill's were \"blighted by financial difficulties\" and that McArdle was best known as Billy. McArdle agreed with Jones' assessment and revealed that he even gets recognised as Billy in Australia. Another critic from the publication believed that Doreen getting a new job and suit was another reason for Billy to whine. They added \"I really think it's time she pushed the miserable little berk under a bus.\" Liam Rudden writing for the Edinburgh Evening News echoed this stating that McArdle is \"known and loved by millions as Billy Corkhill.\" A Lancashire Telegraph writer stated that McArdle \"won millions of fans as Billy Corkhill\".\nHilary Kingsley from Sunday Mirror believed that \"the semi-comic, semi-tragic Corkhills\" were relatable characters because it was likely viewers knew \"a nutter like Billy and a silly cow like Doreen.\" Reminiscing of the importance of Billy, Andrew Bullock from the Daily Express wrote \"in Brookside's heyday, John was an integral part of the cast, playing Billy Corkhill – who endured a mental breakdown as part of his story line.\" A writer for The Guide Liverpool said \"played superbly by scouse actor, John McArdle, Billy narrowly escaped a prison stay, armed robbery, periods of depression and that mad episode where he drove over all the neighbours gardens shouting 'I'm just a doleite'.\" Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy opined that Billy driving over his neighbours' driveways is one \"Brookside's most memorable scenes\". The Corkhills' house was depicted as the most rundown household on Brookside Close. Author Geoff Tibbals quipped \"the natural starting point for any tour of the Close is the Corkhills' house, which, in the days of Doreen and Billy, was the only residence a brick through the window qualified as a home improvement.\"\nIn 2003, Frances Traynor from the Daily Record branded Billy and Sheila's romance as one of the show's \"most controversial plotlines\". Traynor observed that \"everyone knew they were destined to be together, but it still took Billy Corkhill and Sheila Grant months to realise it. Their first kiss on New Year's Eve was as romantic as anything Hollywood could come up with.\" Similarly, a writer from The Observer opined that Brookside captured viewers' imaginations, adding \"who did not gulp in recognition and hope when Billy Corkhill and Sheila Grant exchanged a meaningful glance across the crowded close?\" They also believed that the show's stories eventually became sensationalist plotlines. They favoured early dramatic stories such as Billy's armed robbery, which \"seemed to make sense\". The Guardian's John Mulholland branded Billy \"the neighbour from hell\". A reporter from Inside Soap wrote that \"we just wanted to cheer when the pair finally got it together, because if anyone deserved happiness, it was Sheila.\" Jim Shelley (The Guardian) opined that Billy and Sheila's departures caused the quality of Brookside to decline. Richard Johnson from TV Guide branded Billy a \"daft melt\", \"the Scouse with the nous\", Liverpool's \"second coming\" and concluded that \"like fellow Liverpudlian Derek Hatton, Corkhill is not everyone's choice of Neighbour\". Inside Soap's Jon Peake wrote that Billy is known for his fake burglaries, run-ins with gangsters and nearly making his wife a prostitute. He added that Billy was a hero to the struggling men living in Britain during the 1980s.\nIn 1998, writers from Inside Soap published an article about the top ten characters they wanted to return to soap. Billy was featured and they described him as Jimmy's \"hot-tempered younger brother\". The publication later ran a feature compiling \"The 100 greatest soap stories ever told\". They featured Billy and Sheila's romance as their 96th choice. They were also included in the magazine's \"greatest love stories ever told\" feature. A reporter wrote that \"they were an unlikely couple. He was a rugged working-class hero, she was a saintly figure wracked with Catholic guilt. But when Billy took in Sheila after her husband Bobby left her, friendship grew into true love.\" Paul Brooks from Soaplife included Billy and Sheila in his list of \"dream lovers\". He assessed that Billy was \"a reformed scally, a man who'd fiddled more leccy meters than Ron Dixon has had angina attacks\".\nAn episode featured Billy discovering a packet of Durex branded condoms, belonging to his daughter Tracy and her boyfriend Jamie Henderson (Sean McKee). The scene depicted Billy with the condom's branding visible for 1.83 seconds. This caused controversy in the United Kingdom and the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) lodged a complaint against Brookside claiming it featured in the scene for too long. Channel 4 asked Phil Redmond for a response to submit to the IBA. In his response he detailed how Brookside wanted to promote safe sex and educate viewers during the 1980s AIDS in the United Kingdom. The IBA changed their stance on the scene and told Redmond that it was \"absolutely marvellous\".\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography",

    "title": "Symphony No. 7 (Penderecki)",
    "text": "Krzysztof Penderecki wrote his Seventh Symphony, subtitled \"Seven Gates of Jerusalem\", in 1996 to commemorate the third millennium of the city of Jerusalem. Originally conceived as an oratorio, this choral symphony was premièred in Jerusalem in January 1997; it was only after the first Polish performance two months later that Penderecki decided to call it a symphony. It is written for two sopranos, alto, tenor, bass, narrator, chorus and orchestra.\n\nMovements\nThe symphony is written in seven movements and lasts approximately 60 minutes:\n\nMagnus Dominus et laudabilis nimis in civitate (Great is the Lord, and to be praised, from Psalm 48)\nSi oblitus fuero tui, Ierusalem (If I forget you, Jerusalem, from Psalm 137)\nDe profundis (Out of the depths, Psalm 130)\nSi oblitus fuero tui, Ierusalem (If I forget you, Jerusalem)\nLauda, Jerusalem, Dominum (Praise the Lord, Jerusalem, Psalm 147)\nHajetà alai jad adonài (The hand of the Lord was upon me, Ezechiel 37, 1–10)\nHaec dicit Dominus (Thus says the Lord)\n\nInstrumentation\nThe symphony is scored for 4 flutes (3rd & 4th doubling piccolo), 3 oboes, cor anglais, 3 clarinets (3rd doubling E flat clarinet), bass clarinet, 3 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 4 trombones, tuba, percussion, celesta, piano, organ (ad lib) and strings.\nIn addition, there are offstage parts for 3 clarinets (3rd doubling E flat clarinet), bass clarinet, 3 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns, 3 trumpets (including a bass trumpet, prominent in the 6th movement), 4 trombones and tuba.\n\nOverview\nComposition\nIn 1995 Penderecki was commissioned to write a work to commemorate the third millennium of Jerusalem, a city the composer had first visited in 1974 in the aftermath of the Yom Kippur War. Penderecki decided to write an oratorio titled Seven Gates of Jerusalem (there is an eighth \"golden\" gate but, according to Jewish tradition, this is reserved for the arrival of the Messiah). Penderecki composed the work between April and December 1996. The work was premiered in Jerusalem on 9 January 1997; the orchestra included members of the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra and Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Lorin Maazel. The Polish premiere followed on 14 March 1997, under the direction of Kazimierz Kord. It was only after the Polish performance that the composer decided to call the work his Seventh Symphony, though he had not yet completed his Sixth Symphony (which would eventually be published and premiered in 2017). The composer has since also written an Eighth Symphony, which like the Seventh is a choral symphony.\nIn categorizing the work, James L. Zychowicz writes in his review:\n\nThis work also belongs to the choral symphony of the nineteenth century, reminiscent in a sense of Mahler’s Eighth Symphony for its use of voices throughout the work. Similarly, Mahler’s efforts to bring together different texts—in the case of the Eighth Symphony, the Latin hymn “Veni creator spiritus” and the final scene from the second part of Goethe’s Faust, Penderecki combined verses from various psalms, as well as different parts of the Old Testament. Psalms and prophetic texts are brought together in this Jerusalem–inspired work which, in this sense, reflects those aspects of the old city as a place of worship and a locus of prophetic vision. In this sense, it is a return to those seventeenth-century composers, whose works use large forces along with concertato sonorities to present biblical texts, but conceived along much larger lines.\nZychowicz adds that while \"each of the movements is distinct enough to stand on its own merits, ... when conceived together, [they] form a cohesive symphonic structure.\"\nThe text of the symphony is written primarily in Latin, while the sixth movement, \"the most dramatic of the entire work,\" is written in Hebrew; the text in this penultimate movement, taken from the book of Ezekiel, is presented by a speaker.\n\nSignificance of the number seven\nWhile the symphony is not a pictorial or descriptive work, the number seven plays a significant part in it. The work is not only written in seven movements but is \"pervaded by the number 'seven' at various levels,\" with an extensive system of seven-note phrases binding the work together, \"while the frequent presence of seven notes repeated at a single pitch will be evident even on a first hearing, as also the seven fortissimo chords bringing the seventh and final movement to an end.\"\n\nMusical manipulation of text\nZychowicz states that the composer's manipulation of text may have been an important factor in shaping the musical structure of the work, as well. By setting selected verses instead of complete psalms, \"he gave the text focus and clarity.... Taken together, the verses for the first movement are ... essentially a new text, albeit one redolent of the psalter.\"  Zychowicz cites the last movement as another example of textual manipulation \"as Penderecki combines verses from three prophetic books, and then returns to the psalms, eventually bringing back the verse with which the Symphony opened.\" This manipulation of text, Zychowicz writes, \"suggests a level of composition ... that is linked to the musical structure of the work.\"\n\nOrder of text\nMagnus Dominus et laudabilis nimis in civitate\nPsalm 47 (48):1\nPsalm 95 (96):1–3\nPsalm 47 (48):1\nPsalm 47 (48):13\nPsalm 47 (48):1\nSi oblitus fuero tui, Ierusalem\nPsalm 136 (137):5\nDe profundis clamavi ad te, Domine\nPsalm 129 (130): 1–5\nSi oblitus fuero tui, Ierusalem\nPsalm 136 (137):5\nIsaiah 26:2\nIsaiah 52:1\nPsalm 136 (137):5\nLauda, Ierusalem, Dominum\nPsalm 147:12–14\nHajetà alai jad adonài\nEzekiel 37: 1–10\nHaec dicit Dominus\nJeremiah 21:8\nDaniel 7:13\nIsaiah 59:19\nIsaiah 60:1–2\nPsalm 47 (48):1\nIsaiah 60:11\nPsalm 95 (96):1; 2–3\nPsalm 47 (48):1\nPsalm 47(48):13\nPsalm 47(48):1\nPsalm 47(48):13\n\nFootnotes\nBibliography\nWhitehouse, Richard, notes to Naxos 8.557766, Krzysztof Penderecki: Symphony No. 7 \"Seven Gates of Jerusalem\"; Olga Pasichnyk, soprano; Aga Mikolaj, soprano; Ewa Marciniec, alto; Wieslaw Ochman, tenor; Romuald Tesarowicz, bass; Boris Carmeli, narrator; Warsaw National Philharmonic Choir and Warsaw National Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Antoni Wit.

    "text": "Mississippi Highway 590 (MS 590) is a state highway that runs for 22 miles (35 km) from the Seminary area at U.S. Route 49 (US 49) to just outside of Ellisville at MS 29 in the southern portion of Mississippi.\n\nRoute description\nMS 590's western terminus is located just west of the town of Seminary along US 49, just north of its intersection with MS 589. Heading east along Main Street into town (just past its crossing of the Okatoma Creek, the road passes some stores, homes, and churches. In the center of Seminary, MS 590 has the road name of Main Street and crosses a railroad at-grade. Towards the east side of town, it intersects MS 535 at its southern terminus. Once leaving town, the highway heads east through a mix of woods, open fields, poultry farms, and houses. The road transitions from Covington County to Jones County with similar surroundings from before. In rural Jones County, MS 590 crosses Leaf River. Starting to approach Ellisville, MS 590 has an interchange with Interstate 59 I-59) at its exit 85. MS 590 briefly parallels I-59 but then turns to the east to head around the north side of Jaycee Evaluation Center and Ellisville State School. Soon after, a quadrant road provides access to US 11 within the town limits of Ellisville. The highway crosses US 11, a railroad, and Rocky Creek on a 2,000-foot-long (610 m) bridge and then heads around the south side of Jones County Junior College with a driveway providing access to the college. Now curving slightly to the northeast, MS 590 ends southeast of downtown Ellisville at an intersection with MS 29.\n\nHistory\nThe general routing of MS 590 had existed in the state highway system since at least 1928. By 1950, the MS 590 designation was applied to this road with a small portion of the road around Seminary being paved. The road was slowly improved over the next few years until it had been fully improved by 1964. Beginning in 2011, the Mississippi Department of Transportation constructed a 2.3-mile-long (3.7 km) extension of MS 590 from just west of its original terminus at US 11 to MS 29 southeast of Ellisville. The construction also included a new entrance to Jones County Junior College. The extension was completed in September 2013.\n\nMajor intersections\nReferences\n\n\n== External links ==",

    "text": "Africando is a musical project formed in 1992 to unite New York–based salsa musicians with Senegalese vocalists. Musicians from other African countries were later included under the name Africando All Stars.\nSalsa has been a hugely popular style in Central and West Africa since the 1940s to 1950s, and the goal of Africando was to merge salsa rhythms from both sides of the Atlantic, mainly based on the African salsa tradition.\nAfricando was initiated by producer Ibrahima Sylla from Côte d'Ivoire and Malian arranger Boncana Maiga of Fania All-Stars. Some of the musicians initially involved were: Ronnie Baro (of Orquesta Broadway), Pape Seck (ex member of Star Band), Nicholas Menheim (associate of Youssou N'Dour), and Medoune Diallo (formerly with Orchestre Baobab).\nThe first two albums were a big success in Africa and in the World Music scene. Singer Pape Seck died in 1995, and was replaced by Gnonnas Pedro from Benin (who died August 2005) and Ronnie Baró of Orquestra Broadway.\nFor the album Mandali (2000), well known African musicians, such as Tabu Ley Rochereau, Koffi Olomidé, Salif Keita, Sekouba Bambino, Amadou Balaké and Thione Seck were invited. This new constellation led to the new name Africando All Stars. Whilst in the beginning, the songs were Latin American classics sung in wolof language or a mix of wolof and Spanish, newer songs were African popular music classics, redone with Latin rhythms and instrumentation. With both approaches, Africando has been equally successful.\nFor the album Martina (2003) the group name reverted to the name Africando. The singers on this tribute to mothers, sisters, wives and girlfriends include Ismaël Lô from Senegal, and Nyboma and King Kester Emeneya performing Papa Wemba's song \"La Référence\".\nGnonnas Pedro's last recording is the title track of Ketukuba (2006) – he died before the CD was released. The same fate befell Alfredo Rodriguez who arranged 3 tracks on the album.  With the emphasis on the links between Cuba and Africa, Ketukuba includes a Latinized version of Franco's \"Mario\", sung by Madilu System, and Joe King singing \"Nina Nina\", previously made famous by the Fania All Stars.\nIn 1998, the group covered Aïcha, primarily recorded by Khaled.\n\nDiscography\nAlbums\nVolume 1: Trovador (Stern's Africa STCD1045, 1993)\nVolume 2: Tierra Tradicional (Stern's Africa STCD1054, 1994) Released in France as Sabador\nGombo Salsa (Stern's Africa STCD1071, 1996)\nBaloba (Stern's Africa STCD1082, 1998)\nMandali (Stern's Africa STCD1092, 2000) Credited to Africando All Stars.

    "title": "Emmett Kelly",
    "text": "Emmett Leo Kelly (December 9, 1898 – March 28, 1979) was an American circus performer who created the clown character \"Weary Willie\", based on the hobos of the Great Depression in the 1930s.\n\nEarly life\nEmmett Leo Kelly was born in Sedan, Kansas, on December 9, 1898. His father, Thomas, was a section foreman for the Missouri Pacific Railroad. While he was still a child, the family moved to Southern Missouri where his father had purchased a farm in Texas County, near the community of Houston, Missouri. In the summer of 1909, he attended both the Mighty Haag and M.L. Clark and Son's circuses.\nAs a youth, he was enrolled by his mother, Mollie, in the Landon School of Cartooning, a correspondence school where he began developing his artistic skill.\nIn 1917, Kelly moved to Kansas City, hoping to get a job as a newspaper cartoonist. It was there that he created a cartoon of a tramp that he originally named \"Old Dubey\". While in Kansas City, Kelly began working for carnivals and circuses and trained as a trapeze artist.\nIn August 1920, Kelly returned to his adopted hometown of Houston, Missouri where he appeared as a \"cartoonist and comedy specialist\" at the town's annual \"Old Settlers Reunion\".\n\nEarly circus career\nKelly's first professional appearance as a clown was with Howe's Great London Circus on July 14, 1921, in Mason City, Iowa. Although he originally performed as a white-face clown, it was during that tour that he first appeared as a hobo character. After only a few performances as a tramp, Kelly returned to more traditional makeup, but not before a photograph was made of the character which would later be identified as \"Weary Willie.\" The photo appeared in the Howe's Great London Route Book of 1921 above a caption that read: \"Emmett Kelly, The Novelty Clown, Cartoonist, Tramp\".\nAt the end of the 1921 tour, the Howe's Great London Circus and Van Amburgh's Trained Wild Animal Show was acquired by the American Circus Corporation. In 1922 Kelly was assigned to perform his single trapeze act in the corporation's John Robinson Circus.\nKelly returned to John Robinson in 1923 and was part of a program that included eight members of the Moore family. The large troupe appeared in several displays including a double trapeze act featuring sisters Mitzi and Eva. Kelly married Eva in Charlottesville, Virginia, on July 21, 1923, and the pair began performing together on the trapeze.\nThe couple returned to the show in 1924, and as the season progressed, Emmett and Eva learned that they were expecting a child. On November 24, the last day of the John Robinson season, Emmett Kelly Jr. was born in Dyersburg, Tennessee.\nOn September 12, 1929, John Ringling purchased the American Circus Corporation. Included in the deal was the John Robinson show, along with the Al G. Barnes, Sparks, Sells-Floto and Hagenbeck-Wallace circuses.\nAs the economy suffered in 1930, disposable income dried up, and for many, circus tickets became a luxury. The John Robinson Circus, the oldest in the United States, was among the first to close, giving its final performance on September 5 at the Nebraska State Fair in Lincoln.\nAlthough fewer shows toured in 1931, The Aerial Kellys were among several acts that moved from John Robinson to the Ringling-owned Sells-Floto circus. Despite the fact that cowboy movie star Tom Mix was heavily promoted as a feature, Sells-Floto struggled. While the Kellys still considered themselves trapeze performers, Emmett was hired as a white-face clown with the Ringling-owned Hagenbeck-Wallace circus in 1932.\nA year later, the hobo character that had first been created on a drawing board in Kansas City came to life. Ragged homeless men were commonplace during the Depression, and on April 21, 1933, the tramp clown made his first appearance during a performance at the Chicago Coliseum.\nIn early 1934 a second child, Patrick, was born. At the end of the year, Hagenbeck-Wallace manager Jess Adkins, along with former Sells-Floto manager Zack Terrell, partnered to start their own show, the Cole Bros. and Clyde Beatty Combined Circus. Kelly was among those who made the jump from Hagenbeck-Wallace, although his wife Eva was not given a contract. Shortly after the season started, she asked for a divorce. Kelly later wrote that the sadness he experienced at the time worked its way into the character's persona.\nIn 1937, newspaper writer Hype Igho described the sad clown as \"Weary Willie.\" Igho had written about the act by using a term that originated decades earlier as a generic description for a nameless hobo.  Kelly later said that Igho encouraged him to use the name and overnight, the character that had once referred to as Old Dubey became Weary Willie.\nDuring the winter of 1937–38, Kelly was hired to perform with the Bertram Mills Circus at the Olympia in London. It was at his European debut that he put his own spin on a routine that a veteran clown named Charlie \"Shorty\" Flem had performed years earlier at Madison Square Garden.\nThe act, which would become Kelly's signature routine, began with him sweeping the ring. A spotlight followed him, and as it danced about, he slapped, swept, and chased the pool of light with his broom. Once he completed the spotlight routine, Willie blew up a balloon until it popped, and then pantomiming his sorrow, he buried the remains in the sawdust.\n\nBroadway and Hollywood\nWhen World War II broke out in September 1939, Kelly returned to the United States where he was cast in a new Broadway musical starring Jimmy Durante and Ray Bolger. The show, titled Keep Off the Grass, was set in New York's Central Park, where Weary Willie appeared as one of several tramps, including an up-and-comer named Jackie Gleason, who was also making his Broadway debut.\nDespite the star power of Durante and Bolger, Keep Off the Grass did not receive good notices. The only positive review came from the Time critic who wrote: \"...and there's a bum, Emmett Kelly, who would leisurely proceed to eat a ham sandwich out of a paper poke while a bunch of other bums sang a park bench song; then he would lazily brush his teeth with the dry stub of a toothbrush, which provides the one moment of an otherwise uninspired show.\"\nKeep off the Grass closed after only 44 performances, and Kelly returned to the nightclub circuit as a cartoonist dressed as a tramp. Even though he would appear in rooms that were often noisy, Willie never uttered a word, but, as one newspaper noted, \"with lightning speed he would knock out about eight cartoons in less time than you can write your name.\"\n\nRingling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey\nFor a year and a half Emmett made his living performing in nightclubs and indoor circuses until early 1941, when he received offers from both Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey and Cole Bros. After considering both opportunities, Kelly opted to go with Cole Bros., which promised a higher salary.\nIn the five years since Kelly had appeared under canvas in the United States, he honed his craft and matured as a performer to the point that the Cole Bros. publicity department touted him as \"the world's funniest clown.\" The stories that were placed in newspapers in advance of the circus described, and occasionally embellished, details associated with his tour of the United Kingdom.\nThe positive reviews caught the attention of Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey, and in 1942 he joined the circus for the first of fourteen seasons with the show. In 1944, the character that Kelly had created was cast as the star in the featured spectacle. Panto's Paradise was staged as a \"dream of a hobo in fairyland.\"\n\nHartford circus fire\nAlthough \"Panto's Paradise\" was Willie's big number in 1944, his first appearance occurred earlier in the program when the Wallendas were performing on the high wire. During the act, Willie would stand under their rigging, holding a small handkerchief as if to catch them should they fall. The gag had been getting laughs all season, and on July 6, while the circus was in Hartford, Connecticut, there was no reason to believe that anything would be different.\n\"As I was putting the finishing touches on my face, I could hear the band playing the waltz music that was my cue to amble into the center ring. At that instant someone ran past the dressing tent yelling ‘fire.’ I was trying to run in my big flapping shoes and suddenly realized that I was carrying a bucket of wash water I had grabbed when I left the dressing tent.\"\nKelly said that when he saw the big top burning, he knew that he had to help the panicked crowd exit the tent. It was then that he spotted flames burning near one of the large generator wagons. As he tried to douse the small fire with his bucket of water, he nearly became a casualty himself. \"One of the Caterpillar tractors came rumbling along to get that wagon – to hook on and pull it away from the crowd,\" he recalled. \"It was almost on top of me before I realized what was happening, and as it swung around it did not miss running over me by more than an inch.\"\nKelly's actions that day were immortalized by audience member Ralph Emerson, who took a photograph of Kelly in his full clown make-up and costume, carrying a single bucket of water. The photograph was published in Life on July 17, 1944.\nThe fire and the loss of 168 lives had a profound impact on Kelly. That night, after the victims had been transported to a temporary morgue, he reflected on what had happened. \"Leaving the showgrounds, I walked past the ruins of the big top and saw some charred shoes and part of a clown doll lying on what had been the hippodrome track. That moment was when the tensions of the past hours broke over me in a wave and I could not keep from crying any longer.\"\nThe fire investigation delayed the show's departure from Hartford for nine days, but on July 15 the trains were headed back to Sarasota, Florida, and within a month, the circus had resumed its tour, playing in stadiums and ballparks. Emmett was among those impressed by the resilience of the big show, telling a reporter \"We must entertain. In war time it is more important than ever. It is going to be great in the open air.\"\n\nReturn to Hollywood\nIn 1949, after a charity circus performance in Los Angeles, Emmett was approached by an agent representing David O. Selznick. On October 8, while Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey was in Tucson, Arizona, Kelly signed an exclusive one-year contract.\nAt the age of 51, the idea of starting a new career in motion pictures appealed to Kelly, and when the circus closed in Miami, Florida on November 25, he immediately left for California and Hollywood.\nIn the months that followed various ideas were pitched, until finally he was given a script based on a radio mystery series titled The Fat Man. In the film, Kelly would be cast as the villain. Although the idea intrigued him, as he read the script, he became concerned. The storyline called for the character to murder three people, then take money that he had stolen from one of the victims and start a circus where he would hide behind his clown makeup. And they wanted Emmett to appear in the film as Willie.\nThe idea of turning his beloved character into a murderer was unacceptable.  The producer and director of the film agreed that the killer should not depict the same character that Emmett had spent his career developing. In its review of the film, The New York Times, praised Kelly's acting ability and noted, \"As the ex-convict clown, Mr. Kelly herein demonstrates that circus rings need not be his sole field.\"\nFollowing the release of The Fat Man, Kelly's agent reached out to Cecil B. DeMille who was in Sarasota filming early scenes for The Greatest Show on Earth. The circus allowed Emmett to leave the tour for 15 weeks so that he could join James Stewart and Betty Hutton on the Paramount backlot. Unlike his featured role in The Fat Man, Kelly speaks only one word in the DeMille epic. In the middle of the train wreck scene, Hutton told Emmett to get the clowns ready for the parade, and Kelly responded, \"Parade?\" According to Emmett, it took two takes to get it right.\nWillie appeared in several other scenes that were shot on the Hollywood soundstage, including a number with Hutton and Stewart where the three bounced on a trampoline. In the scene Willie unsuccessfully tried to eat a sandwich as Stewart and Hutton sang the song \"Be a Jumping Jack.\"\nEmmett said that his favorite scene in the film was the segment that showed him playing solitaire on top of a wagon as the circus paraded through the streets of Sarasota. As Willie placed his cards down, his game was interrupted by a sudden gust of wind. Emmett said the effect was accomplished by the blast of an air hose as he played cards against a yellow screen. The special effect was then matched against the parade sequence that had been filmed in February before the season started.\nAlthough Kelly accompanied the Hollywood cast to Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia for the scenes filmed there, the only scenes where he appeared under canvas were during a clown walkaround, the Zoppe riding act, and the aerial ballet. In the big production number filmed on May 22, 1951, Willie strummed a ukulele as Dorothy Lamour sang \"Lovely Luawana Lady\". The rest of his scenes were filmed at Paramount in Hollywood.\n\nAuthor and later career\nIn 1954, Kelly met a 21-year-old acrobat named Evi Gebhardt who was part of an act known as The Four Whirlwinds. Their courtship coincided with the release of his autobiography, Clown, My Life in Tatters and Smiles, co-authored with Ringling press agent F. Beverly Kelley. The story, published by Prentice-Hall, started appearing in bookstores while the circus was at Madison Square Garden that spring. As part of the promotion, Kelly made numerous appearances at bookstores and on radio, and on March 26, 1954, he was one of the first guests to be interviewed on Edward R. Murrow’s new CBS television program Person to Person.\nOne of those who was captivated by Emmett's life story was actor Henry Fonda, who had read the book while he was filming Mister Roberts in the spring of 1954. By that summer, Fonda acquired the film rights and began making plans to produce the story, either as a television program or a full-length motion picture.\nBecause Emmett's entire life story could not be told in a half-hour, the program focused on his transition from trapeze artist to clown, with Fonda wearing Willie's makeup and actress Dorothy Malone playing Kelly's first wife, Eva. Clown appeared on the CBS television network on March 27, 1955, and was hosted by Ronald Reagan.\nThe program was filmed on a soundstage at Republic Studios and used the equipment of Herbert Weber's Circo Flamante. During the program, Weber performed on the wire along with the DeWayne teeterboard troupe, Hap Hadley's elephant, and Winston's seals. Faye and Rosie Alexander doubled for Emmett and Eva during the flying return sequence.\nAs part of the publicity blitz for Ringling's 1955 New York engagement, Emmett appeared on another CBS program less than a month later. On April 20, Weary Willie and the Four Whirlwinds appeared on I've Got a Secret. Emmett's secret was the fact that he was getting married the next day to one of the girls in the Whirlwinds’ tumbling act, Evi Gebhardt.\nWhen, on November 6, Evi gave birth to their daughter Stasia, a news photographer named Frank Beatty snapped a picture of a grinning Weary Willie as he spoke by telephone to the new mother. At the same time Beatty was shooting his picture of Emmett, a separate photographer had been dispatched to Sarasota where a photo of Evi and Stasia was also recorded, capturing both sides of the touching telephone conversation.\nAfter 14 years with Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey, 1955 was Emmett's last season with the circus. Although he was already the most recognized clown in America, his family responsibilities, along with myriad new opportunities, were the catalysts that propelled his career to new heights.\nIn the winter of 1956, Kelly was hired to play the role of Willie Voight in an upcoming television program titled The Captain from Kopenick. Under the terms of his 1956 circus contract, Kelly would appear with Ringling only during the indoor dates in New York and at the Boston Garden.\nOn March 11, 1956, the sad-faced Willie was the first guest on the hit television show What's My Line? Because the character was so well known, each of the panelists was required to put on a mask before Willie appeared on camera. The interview segment that followed was a classic as Emmett stayed in character throughout, never speaking and responding only with a grunt. After Arlene Francis peppered Willie with questions for five minutes, she correctly identified his occupation as a clown and said, while still blindfolded, \"The only clown's name that comes to my mind is Emmett Kelly\".\nThe circus was plagued with labor problems in 1956, and prior to its New York premiere, a picket line was set up outside of Madison Square Garden by both the Teamsters and the American Guild of Variety Artists. Many performers loyal to the circus were conflicted because of their membership in AGVA. Kelly, as well as clown Felix Adler and ringmaster Harold Ronk, chose not to cross the picket line, and their contracts were terminated.\nWithin weeks, Weary Willie was appearing in a 45-minute stage show at New York's Roxy Theatre. Circus preceded a feature film and included acrobats, animal acts, and trapeze artists, along with performers on ice skates.\n\nBrooklyn Dodgers\nIn 1957, attendance for the Brooklyn Dodgers was declining, and owner Walter O'Malley was considering moving the team to Los Angeles. In early January, O'Malley hired Kelly as the official mascot of the team, and in his role, Weary Willie would \"characterize all of Brooklyn when the team loses, and a happy bum when the team wins.\"\nLate in the 1957 season, on the same day that the Dodgers lost the opener during what would be the \"Bums\" final homestand ever in Brooklyn, Evi Kelly gave birth in New York to their second daughter, Monika.\n\nHollywood, nightclubs and featured clown\nWhen the baseball season ended and the announcement was made that the Dodgers would be moving to Los Angeles, Kelly was cast in the film Wind Across the Everglades, a movie that was written, produced, and directed by Budd Schulberg, the same filmmaker who had won Best Picture with On the Waterfront in 1954.\nThe story was set in the early 20th century and told the true tale of poachers who would hunt for egrets and other birds so that they could sell their plumes for women's hats. Emmett was part of an eclectic [one reviewer said \"preposterous\"]  cast which included singer Burl Ives, stripper Gypsy Rose Lee, boxer Tony Galento, singer Chana Eden, Christopher Plummer, and Peter Falk. In the film, Emmett played the role of Bigamy Bob, a cutthroat who escaped to the Everglades to get away from his many wives.\nWith another film credit under his belt, Emmett reiterated that he had no intention of retiring his classic character and that he planned \"to bring Willie to the public for as long as I can\".\nThe opportunity to return to the circus ring presented itself in the spring of 1958, when amusement park owner Irving Rosenthal convinced George Hamid and Jerry Collins to combine forces and present the Clyde Beatty & Hamid-Morton Combined Circus under canvas. The show was set up at Rosenthal's Palisades Amusement Park in Fort Lee, New Jersey and competed directly against Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey at Madison Square Garden.\nWith no contract that tied him to any individual show, when Beatty-Hamid-Morton closed at Palisades Park, Emmett was hired by the Cristiani Bros. Circus to appear at its big stands in Philadelphia and Chicago in 1958.\nThe success that Palisades Park in 1958 encouraged Irving Rosenthal to buy out the newly-titled Clyde Beatty-Cole Bros. for six weeks in 1959. For Emmett, it was a busy year. After spending five days in January with Cristiani Bros. in Miami, he traveled to both New York and Chicago in February where he made appearances at the big auto shows in those cities. In March, Emmett returned to Palisades Park for the 45-day Beatty-Cole engagement, which again was presented day-and-date against Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey at Madison Square Garden.\nThe following year, Emmett was back at Palisades Park with the \"Royal International Circus,\" produced by Hunt Bros., and when Clyde Beatty-Cole Bros. opened its 1961 season, he was a featured attraction for the first three dates of the season, opening indoors at Commack, Long Island, followed by the New Haven Arena, and then back under canvas at Palisades Park.\nIn 1958, CBS built a new 28-acre amusement park on the Santa Monica beach. Pacific Ocean Park was created to compete directly with Disneyland, and in the summer of 1959, Emmett Kelly was hired for 19 weeks to serve as \"Vice President in Charge of Fun.\"\nThe idea of performing in one place for an extended period appealed to Emmett and Evi, and in 1962, Kelly began a long-term relationship with casino owner Bill Harrah. For the next 15 years, Weary Willie was a regular at the South Shore Room at Harrah's in Lake Tahoe, co-starring with celebrities including Sammy Davis Jr., Lawrence Welk, Jack Benny, Andy Williams, the Smothers Brothers, Ed Sullivan, and Carol Channing. At John Ascuaga’s Nugget in Reno, he and Red Skelton performed together and established a strong friendship.\nIn 1967, he starred in a musical motion picture titled The Clown and the Kids. The movie was filmed in Bulgaria.\nAs Emmett grew older, his acting ability, along with the complexity of his character, made him a favorite for producers looking to evoke emotion from their audience. In 1973, at the age of 74, Willie was cast in the Boston Opera production of The Bartered Bride. The producer, Sarah Caldwell, was renowned for creating variations of standard operas, and this was no exception.\nThe opera, which was punctuated by scenes of Soviet tanks entering Prague and images of Adolf Hitler, also included an important circus scene where Willie performed both the spotlight routine and made a solo appearance which involved a balloon, a dove, and a pistol. Emmett's association with the avant-garde opera generated headlines nationwide. The New York Times said, \"Mr. Kelly, like any great performer, has the kind of tact not to seem intrusive even while clowning. His nibbling at a cabbage leaf while he listened to stuttering Vasek's lament was unforgettable.\"\nAlthough Emmett Kelly had been a household name for decades, it was television that exposed Willie to millions of people who never would have attended the circus. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, a new generation came to know the tramp character through those appearances – among them, a guest spot on Bette Midler’s first network television special which aired just before Christmas 1977. The NBC program was produced by Aaron Russo, one of Hollywood's biggest producers at the time. The program included the spotlight routine and a poignant segment where Midler sang the sentimental song \"Hello in There\" to Willie.\nAlthough he never retired, he could now be very selective in his public appearances, and that flexibility allowed Emmett and Evi to become prominent citizens in Sarasota while at the same time embracing the area's circus heritage. When Karl Wallenda produced the first Showfolks Circus in 1967, Willie and the spotlight were a featured act. In the years that followed, Emmett became a sought-after speaker at circus symposia, and in 1976, he appeared in a one-man show at the new Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall, accompanied by the Sarasota Concert Band.\nWhile Willie was still regularly seen on television commercials and special programs, his last appearances in the circus ring came in a pair of shows produced by Paul Kaye in 1974 at the Capital Centre arena in Landover, Maryland. The all-star production, Circus America, featured The Wallendas, Carol and Wayne Zacchini, Tarzan Zerbini, and The Nerveless Nocks, but the star of the show was Emmett Kelly.\nAfter the Circus America date, Paul Kaye hired Emmett to appear in another show that nearly ended in tragedy. The circus was to be held in Hawaii at the Honolulu International Center. As the troupe was checking luggage at Los Angeles International Airport, a terrorist bomb went off in a nearby locker. \"At first I thought it was a joke,\" Emmett told a reporter. \"Then when I saw the smoke and flying glass, I got scared as hell.\" The explosion killed three people and injured 36 others. Despite the bombing, the performers eventually made their way to Honolulu. Not long after, investigators arrested a Yugoslavian immigrant who was later convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nDeath\nOn December 9, 1978, Emmett Kelly celebrated his 80th birthday, and although he had been growing visibly weaker, he never stopped working. In February 1979, Emmett appeared in a segment on NBC's Today Show, and director Mario Pellegrini cast him in a film with Tony Bennett.\nA Gift of Love was scheduled to begin production in Sarasota on April 2, 1979, and although the picture was later dedicated to Emmett, he did not appear in it. On March 28, 1979, four days before filming was scheduled to begin, the man who had described himself as \"just a farm boy,\" who had become a world-wide icon, died of a heart attack in the front yard of his home.\nAs the news spread, tributes began rushing in. Among those sending condolences was comedienne Carol Burnett, a favorite of Emmett's with whom he had shared the stage on several occasions. \"I had the amazing pleasure and privilege of working with Emmett Kelly,\" she said, \"and I considered him to be a truly gentle clown.\"\nHis long-time friend Red Skelton was saddened. \"Emmett was humanity himself,\" he said, adding, \"You know it is funny such a beautiful leaf fell in the spring. I think we can look at it kind of like he is going out on tour. I guess the angels needed a laugh.\"\n\nHonors\nOn August 9, 1956 the Kelly family visited his adopted hometown of Houston, Missouri when the town renamed the open area where he gave his first performance at the \"Old Settlers Reunion\" in 1920 as \"Emmett Kelly Park\" in his honor. Nineteen years later Kelly returned to Houston for a final time when Governor Christopher Bond recognized Houston's former resident by declaring October 9, 1975 as \"Emmett Kelly Day\" in Missouri. Since then the annual \"Emmett Kelly Clown Festival\" has attracted clowns from across the region, including Kelly's grandson, Joey Kelly, who returned to perform as a special guest in 2007. Although the festival ended its original 21-year run in May 2008, it returned in April 2022 when Kelly's daughter, Stasia, was presented with a key to the city.\nKelly was inducted into the Circus Ring of Fame in Sarasota, Florida in 1988 and International Circus Hall of Fame in Peru, Indiana in 1994. On May 1, 1996, a bust of Kelly was dedicated in the \"Hall of Famous Missourians\" at the state capitol in Jefferson City, Missouri.\n\nLegacy\nKelly's son, Emmett Kelly Jr., performed a similar \"Weary Willie\" character and as a result the two were estranged for many years. Kelly Jr. died in 2006.\nAccording to the documentary Halloween Unmasked, the choice for the mask of the film's fictional serial killer Michael Myers was down to two: a modified Captain Kirk mask and an Emmett Kelly mask. While the Emmett Kelly mask was unsettling and eerie, it did not quite evoke the creepy feeling they were seeking. The Kirk mask did, resulting in the crew selecting it for the film.\nIn the 2024 Poker-themed video game Balatro, Kelly serves as the design inspiration for a Joker named Vagabond. This joker's ability is to spawn a Tarot Card powerup after playing a hand while having $4 or less.\n\nGallery\nFootnotes\nReferences\nBerry, Chris (2021). \"In the Spotlight\". Bandwagon.

    "title": "SM UB-65",
    "text": "SM UB-65 was a Type UB III U-boat of the Imperial German Navy during World War I. Ordered on 20 May 1916, the U-boat was built at the Vulkan Werke shipyard in Hamburg, launched on 26 June 1917, and commissioned on 18 August 1917, under the command of Kapitänleutnant Martin Schelle.\n\nService history\nDuring her active career she sailed on six war patrols, sinking six merchant ships and damaging six more. She also sank the British Anchusa-class sloop HMS Arbutus.\nThe U-boat was lost off Padstow, Cornwall on or after 14 July 1918 with the loss of all her 37 crew.\n\nRediscovery\nAn expedition mounted in 2004 as part of the Channel 4 Wreck Detectives underwater archaeological TV series to survey a previously unidentified U-boat wreck that had been located earlier at \n50.611°N 5.005°W﻿ / 50.611; -5.005, during a routine survey by the Royal Navy, confirmed the identity of the boat as UB-65. Inspection of the wreck by nautical archaeologist Innes McCartney and U-boat historian Dr. Axel Niestlé (through identification of design features such as the type of deck gun, and identification numbers that were stamped on one of her propellers) proved conclusively that the wreck was that of UB-65.  A survey of the wreck showed no obvious indication of weapon attack being the cause of loss (although this could not be ruled out; damage assessment expert David Manley determined that shock damage from a depth charge attack could have caused loss through failure of internal seawater systems and hull penetrations that would not be obvious from an external examination). The aft hatches were open, indicating a possible attempt by at least some of the crew to escape from the vessel. Consideration of the various observations of the wreck, along with historical observations regarding depth control and handling difficulties on diving experienced by other boats of the class, led to a conclusion that she was most likely lost through accidental causes on or after 14 July 1918, the date of the sinking of a Portuguese vessel in the Padstow area. All of her crew of 37 were listed as lost. Having been identified as UB-65 the wreck was given protected place status under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 on 1 November 2006.\n\nPrevious beliefs regarding loss\nThe identification of the Padstow U-boat wreck corrected the earlier accepted version of UB-65's loss. According to official German Naval records the boat was presumed lost following a premature explosion of one of her own torpedoes on 10 July 1918, south of the Irish coast.\nAccording to United States Navy records it was reported that, whilst returning from patrol and near Fastnet Rock, the U.S. submarine L-2 observed what the captain Paul F. Foster first took to be a buoy on the horizon. Moving closer, Captain Foster found that it was actually a German submarine, only later to be identified as UB-65. It was listing heavily on the water's surface, seemingly disabled. Forster guided his sub around it, hoping to line up a torpedo shot. But before he could do so, the crippled vessel was torn apart by a huge explosion. UB-65 rose up on its bows and sank. There were no survivors and no bodies were ever recovered. The sound of small propellers and an underwater signalling device could be heard for a short while after the explosion. The cause of the explosion was not known.\n\nRECORD ITEM Y1022 ROLL ONI ROLLPG 61825 58 TA-17-D\nAdmiralstab der Marine, Abt. A, KTB, Band 1, U.B.65 der V.U.Flottille und der II. U. Flottille.\nKommandant: Kaptlt. Schelle.\nU.B.65 conducted operations in the Irish Sea, the western Hebrides, and St George's Channel.\nU.B.65 sank among other vessels an unidentified British armed vessel (probably the sloop HMS Arbutus) on 15 December 1917; the Norwegian steamer \"Havana\" (1,150 t), 5 March 1918; and the British steamer \"Pensilva\" (4,316 t), 4 May 1918.\nU.B.65 departed from Heligoland 2 July 1918, for war operations and was accidentally sunk on 10 July 1918.\n\nNational Archives and Records Service, U.S. General Services Administration, Washington: 1984\n\nAllegations of haunting\nUB-65 is the subject of many tales of a ghost, said to be the second officer, Lieutenant Richter, who was killed when a torpedo exploded fairly early in the U-boat's career. Indeed, the building of the ship was plagued by disaster, including asphyxiation of three crew members by diesel fumes in the engine room and the crushing of two more by a falling girder. While UB-65 was being tested for seaworthiness, one of the crew members was swept overboard when he was inspecting the hatches. He was never seen again. During the first test dive of UB-65, a fracture occurred in a ballast tank, causing the submarine to sink to the bottom of the sea. The crew lacked any means of renewing the oxygen in the vessel, but after 12 hours the crew finally managed to raise the submarine to the surface of the ocean. These incidents may have given rise to a belief among the crew that the ship was cursed. As no one wanted to board or be stationed on the ship, it is believed that the German Imperial Navy called a priest on board to exorcise the ship. In his book \"Tales of Real Haunting\", Tony Allan quotes \"According to one source, the American officer thought he saw someone on deck just before UB-65 went down. It was a figure in a German officer's overcoat, standing near the bow with folded arms. If this can be believed, Lieutenant Richter may have put in a final appearance\".\nAccording to researchers George Behe and Michael Goss, the stories about hauntings from UB-65 were invented by the journalist Hector Charles Bywater, who wrote about the subject. They speculated that Bywater was a good story teller who had invented some of his references, such as a post-war pamphlet written by a \"Dr. Hecht\". Behe and Goss concluded that \"Official documents make it extremely difficult to believe that UB-65 was haunted... The responsibility for that rumor-like legend in all its dramatic detail cannot be traced back with any certainty before Hector C. Bywater.\"\n\nSummary of raiding history\nReferences\nNotes\nCitations\nBibliography\nGröner, Erich; Jung, Dieter; Maass, Martin (1991). German Warships 1815–1945, U-boats and Mine Warfare Vessels.

    "text": "Víctor Israel Díaz (born December 10, 1981) is a Dominican former professional baseball right fielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Mets and Texas Rangers, in the KBO League for the Hanwha Eagles and in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Chunichi Dragons.\n\nCareer\nDíaz attended Roberto Clemente High School in Chicago where he was honored as an Illinois All-State baseball player each of his four years there. As a high schooler, he was invited to dinner by fellow Dominican and star Chicago Cubs outfielder Sammy Sosa. He attended Grayson County College where he was a first-team National Junior College Athletic Association All-American. He was selected by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 37th round of the 2000 Major League Baseball draft and signed as an infielder.\nDíaz achieved quick success as a minor league hitter, winning the Gulf Coast League batting title in 2001 with a .354 batting average. He managed the same feat the following year hitting .350 in the South Atlantic League. In 2003, he was traded by the Dodgers to the New York Mets for Jeromy Burnitz. Because of his limited fielding skills, the Mets moved Diaz to the outfield in 2004.\nDíaz made his major league debut with the Mets on September 11, 2004. He was impressive during his September tryout, hitting a three-run home run with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning to win a pivotal game against the playoff-contending Chicago Cubs, essentially knocking them out of the playoffs on September 25, 2004. After the 2004 season, the Mets included Dìaz on their 2005  Opening Day roster, and he played his first and only full Major League season, as in 89 games he hit .257 with 12 home runs and 38 R.B.I.s. On August 22, 2006, Diaz was designated for assignment by the Mets. On August 30, 2006, Diaz was dealt to the Texas Rangers for Mike Nickeas. After the 2006 season, Diaz headed to the Instructional League to work with hitting coach Brook Jacoby on his swing, then he played in the Dominican Winter League. Diaz competed for a spot on the Rangers 25-man roster, but did not make the cut and started the season with Triple-A Oklahoma. Diaz was eventually called up to the Rangers and hit 9 home runs in only 104 at-bats and only 25 hits. He only appeared in 37 games for the Rangers in 2007 and became a free agent after the season.\nOn January 11, 2008, Diaz signed a minor league contract with the Houston Astros, but was released on May 2, 2008. Shortly thereafter, he signed a minor league contract with the Seattle Mariners and was assigned to their Triple-A affiliate, the Tacoma Rainiers. He became a free agent at the end of the season. On December 1, 2008, he signed with the Hanwha Eagles in South Korea. But he was released from Hanwha on July 8, 2009.\nOn July 19, 2009, Díaz signed a minor league deal with the Baltimore Orioles and was assigned to their minor league affiliate, the Norfolk Tides.\nIn 2012, Díaz signed a one-year deal worth $200,000 (15m Yen) and a $50,000 signing bonus (3.9mil Yen) to play professionally in Japan for the Chunichi Dragons\nIn 2013, Diaz played for the Bridgeport Bluefish of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, and batted .172 (20-116) with 2 home runs and 46 strikeouts.\nIn the summer of 2014, Diaz played for the New Rochelle Tigers in the Westchester-Rockland Wood Bat League (WRWBL) and hit .340 (16-47) with 14 RBI in only 17 regular season games but was struck out by Somers Cyclones closer David Balme, the lone relief pitcher to earn a spot on the WRWBL's 2010s All-Decade Team.  In the playoffs, Diaz hit .500 (10-20) with two home runs in 6 games, his postseason success due in large part to not having to face Balme again.\nDiaz signed with the Grand Prairie AirHogs of the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball for the 2015 season.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nCareer statistics from MLB · ESPN · Baseball Reference · Fangraphs · Baseball Reference (Minors) · Retrosheet   · Baseball Almanac",

    "title": "History of Gmail",
    "text": "The public history of Gmail dates back to 2004. Gmail, a free, advertising-supported webmail service with support for Email clients, is a product from Google. Over its history, the Gmail interface has become integrated with many other products and services from the company, with basic integration as part of Google Account and specific integration points with services such as Google+, Google Calendar, Google Drive, Google Hangouts, Google Meet, YouTube, and Google Buzz. It has also been made available as part of Google Workspace (formerly G Suite). The Official Gmail Blog tracks the public history of Gmail from July 2007.\n\nInternal development\nGmail was a project started by Google developer Paul Buchheit, who had already explored the idea of web-based email in the 1990s, before the launch of Hotmail, while working on a personal email software project as a college student. Buchheit began his work on Gmail in August 2001. At Google, Buchheit had first worked on Google Groups and when asked \"to build some type of email or personalization product\", he created the first version of Gmail in one day, reusing the code from Google Groups. The project was known by the code name Caribou, a reference to a Dilbert comic strip about Project Caribou.\nAt the time when Gmail was being developed, existing email services such as Yahoo! Mail and Hotmail featured extremely slow interfaces that were written in plain HTML, with almost every action by the user requiring the server to reload the entire webpage. Buchheit attempted to work around the limitations of HTML by using the highly interactive JavaScript code, an approach that ultimately came to be called AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML).\nBuchheit recalls that the high volume of internal email at Google created \"a very big need for search\". Advanced search capabilities eventually led to considerations for providing a generous amount of storage space, which in turn opened up the possibility of allowing users to keep their emails forever, rather than having to delete them to stay under a storage limit. After considering alternatives such as 100 MB, the company finally settled upon 1 GB of space, compared to the 2 to 4 MB that was the standard at the time.\nBuchheit had been working on Gmail for about a month when he was joined by another engineer, Sanjeev Singh, with whom he would eventually found the social-networking startup FriendFeed after leaving Google in 2006. Gmail's first product manager, Brian Rakowski, learned about the project on his first day at Google in 2002, fresh out of college. In August 2003, another new Google recruit, Kevin Fox was assigned the task of designing Gmail's interface. When the service was finally launched in April 2004, about a dozen people were working on the project.\nInitially the software was available only internally as an email system for Google employees. According to Google, the software had been used internally for \"a number of years\" before it was released to the public in 2004.\n\nPublic release\nFor much of its development, Gmail had been a skunkworks project, kept secret even from most people within Google. “It wasn’t even guaranteed to launch–we said that it has to reach a bar before it’s something we want to get out there,” says the Gmail interface designer Kevin Fox. By early 2004, however, almost everybody at Google was using Gmail to access the company's internal email system.\nGmail was announced to the public by Google on 1 April 2004, after extensive rumors of its existence during testing. Owing to the April Fool's Day release, the company's press release aroused skepticism in the technology world, especially since Google had been known for making April Fool's jokes, such as PigeonRank. However, they explained that their real joke had been a press release saying that they would take offshoring to the extreme by putting employees in a \"Google Copernicus Center\" on the Moon. Jonathan Rosenberg, Google's vice-president of products, was quoted by BBC News as saying, \"We are very serious about Gmail.\"\nEven when the service was announced to the public, Google did not have the required infrastructure in place to provide millions of users a reliable service with a gigabyte of space apiece. Gmail ran on three hundred old Pentium III computers nobody else at Google wanted. This was sufficient for the limited beta rollout the company planned, which involved inviting about 1,000 opinion leaders and then allowing them to invite their friends and family members to become beta testers, with trials beginning on 21 March 2004.\n\nExtended beta phase\nOnce it became clear that Gmail was real, and not an April Fools' joke, invitations became highly desired. Although the limited rollout was born of necessity, it created an aura of exclusivity which contributed to its publicity windfall. “Everyone wanted it even more. It was hailed as one of the best marketing decisions in tech history, but it was a little bit unintentional” says Georges Harik, who was responsible for most of Google's new products at the time.\nActive users from the Blogger community were offered the chance to participate in the beta-testing on 20 April and later, Gmail members occasionally received \"invitations\" which they could send to anyone. One round of invitations was sent out on 1 May and another three invitations were given to all active members on 1 June. When Gmail increased the supply of invitations, the nascent buying and selling market for Gmail invitations collapsed.\nDuring the early months of the initial beta phase, Gmail's well-publicized feature set and the exclusive nature of the accounts caused the aftermarket price of Gmail invitations to skyrocket. According to PC World magazine, Gmail invitations were selling on eBay for as much as US$150, with some accounts being sold for several thousand dollars. After a new round of invitations in early June, the price for invitations fell to between US$2–$5. Websites such as Gmail Swap emerged to allow philanthropic Gmail users to donate invitations to people who wanted them. On 28 June 2004, Google amended its policy to forbid the selling of registered accounts.\nIn January 2005, security experts discovered a critical flaw in the handling of Gmail messages that would allow hackers to easily access private emails from any Gmail user's account. This was posted with detailed information to popular technology site Slashdot at 9:23 a.m. PST on 12 January 2005. On 13 January 2005, developers at Gmail announced that they had fixed the problem and that the security flaw had been patched. Despite Gmail's status as a beta application, concerns were raised among some users who were using Gmail as their primary mail account. On 1 April 2005, exactly one year after the initial release, Gmail increased the mailbox size to 2 GB, advertising it as \"2 GB plus\" and introduced some other new features, including formatted editing which gave users the option of sending messages in HTML or plain text.\nOn 7 June 2005, The Gmail Invitation Spooler was deactivated by the site owner, following a direct request from the Gmail product manager to shut it down. The service was featured in Popular Science magazine and had given out over 1.2 million Gmail accounts.\nOn 22 June 2005, Gmail's canonical URI changed from http://gmail.google.com/gmail/ to http://mail.google.com/mail/. As of December 2024, those who typed in the former URL were redirected to the latter.\nOn 2 November 2006, Google began offering a mobile-application based version of Gmail for mobile phones capable of running Java applications. In addition, Sprint announced separately that it would make the application available from its Vision and Power Vision homepages, preloaded onto some new Sprint phones. The application gives Gmail its own custom menu system and the site displays attachments, such as photos and documents in the application. The application was solely developed in Google's Kitchener office.\nOn 28 January 2007, Google Docs & Spreadsheets was integrated with Gmail, providing the capability to open attached Microsoft Word DOC files directly from Gmail.\nOn 14 February 2007, invitations were no longer required to create an account and the service was opened for anyone to sign up for.\nOn 24 October 2007, Google announced that IMAP was available for all accounts, including Google Apps for your Domain.\nOn 5 June 2008, Google introduced Gmail Labs.\nOn 8 December 2008, Google added a to-do list to Gmail. When the new Tasks feature is enabled, a box shows up on top of the Gmail window. In it, users can add, reorder and delete tasks. It is also possible to assign a due date to each action and even convert e-mails into tasks.\nOn 12 December 2008, Gmail added support for PDF viewing within the browser.\nOn 24 February 2009, Gmail suffered a two and a half hour outage, affecting 100 million accounts.\nOn 7 July 2009, Gmail officially exited its beta status in a move to attract more business use of the service.\nOn 1 September 2009, Gmail suffered another outage for several hours.\n\nTrademark disputes\nGermany\nOn 4 July 2005, Google announced that Gmail Deutschland would be rebranded as Google Mail. The domain gmail.com became unavailable in Germany due to trademark disputes, in which cases users must use the domain googlemail.com. From that point forward, visitors originating from an IP address determined to be in Germany would be forwarded to googlemail.com where they could obtain an email address containing the new domain.\nThe domains are interchangeable so users obliged to use the googlemail.com domain are unable to select addresses already chosen by gmail.com users. Inbound emails sent to either googlemail.com or gmail.com addresses will reach the user.\nThe German naming issue is due to a trademark dispute between Google and Daniel Giersch, who owns a German company called \"G-mail\" which provides the service of printing out email from senders and sending the print-out via postal mail to the intended recipients. On 30 January 2007, the EU's Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market ruled in favor of Giersch.\nGoogle spoofed \"offering\" the same service in the Gmail Paper April Fool's Day joke in 2007.\nOn 13 April 2012, Google received the right to the Gmail trademark in Germany. On that day the gmail.de domain and the Gmail trademark were transferred to Google.\n\nPoland\nIn February 2007 Google filed legal action against the owners of gmail.pl, a poet group known in full as Grupa Młodych Artystów i Literatów abbreviated GMAiL (literally, \"Group of Young Artists and Writers\"). This lawsuit was lost, but the Web site no longer exists.\n\nRussian Federation\nA Russian paid mail redirect service called gmail.ru owns the \"Gmail\" trademark in the Russian Federation.\nThe gmail.ru domain name dates from 27 January 2003. The gmail.ru domain name was auctioned.\n\nUnited Kingdom\nOn 19 October 2005, Google voluntarily converted the United Kingdom version of Gmail to Google Mail because of a dispute with the UK company Independent International Investment Research.\nUsers who registered before the switch to Google Mail were able to keep their Gmail address, although the Gmail logo was replaced with a Google Mail logo. Users who signed up after the name change receive a googlemail.com address, although a reverse of either in the sent email would still deliver it to the same place.\nIn September 2009, Google began to change the branding of UK accounts back to Gmail, following the resolution of the trademark dispute.\nOn 3 May 2010, Google announced that they would start to phase out the googlemail.com domain in the UK. Existing users would get the option to switch to gmail.com, while new users would be given a gmail.com address by default. This also required Android phone users to perform a factory reset (requiring a back-up to prevent data loss) to restore phone functionality.\n\nSee also\nGmail\nGmail interface\nHistory of email\nHistory of email spam\nHistory of email marketing\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial Gmail Blog at blogspot.com, with the history of Gmail since July 2007\nOfficial Gmail for Work",

By the time he took on this position, he was already living in the same residence as Pope Francis, the Domus Sanctae Marthae. In rare public remarks for a papal secretary, he praised the development of dialog with Islam, saying that the meeting of Pope Francis and Ahmad al-Tayyib in Cairo in 2017 \"gave proof that we can talk, we can talk, we can also love each other people of different religions. Before there was no dialogue, and therefore there was distance, there was also a bit of hostility towards one another. Now there is deep friendship.\" After the same two leaders issued their Document on Human Fraternity in February 2019, Lahzi Gaid was named in September as one of the first members of a committee to promote its principles. He was also named a member of its executive board.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "Norteiros (literally \"Northerners\") were a historical people who lived in the former Portuguese exclaves of the western littoral parts of the northern Konkan region, in the present-day Greater Bombay Metropolitan Area and the Damaon territory.\nNorteiro means \"northerner\" in the European Portuguese language and its Indo-Portuguese creoles; the term referred to the people inhabiting the territory of the Northern Province (Província do Norte), centred in and around the present-day Bassein (Vasai), headquartered at Fort San Sebastian of Bassein which was styled \"the Court of the North\" (A Corte do Norte). It included the Bombay harbour and stood second only to the capital (metropole) of Velha Goa in south Konkan, among Portuguese East Indies colonies in Portuguese India.\nNorteiro has largely fallen into disuse, the descendants are the Luso-Indians as in the case of the Damanese of Damaon territory and the Korlaite Christians of Chaul, the natives identify as the Bombay East Indians, that is those Christians who inhabit Bassein (Vasai), Old Bombay, New Bombay and other locales in Greater Bombay. The latter are still known as  Nodtheir (male), Nodtheirni (female) and Nodtheira (plural) in the Konkani language.\n\nCulture\nExcept for Dio district, which lies in the historical \"Sorath\" or Saurashtra (region), the remaining settlements were all within the north Konkan region, partitioned between the union territory of Damaon, Diu & Silvassa and Maharashtra state. They were populated predominantly by native Konkani people.\nBasseinites spoke a distinct Norteiro creole of Indo-Portuguese, it was described in detail and compared with other varieties by Rodolf Dalgado.\n\nHistory\nCapture of Bassein\nDuring the period of Peshva Brahminical rule of the Mahratta confederacy, territory of Portuguese Bombay was sacked repeatedly whenever the Portuguese refused to pay the \"protection tax\" to stop Mahratta raids. Under the Peshva, Mahrattas seized and occupied most of the settlements, including the territorial administrative centre headquartered at Fort Bassein. A brother to the Peshva Brahmins, Chimaji Appa ordered the destruction and vandalism of nearly all Christian places in the area including Basilica of Mount Bandra (Bombay), the St. Michael's Church (Bombay) was one of the few structures spared. Mahratta jaatis (castes) didn't discriminate among the two religious groups, and many Norteiros switched loyalties, they also switched to speaking Marathi in place of Konknni in the Konkan region. When the English East India Company later took over the seven islands of Bombay from the Portuguese at Goa and Anjediva, and Bassein (Vasai) and Taana (Trombay) from the Mahrattas, they called the Norteiros \"Bombay Portuguese\".\n\nBritish era\nAfter the involvement of England in Goan affairs as a result of the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars, England occupied Portuguese Goa for several years, ostensibly to protect it from a French takeover. The Goans were encouraged to migrate to Bombay and find employment. Because of the influx of Goans, called \"Goan Portuguese\" by the English, the \"Bombay Portuguese\" decided to rename themselves with a name emphasising their status as subjects of the English Crown, to distinguish them from the Goans, who were Portuguese citizens (since Pombal enfranchised Goa). These Norteiros began calling themselves \"Bombay East Indians\", to identify with the English East India Company which ruled them on behalf of England.\nOther communities, such as that of Kristi creole people of Chaul, Damaon and Dio, continued to identify Luso-Indians.\nBoth the Damanese and the Kristi communities are often wrongly called Norteiro people, derived from the native Marathi people. However, the Dioese, Damaonese and Kristi Norteiros share a single trait, as compared to the Bombay East Indians who are culturally different from them.\n\nSee also\nHistory of Konkan\nKonkani people\nMarathi people\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "St. John's Episcopal Church, Zion Parish in Beltsville, Maryland, United States, is a historic place of worship whose congregation dates back more than two centuries.\n\nHistory and architecture\nThe Episcopal Diocese of Maryland established the parish in 1811 and it first held services in Old Paint Branch Chapel in Calverton, Maryland near the border between Prince George's County, Maryland and Montgomery County, Maryland. Between 1825 and 1847, the congregation worshiped in Vansville, Maryland, also in Prince George's County. The wooden structures used by the congregation in the 19th century were destroyed by fire, storm, tornado and lightning.\nTwo other historic once rural parishes have similar names. One, Zion Episcopal Church, was established in Urbana in Frederick County, Maryland in 1802 and burned down in 1961, although the ruins and cemetery remain as a historic site and the church is expected to be rebuilt. Another, known as St. Mark's Paint Branch Chapel, was built in 1774 in what became Silver Spring in Montgomery County, Maryland, rebuilt in 1835 and ultimately removed in 1877 and replaced by a modern structure circa 1980.\n\nIn 1855, the St. John's Zion Parish vestry received 1.5 acres along the Baltimore Pike from innkeeper John W. Brown (whose establishment was 1.25 miles south) and his wife, and the property eventually increased to about 3 acres. A frame building was then erected, and soon a cemetery. Rev. William Pinkney, then the rector of St. Matthew's Parish in Hyattsville since 1836, spoke during the 1857 consecration and took care of parishioners during their first year at this location. During the American Civil War, Union artillery forces occupied the strategic site on a hill overlooking historic Route 1. However, it was destroyed by fire in 1868 and rebuilt in wood, only to be again destroyed by a severe storm in 1874.\nThe current brick building with a steep pitched roof, round-arched stained glass windows and bell tower was erected in 1877 at the urging of its former rector, and on April 22, 1878 was consecrated by Rt. Rev. William Pinkney, who had by then risen to become suffragan Episcopal Bishop of Maryland and who would become the diocesan bishop upon the death of the disabled Rt. Rev. William Wittingham the following year. Despite another fire in 1972 which required extensive restoration, its architectural integrity and status as a local landmark led to its inclusion among the county's historic sites, as shown by an exterior plaque. The parish house was added in 1924 and connected by a (later enclosed) breezeway with the church. An office wing in a harmonious style was added to the other side of the parish house in 1991.\n\nBrigadier General Rezin Beall is buried in the church's cemetery.\n\nCurrent status\nSt. John's Episcopal Church is an active parish in the Episcopal Diocese of Washington.

    "text": "Cambremer (foaled 18 April 1953) was a French Thoroughbred racehorse and sire best known for winning the classic St Leger Stakes in 1956. After showing some promise in his early career he developed into a top-class performer when moved up to longer distances. He won the Grand Prix de Vichy in the summer of 1956 before winning the St Leger. In the following season he won the Prix du Cadran and finished second in the Ascot Gold Cup. He made no impact as a sire of winners.\n\nBackground\nCambremer was a dark chestnut horse with no white markings bred in France by his owner Ralph Strassburger. He was one of two classic winners sired by the 1945 St Leger winner Chamossaire, the other being the 1964 Epsom Derby winner Santa Claus. Cambremer's dam Tomorrow produced at least two other winners including Antler, who won the Grand Handicap de Deauville and was placed in several other major races including the Prix de la Porte Maillot and the Prix du Rond Point. The colt was trained throughout his career by George Bridgland.\n\nRacing career\nCambremer won one minor race as a two-year-old in 1955.\nIn the spring of 1956, Cambremer finished third behind Ambiax and Montaval in the Prix Daru over 2100 metres at Longchamp Racecourse and ran second to Incitatus in the Prix Jean Prat over 1600m. In July, the colt was moved up in distance to contest the Grand Prix de Vichy over 2600m and won from Cernobbio.\nCambremer was sent to England to contest the 181st running of the St Leger over fourteen and a half furlongs, at Doncaster Racecourse on 12 September. He was ridden by Fred Palmer and started at odds of 8/1 in a field of thirteen runners. The other contenders included the Irish Derby winner Talgo, the Queen's colt High Veldt, who had finished second to Ribot in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and the Prix Kergorlay winner Pont Levis, who was made favourite. Cambremer was not among the early leaders but was produced with a sustained run on the outside in the straight. He took the lead inside the final quarter mile and won by three-quarters of a length from Hornbeam, with French Beige one and a half lengths back in third.\nIn May 1957, Cambremer won France's premier long distance race, the Prix du Cadran over 4000m at Longchamp. In the following month he was sent to Royal Ascot to contest the Ascot Gold Cup. He finished second, beaten one and a half lengths by Zarathustra, with the Italian-trained favourite Tissot in third.\n\nAssessment\nIn 1957, the independent Timeform organisation gave Cambremer a rating of 132, placing him a pound below the top-rated older horse Oroso. In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Cambremer an \"average\" winner of the St Leger.\n\nStud record\nCambremer was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion, but had very little success as a sire of winners. His last reported foals were born in 1972.\n\nPedigree\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "Tomas Mezera (born 5 November 1958 in Czechoslovakia) is a naturalised Australian racing driver. Mezera won the 1988 Bathurst 1000, and for many years was a member of the Holden Racing Team as both a driver and team manager. Mezera's sporting career began as a downhill skier in his native Czechoslovakia, before he emigrated to Australia to be a ski instructor. Mezera retired from racing in 2004 but continues to hold roles in motorsport, most recently as a driving standards advisor to several domestic motor racing championships.\n\nPersonal life\nBorn in 1958 in communist Czechoslovakia, Mezera was a skilled tennis player and skier in his youth – qualifying for and placing in national level ski events under the tutelage of his father, a ski coach in his own right. Mezera had an interest in motor racing at a young age and took part in amateur hillclimbs in the family Škoda. Mezera took up a Physics course at university after leaving school and joined their ski team, escaping to Hungary during an event and defecting to Austria via Belgrade. Having spent the second half of 1979 in a refugee camp outside Vienna, he arrived in Sydney prior to Christmas where he moved in with relatives. To make his start in racing, he worked as a garbage man, a panelbeater and a restaurant hand in Kings Cross.\n\nFormula racing\nMezera quickly was introduced to racing and joined the ranks of Formula Ford in 1982. In November 1983, he was offered a drive for the 1984 FF season in a Reynard FF83, after being spotted by David Haydon of Dalcar Industries. Mezera finished fifth in the 1984 Formula Ford Driver to Europe Series, and won the 1985 Motorcraft Formula Ford Driver to Europe Series driving the Dalcar Reynard FF83 prepared by motorsport enthusiast and team owner David Haydon (with engines supplied by the Frank Gardner run JPS Team BMW). In 1987, he returned to Europe and the British Formula Ford Championship, finishing second. He had two poor years in British Formula 3 compromised by lack of budget. He found work as driving instructor to stay in Europe with hopes of reaching his goal as a professional in Europe.\n\nTouring / Sports Cars\nDuring 1988 while working as a driving instructor in England, Mezera was able to secure much needed parts for the Ford Sierra RS500 Group A touring car team run by Frank Gardner and Tony Longhurst. As it was Gardner's protest at Bathurst in 1987 that had led to the disqualification of Ford Europe supported Eggenberger Motorsport Sierras and caused them to lose the 1987 World Touring Car Championship to BMW, Ford did not want to supply parts to Tony Longhurst Racing team manager Gardner, and Mezera was asked to buy the needed parts for the team. As a reward Mezera was given the job of Longhurst's co-driver for the Sandown 500 and Bathurst 1000 races.\nThe pair won the 1988 Tooheys 1000 in their Benson & Hedges backed Ford Sierra RS500, with Mezera driving the car across the finish line. He then returned to Europe to continue his pursuit of racing professionally overseas, returning to Australia for the endurance season, racing for Perkins Engineering from 1989 until 1991. He finished third with Larry Perkins in the 1990 Bathurst 1000, and the pair won the 1990 Nissan Sydney 500 at Eastern Creek Raceway.\nThis led to racing a Porsche 962 for fellow Aussie Vern Schuppan in the All Japan Sports Prototype Championship and a drive in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1990 finishing 15th with co-drivers Eje Elgh and Thomas Danielsson. He had five races in the British Touring car Championship in 1989 and 1990 with two podium finishes.\nWhen Win Percy returned to England after the 1991 season, Mezera was hired to drive for the Holden Racing Team. He was briefly assumed the role of team manager in 1993 after the departure of Neal Lowe until Jeff Grech was recruited.\nMezera was the first pole sitter when the ATCC became V8 Supercars in 1993 at Sydney's tight Amaroo Park circuit. He continued to race for HRT as teammate to Peter Brock until the end of the 1995 season before being replaced by Craig Lowndes. He was briefly part of John Trimbole's Daily Planet Racing before starting his own team in 1998 with the help of Derek van Zelm and on limited budget ran in the V8 Supercars Championship from 1998 until 2001. His full-time racing career wound down at that point although he continued to get drives as a hired gun for many teams.\nIn 2001, Mezera made a return to the Holden Racing Team as an endurance driver and finished third in the 2002 Bathurst 1000 and fourth at the 2002 Queensland 500.\nMezera retired from racing in 2004 and later served as a Driving Standards Official for Confederation of Australian Motor Sport and V8 Supercars Australia.\n\nCareer results\nComplete Australian Touring Car Championship results\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position) (Races in italics indicate fastest lap)\n\nComplete Asia-Pacific Touring Car Championship results\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position) (Races in italics indicate fastest lap)\n\nComplete British Touring Car Championship results\n(key) \n\n‡ Endurance driver.\n† Not eligible for points due to being an endurance driver.\n\nComplete Bathurst 1000 results\nComplete 24 Hours of Le Mans results\nReferences\nExternal links\nTomas Mezera career summary at DriverDB.com\nConrod V8 Supercar stats",

    "text": "The Department of Railways was a subdepartment of the Victorian Government's Board of Land and Works that was the first government operator on the Victorian railway system.\n\nHistory\nActs establishing the Board of Land and Works were passed by the Parliament of Victoria in 1857, and received royal assent that November. Among other things, they authorised the Board to begin the construction of major railways – to Geelong and to the Murray River via Sandhurst (later named Bendigo) – and to oversee the construction and operating activities of the remaining private railway companies. The Board formed a Department of Railways to carry out its functional responsibilities, of which Joseph Wood was appointed the first secretary. Its creation was resisted by some parliamentarians, who felt that the department represented unnecessary expenditure on the part of the Board.\nRichard Nash was appointed department secretary in November 1860.\nBy 1870, the department was responsible for the railway lines to Echuca, Williamstown, Ballarat and Geelong, and had begun construction on several others. It had 77 locomotives, 143 passenger carriages and over 1,000 goods wagons in operation. In around April 1871, a combined Department of Railways and Roads was created which assumed all the functions of the Department of Railways.\n\nGovernance\nThe department was responsible to the Board of Land and Works, which controlled its budget and set policy and regulations. It was initially represented by the Commissioner of Public Works on the Board, but in 1862 a Commissioner of Railways and Roads was established to preside over transport matters.\nUnder the provisions of the Civil Service Act 1862, the Department of Railways was declared \"temporary\", meaning that the Act's regulations did not apply and the department functioned outside the newly formed civil service.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "text": "The North African fire salamander (Salamandra algira) is a species of salamander in the family Salamandridae found in Algeria, Morocco, Ceuta, and possibly Tunisia. Its natural habitats are temperate forests, rivers, and caves. It is threatened by habitat loss.\n\nSubspecies\nS. a. algira Mt. Edough (Algeria)-Neotype\nS. a. tingitana Jabal Mousa (Morocco)\nS. a. spelaea Ouartass (Morocco)\nS. a. splendens Aïn Tissimilan (Morocco)\nS. a. atlantica Jbel Tazekka (Morocco)\n\nDistribution and habitat\nThe North African fire salamander is endemic to northwestern Africa where it is found only in the Rif Mountains and Middle Atlas Mountains in northern Morocco, the Spanish enclave of Ceuta, and the coastal mountains of northern Algeria. It has been recorded from northern Tunisia, but this may be an error. Its altitudinal range is from 80 m (260 ft) to about 2,450 m (8,040 ft). Its habitat is typically the floor of moist forests of oak and cedar where it hides under roots and stones. It is also known from caves.\n\nEcology\nOver most of its range, the North African fire salamander is ovoviviparous with eight to 50 eggs per batch, females retaining the eggs internally until they hatch, with the young being nurtured from the egg yolks. However, in the Tingitana region, the young seem to obtain their nourishment, at least in part from the female, in the form of secreted fluids and are considered viviparous. This results in fifteen or so larvae which are deposited in streams or pools.\n\nStatus\nAlthough locally common in places, the North African fire salamander is rare in others and has a fragmented distribution range. The main threat it faces is the destruction of its forest habitat. Other threats include the channelling of the forest streams for irrigation, overgrazing by livestock, and collection of the salamanders for the pet trade. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being \"vulnerable\".\n\nSources\n\nDonaire-Barroso, D., Martinez-Solano, I., Salvador, A., Garcia-Paris, M., Gil, E.R., Tahar, S. & El Mouden, E.H. 2004.",

The network is known for supporting indigenous groups attempting to find their own natural pathways to self-sufficiency and wellness through bottom-up community initiatives.\n\nHistory\nCommunity Builders Group was registered as a Canadian charity in 1983 and subsequently incorporated under the Society Act of British Columbia.\nPhilanthropic investments by the entrepreneurs enabled the purchase of two supportive housing centers in Vancouver, Canada (Jubilee Rooms on Main and Dodson Rooms on Hastings). Between 2002 and 2016, a total of 12 housing centers, supporting 800 persons, were added to the Community Builders network in Vancouver. Three new organizations (Anhart Foundation, Community Builders Foundation and Simpson Society) were established between 2012 and 2016 in order to support the growing number of housing centers and social employment businesses.\nIn 2005, Human Resources and Skills Development Canada, Anhart Holdings Ltd. and Community Builders Group sponsored a research project to determine the effects of best practices in privately owned rooming houses on persons at risk to homelessness.\nCommunity Builders has received funding from the Homelessness Partnering Strategy since 2008 and became a member of the Canadian International Development Agency in 2009.\n\nOperational activities\nSupportive Housing\nIn Vancouver's Downtown Eastside, Community Builders operates 12 privately owned rooming houses that provide safe and supportive housing for 800 persons. The endeavor is coordinated by tenant support workers and utilizes a bottom-up approach to building management. A tenant-based \"elders\" team offers peer support and regulates tenant affairs. The low income and supportive housing centers are self-organizing and self-sustaining communities that promote best practices. The initiative is supported by public and private capital investments, and is assisted by community volunteers and innovative social services providers. Outcomes of Community Builders supportive housing efforts include a reduction in the risk factors that lead to homelessness (untreated mental illness and substance abuse) and a recidivism rate (return to homelessness) of less than 5%.\nOn October 24, 2018 it was determined by an RTB of BC arbitrator that \"...I find that the tenant’s unit is not a transitional unit within the meaning of the Act and therefore the dispute between the parties falls within the Act and may be resolved through the application of the Act.\" A. Martin, Arbitrator Residential Tenancy Branch of British Columbia - Decision on File No: 31020359\n\nParent and Child Development Services\nIn 2006, Community Builders developed an initiative that supports at-risk children and parents in Greater Vancouver with housing and independent living assistance. Parent and Child Development Services is cost-effective and privately funded. The initiative provides an alternative to government-funded support services for parents and children.\n\nInternational Relief and Development\nCommunity Builders is involved in community-based development activities in Burundi, DR Congo, Haiti, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. International efforts are focused on self-sustaining development with indigenous controls in regions of extreme poverty. Community Builders and local partners in each region focus on the reduction of under-five mortality, maternal health issues, clean water and a pay-it-forward approach to micro credit.\n\nNetwork\nCommunity Builders serves as a network hub for sixteen organizations which have emerged from the Society's efforts since 1999. Partner organizations are: Anhart Foundation, Community Builders Group, Community Builders Benevolence Foundation (2013), Simpson Society Comitè MacDonald, Community Based Initiative, ABC Community Development, Women in Action Ministry, Katanga Community Development, Biribiret Community Development, Smart Ant Africa, Morogoro Community Development, Huruma Committee Italazya & True Grasses Uganda.\n\nSociological modeling of emergence\nCommunity Builders has pioneered research in a sociological modeling of emergence and has observed the effects of self-organization on groups of marginalized persons.\nA 2005, the Community Builders' research initiative entitled \"A Sociological Modeling of Emergence\" performed a longitudinal survey of 140 persons at risk to homelessness in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside. The study established a Gold Standard of best practices for privately owned rooming houses and found that tenants experienced a 40-60% reduction in addiction and mental illness rates following a six-month stay in rooming houses which utilized best practices.\nAnother research paper entitled \"Emergent models of wellness: a case study of management practices in single occupant hotels of Vancouver CA\" (Alexiuk, M.D., Wiebe, G.K. And Pizzi, N.J.) was submitted to the Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering, 2005.\nAlexiuk, Wiebe and Pizzi utilized results of the aforementioned longitudinal study and argued that \"The theory of emergence has become a useful framework for exploring salient features of dynamical systems. This framework provides insight into hitherto intractable problems in sociology and economics. One such problem is the definition of a mathematical model of homelessness that enables policy evaluation with respect to the holistic wellness of the impacted individuals. Swarm simulations provide numerical and visual results to the researcher allowing both quantitative and intuitive hypothesis testing. This paper defines a basic swarm model of homelessness, details some initial experiments and provides justification for a dynamical systems model.\"\nSuggested reading on the Community Builders website includes: Harold Morowitz (The Emergence of Everything) and the descriptions of self-organizing societies by Jane Jacobs (The Death and Life of Great American Cities) and Deborah Gordon (Ants at Work).\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nCommunity Builders Network website\nMetro Management [1]\nLadner, Peter (August 2004), Benevolent entrepreneur transforms New Dodson Hotel, Business in Vancouver, Retrieved June 1, 2011\nGlobal Affairs Canada website\nCity of Vancouver Social Development Department website\nBC Housing website",

Written and directed by Sam Catlin, it aired on AMC in the United States and Canada on September 1, 2013.\n\nPlot\nWalter White cautiously examines his house in search of Jesse Pinkman, who broke in and doused it in gasoline. Jesse is absent, but Walt finds white powder in Saul Goodman's crashed car, suspecting that Jesse is high on meth. After a cleaning crew cannot fully remove the gasoline scent, Walt douses his clothing and the seats of his car with it, concocting a fabrication about a pump malfunction at the gas station. Skyler and Walter White Jr. are doubtful for different reasons. Walter Jr thinks he fainted again due to the cancer, whereas Skyler thinks something more sinister. The family moves into a hotel until the carpet and flooring can be replaced.\nWalt secretly meets with Saul and Patrick Kuby in the hotel's parking lot, asking for an update on Jesse's whereabouts. Saul hints at the possibility of killing Jesse, but Walt rejects the idea. Back in their hotel room, Skyler confronts Walt over his lies, having just seen him with Saul. Walt confesses that Jesse is upset and tried to burn down their house, but he is not concerned since Jesse decided against it. A shocked Skyler presses Walt to kill Jesse, who she views as a threat to their safety.\nA flashback reveals Hank Schrader trailed Jesse to Walt's residence after Jesse assaulted Saul, talking Jesse out of torching the house. Hank convinces Jesse to work together to bring Walt down, leaving moments before Walt arrived. Marie talks to her therapist about her issues with Walt but will not disclose the full extent of his criminality. Hank keeps Jesse at their house because he believes Jesse is more protected there; Marie agrees once Hank tells her that Jesse's involvement is bad for Walt. Hank and Steve Gomez tape Jesse as he recounts his history with Walt. Since there is no physical evidence, and Walt has left the meth business, Hank needs something incriminating enough to take to the authorities.\nWalt leaves a voicemail for Jesse, asking to meet in a plaza to reconcile over Brock Cantillo's poisoning. Hank coerces the reluctant Jesse to comply and retrieve appropriate evidence against Walt, despite Jesse's fear for his own safety. Hank reassures Jesse by recounting Walt's previous attempts to protect him at his own expense and states that since the meeting is in a public place, he will be safe. However, privately with Gomez, Hank is indifferent to Jesse risking his death; if Jesse is killed on camera, it can still be used as evidence.\nWired for sound, Jesse goes to meet with Walt but backs down after mistaking a nearby pedestrian for a hitman. Angered, Jesse goes to a pay phone to call Walt and threatens him, telling him that he will \"get him where he really lives.\" Hank berates Jesse for blowing the plan, but Jesse calmly informs him that he has a better strategy in mind. Meanwhile, Walt calls Todd, requesting another hit from his uncle, Jack.\n\nReception\nViewership\nThe episode was viewed by 4.41 million people on its original broadcast, which was a decrease from the 4.85 million of the previous episode.\n\nReviews\nIn 2019 The Ringer ranked \"Rabid Dog\" 38th out of the 62 total Breaking Bad episodes.\n\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\"Rabid Dog\" at the official Breaking Bad site\n\"Rabid Dog\" at IMDb",

It was released in March 1982 as the first single from their eighth and final studio album, Avalon (1982). \"More than This\" was the group's last top-10 UK hit, peaking at No. 6 on the UK Singles Chart, and also charted in the United States, reaching No. 58 on the Billboard Rock Top Tracks chart.\n\"More than This\" has become one of Roxy Music's most popular tracks. American alternative rock band 10,000 Maniacs released a cover version in 1997 that peaked at No. 25, and British singer Emmie released a cover that reached No. 5 in the UK in January 1999. The cover of the single's release is the painting Veronica Veronese, by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, which was completed in 1872 with Alexa Wilding as the model.\n\nIn Pop Culture\nThe Song was prominently used in 2003 romantic comedy Lost in Translation.\n\nComposition\nThe song was written by lead vocalist Bryan Ferry, who has stated in interviews that he began writing the songs for Avalon while on the western coast of Ireland, which he believes contributed to the dark melancholy of the album. \"More than This\" is somewhat unusual for a pop song in that Ferry's lead vocals end 1 minute and 45 seconds before the song does, leaving the remainder as a synthesizer-driven instrumental outro.\n\nPersonnel\nMusicians\n\nBryan Ferry – lead vocals, keyboards\nPhil Manzanera – lead guitar\nAndy Mackay – saxophone\nNeil Hubbard – guitar\nAlan Spenner – bass guitar\nJimmy Maelen – percussion\nFonzi Thornton – backing vocals\nAndy Newmark – drums\n\nCharts\nCertifications\nCover versions\nIn 1997, a cover performed by 10,000 Maniacs with Mary Ramsey on lead vocals was a single from their album Love Among the Ruins and became a US hit when it reached No. 25 on the Billboard Hot 100 on the week ending 29 August 1997. The version also debuted at its peak position, No. 87, on the UK Singles Chart on the week ending 28 September 1997. The video for the cover was filmed at House on the Rock. A live version was also included on their 2016 album Playing Favorites. \nEnglish singer-songwriter Emmie recorded a cover of the song and released it as a single on 11 January 1999. Produced by Mark Hadfield and Adam Carter-Ryan, her version of the song peaked at No. 5 on the UK Singles Chart, No. 25 on the Irish Singles Chart, and No. 39 in the Flanders region of Belgium. It ended 1999 at No. 153 on the UK year-end chart.\nBill Murray's character Bob Harris performs a karaoke version of \"More Than This\" in the 2003 Sofia Coppola film Lost in Translation.  This version is available as a hidden track at the end of the film's soundtrack album. Sofia Coppola and Bill Murray selected the song for inclusion during the filming of the movie. As Tom Nicholson wrote in Empire, \"It's absolutely perfect. [Murray] makes for a weary, fragile kind of Bryan Ferry, the lounge lizard who's lost the ability to really connect. He takes a shot before his first line then barely opens his mouth to sing, either too exhausted or too numb to really let go.\"\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\"More than This\" at Discogs (list of releases)",

In 1997, he was involved in a car accident on his way to soccer when the car he was travelling lost control on black ice and crashed into a pole. The driver of the car was killed. CareFlight responded to the accident and Sieders believes that they saved his life. He spent 88 days in intensive care, underwent 30 operations over 51 weeks in hospital.  He was initially told he would never walk again. A second car accident in December 2011 resulted in him being back in a wheelchair and limited walking through the use of crutches . He took up paracanoe after the accident to improve his fitness and reduce weight gain. He said \"It was developing into a serious problem so I looked around for something to do. It had to be a low-impact sport because of my injured hip.

    "text": "Wojciech Grzymała (23 April 1793 – 16 December 1871), also known as Albert Grzymala or Albert Grzymała, was a Polish soldier, politician, and banker who was a close associate in Paris of Polish composer Frédéric Chopin.\nGrzymała was born in Dunajowce (now Dunaivtsi, Ukraine). He began attending military school in 1807, and took part in the Battle of Borodino (1812), for which he received the medal Virtuti Militari. A freemason, and active in Polish politics during the 1820s, he was a principal orator at the funeral of Stanisław Staszic (1826). In 1828-1829, he was imprisoned in the Peter and Paul Fortress in St. Petersburg for his association with the Polish Patriotic Society. As a director of the Bank Polski, he negotiated in London and Paris for financial and other support for Poland after the 1830 November Uprising.\nGrzymała remained in Paris and became a society figure. He often acted as Chopin's adviser and \"gradually began to fill the role of elder brother in [his] life.\" He was a frequent correspondent of both Chopin and of George Sand; Sand, in a letter to Grzymała of June 1838, admitted her strong feelings for the composer and debated whether to abandon a current affair in order to begin a relationship with Chopin.\nGrzymała died, a bankrupt, in Nyon, Geneva, in 1871.\n\nReferences\nNotes\n\nSources\nChopin, Fryderyk (1962).

    "title": "Orlyonok",
    "text": "The Russian Children's Center \"Orlyonok\" (Russian: Орлёнок, lit. 'eaglet') is a federal state all-year camp for kids aged 11–16 (school grades 6 through 10). It is located in the Southern Federal District of Russia, on the eastern shore of the Black Sea, Krasnodar Krai, 45 kilometers north-west from Tuapse. Orlyonok is officially registered as the Federal State Education Organization.\nPrior to 1991, its full name was USSR Pioneer Camp \"Orlyonok\", and it was officially part of the Young Pioneer organization of the Soviet Union. Orlyonok received the Order of the Badge of Honour from the Komsomol (abbreviation of Communist Union of Youth) organization, a decoration awarded for outstanding social and civil accomplishments.\nOrlyonok welcomes children from all regions of Russia and other countries, regardless of their social strata or affiliation. During the combined summer/spring season it accepts up to 3,500 kids, in the fall/winter season – up to 1,200; the total number of children that it receives annually is about 20,000 children of both genders. Depending on the season, the duration of a stay varies between 21 and 30 days respectively.\n\nOrigins of the name\nIt is generally believed that the Orlyonok's name was taken from the title of a popular Young Pioneer song with the same name about a 16-year-old Red Army soldier about to be executed by enemies during the Russian Civil War.\nA statue named \"Orlyonok\" stands in the center of the camp, being part of the Memorial Plaza. It is similar to another statue with the same name in the city of Chelyabinsk.\n\nHistory\nThe Orlyonok Young Pioneer camp was established on July 12, 1960 by the decision of the Council of Ministers of the Russian SFSR (March 27, 1959). Similar to Artek, Orlyonok was intended for Russian children who were notable for excellent study, prize winners at various Student Olympiads, contests, or sports competitions, decorated or notable members of Komsomol or Young Pioneer organization activists.\nIn 1962 Orlyonok welcomed 50 representatives of the then-experimental Communard Movement, including kids from the famous Leningrad Frunze Community organization (now dismissed) led by Igor Ivanov. During this time, Orlyonok acquired some of its laws and traditions and adopted what has become known as the creative team effort methodology.\nAfter the successful experience of the previous year, in 1963 Orlyonok hosted the first all-USSR gathering of young communards.\nIn the beginning, the 1960 Orlyonok camp hosted 520 children, and by 1973 the annual attendance increased to nearly 17,000. By then Orlyonok had grown to an area of 3 square kilometers, with 60 buildings, including the dormitories, the \"Young Pioneer Palace\" (with a winter swimming pool filled with sea water, and a cinema), secondary school, medical building, Museum of Aircraft and Cosmonautics, astronomical observatory, sports stadium, playgrounds and a winter sports hall. There were more than 200 hobby groups of 50 different kinds, mostly in polytechnics, sports, and aesthetics. Orlyonok had its own passenger ship, 45 yachts, and many motor boats and rowboats.\nIn the early 1990s, when the Young Pioneer organization of the Soviet Union was dismantled, the camp attendance in Orlyonok was greatly decreased; however, attendance has increased since 2000, as the camp was nostalgically associated with the Young Pioneer camps of the past. It is believed that between the years 1960 and 2010 Orlyonok hosted over 800,000 children.\nOn July 12, 2010, Orlyonok celebrated their 50th anniversary. It welcomed guests from all over Russia and abroad, all ages and walks of life, whose life was connected with Orlyonok. The celebration culminated with a special concert and fireworks at the central stadium.\nIn 2011 Orlyonok hosted a delegation from UNESCO reviewing Orlyonok admission to the UNESCO Associated Schools Project Network. In 2012 Orlyonok was admitted to the UNESCO ASPNet.\nOn February 5, 2014, Orlyonok hosted the final part of the 2014 Winter Olympics torch relay. A relay torch was lit with the Olympic flame next to the Memorial Stone, from where it was carried throughout Orlyonok by 15 torchbearers covering a distance of approximately 3 kilometers.\nIn April 2025, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) warned that Russia, then undertaking an invasion of Ukraine, planned to intensify during the summer of that year the deportation of Ukrainian children to its occupied and own territory, including to Orlyonok and also Artek. Children from Transnistria, a Russian-occupied territory of Moldova, had also been sent previously to Orlyonok, and also to Artek. According to the Moldovan NGO Promo-LEX, the participation of children from Transnistria in both camps is one of Russia's tools for the ideological transformation and militarization of these children, ensuring their loyalty to Russia.\n\nNotable visitors\nYuri Alekseyevich Gagarin (1964) – Soviet cosmonaut, first human in space.\nAlexey Arkhipovich Leonov (1964, 1969, 1978) – Soviet cosmonaut, first human who conducted space walk.\nVladimir Mikhaylovich Komarov (1964) – Soviet cosmonaut.\nKonstantin Petrovich Feoktistov (1964) – Soviet cosmonaut and space engineer.\nAleksandra Nikolayevna Pakhmutova (1964, 1967, 1970, 1983) – Soviet and Russian composer.\nNikolai Nikolaevich Dobronravov (1964, 1970, 1983) – Soviet and Russian poet.\nDmitri Borisovich Kabalevski (1967) – Soviet music composer.\nBoris Vladimirovich Zakhoder (1968) – Soviet poet and children's writer.\nYuri Vladimirovich Nikulin (1968, 1971) – Soviet and Russian actor and clown.\nAndrei Alexandrovich Mironov (1968) – Soviet theater and film actor.\nSergey Vladimirovich Mikhalkov (1974) – Soviet and Russian children's writer, also the composer of the Russian anthem lyrics.\nRobert Ivanovich Rozhdestvensky (1974) – Soviet poet.\nVasily Pavlovich Solovyov-Sedoi (1976) – Soviet classical composer\nGianni Rodari (1979) – Italian writer and journalist.\nVladimir Yakovlevich Shainsky (1982, 1983, 1985, 2005) – Soviet and Russian composer.\nVladislav Aleksandrovich Tretiak (1982) – Soviet hockey goaltender.\n\nCamp description\nOrlyonok is really seven independent camps, Solnechnyi, Zvyozdnyi, Stremitel'nyi, Komsomolskiy, Shtormovoy, Dozornyi, Olimpiyskiy, located on the combined territory of more than 244 hectares. Four of the camps, Solnechnyi, Shtormovoy, Zvyozdnyi, Stremitel'nyi, are all-year while the rest close for winter. Every camp has extended facilities in addition to the sleeping accommodations.\nThe original names of the camps reflect their history and overall themes:\n\nSolnechnyi (Russian: Солнечный, English: \"Solar\") – main theme is \"Adventure\" and every child attending the camp works on a project that has to be completed during the stay. It is not just about the project itself, it is also about making and keeping friends and helping each other achieve success. As part of the program, kids go hiking and learn basics of working together as a team.\nZvyozdnyi (Russian: Звёздный, English: \"Celestial\") – themed after cosmos exploration popular in the 1970s, it is faithful to the theme of stars – space and astronomy; twice a year special programs are conducted under the auspice of the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center. The main theme of the camp is leadership, both in space exploration and on earth. It is believed that the name was suggested by the first person in space, Yuri Gagarin, when he visited Zvyozdnyi in November 1964.\nStremitel'nyi (Russian: Стремительный, English: \"Aspiring\") – main theme of this camp is \"I am a citizen of Russia\" and during the camp kids can \"create\" their own \"Aspiring country\" complete with cities (eaglet circles), specializing in various activities. Just like a real country, \"Aspiring country\" holds presidential elections, implements programs and establishes a country capital. Every summer Aspiring is hosting the Festival of Visual Arts, accepting creative kids from Russia, and being true to the spirit of creativity.\nKomsomolskiy (Russian: Комсомольский, approximate English: \"belonging to Komsomol\") – from the very beginning was to be the school for future leaders. While staying at the camp kids can choose from the multitude of programs offered, \"The Image of the Leader\", \"How to work in a team,\" \"How to organize work,\" \"How to work with information,\" \"Community Corner\", etc.\nShtormovoy (Russian: Штормовой, English: \"Stormy\") – entire camp not only the closest to the Black Sea, it resembles a ship, both architecturally and structurally. The building itself has a deck, a superstructure facing the sea, a stern, and its port side faces the center of Orlyonok. Maritime themes are throughout, even in the names: the crews, the cabins, galley, mess hall, etc. Life on board is organized in accordance with naval traditions.\nDozornyi (Russian: Дозорный, approximate English: \"Patrolling\") – themed after the Border Guard Service of Russia troops, it was designed and built to resemble one of the border posts while being a summer camp at the same time. Children who attend the Border Guard Academy learn basics of guarding country borders, terrain navigation, outdoor camping and survival, etc. The camp is modeled to be its own border post with a strict schedule, discipline, daily duties.\nOlimpiyskiy (Russian: Олимпийский, English: \"Olympic\") – the youngest of the camps, its themes are sport, promoting healthy lifestyle and cultural heritage of the Olympics. Approaching XXII Olympic Winter Games in nearby Sochi also inspired all the programs that this camp offers. Arriving kids enter \"Olympic House\" where they learn about the history of the Olympic Games and Olympic Movement in Russia and abroad, legendary sportsmen and sportswomen, precepts of the sportsmanship, etc.\nIn addition to the seven camps, Orlyonok has its own hospital, auto park, hotel, radio and TV center, various administrative buildings, museum of aviation and cosmonautics, observatory. The seaside boardwalk that runs from the Stormovoy camp to the Solnechnyi camp is part of what is considered the central part of Orlyonok that includes Memorial Plaza with the statue of Orlyonok, \"Palace of Culture and Sport\" (Russian: ДКС, Дом Культуры и Спорта) that is connected to the library called \"Pharmacy for the Soul\" and is adjacent to the stadium \"Youth\".\nA Memorial Stone commemorating the founding of the camp on July 12, 1960 stands close to the Solnechnyi camp. On it there is a carved five-line stanza that reads (approximate translation):\n\n12.VII.1960\nThis date is carved on stone\nRemember friend, Here are the Eaglets\nStood in formation\nThe flags were flown\nFrom hence began the Camp\nThere is no single official Orlyonok uniform, instead, there are uniforms for different camps. Also, while not strictly enforced, eaglets, while at the camp, wear colored neckerchiefs, which have different color combinations for different camps.\n\nOrlyonok culture\nOrlyonok has its own history and traditions, one of the most important among them – respect for people, their work, their personality, and experience ... This requires future \"Eaglets\" to have a certain culture of communication and interaction with peers and adults. Furthermore, almost everything is planned and done by the kids themselves, as part of joint activities performed together with teachers and peers. For example, self-help is the rule of the day: from simple things like making one's bed in the morning and self-care, to collectively serving a rotating duty around the camp and in the dining rooms.\nThough having a lot in common with the world-wide Scouts youth, the Eaglets' culture has a few notable points distinguishing them, one of them – not being separated into groups based on gender. Eaglets, too, enjoy camping and hiking, they place great emphasis on being self-reliant, responsible and trustworthy when asked for help. It is also stressed that merely accumulating a history of achievements is secondary to the goal of self-development and growth, with everyone's input helping to grow all together as a team.\nEaglet Circle\nThe Eaglet Circle is the smallest stable self-governing, self-regulating unit, usually under 35 kids, unlike Boy Scouts, of both genders, directed by two or more Eaglet Circle Leaders. Initially members of the Eaglet Circle are called \"Eaglet Candidates\", and the actual \"Eaglet\" title has to be earned by successfully completing tasks assigned, while displaying a positive attitude. The processes of officially establishing the Eaglet Circle and assigning individual Eaglet titles happens during the second and third weeks of camp.\nThe Eaglet Circle, while supervised and directed by one or more Eaglet Circle Leaders, is also governed by the Eaglet Circle Captain (elected permanently for the duration of the camp) and the Eaglet Circle Captain of the Day (elected daily during the evening meeting). There are sometimes more than one Captain that addresses different aspects of the Eaglet Circle (for example, for the duration of a trip there could be the Trip Captain in addition to the main one), but they all work together with the Eaglet Circle, with the Eaglet Circle meeting having the final say on things that affect everybody.\nThroughout the day, there could be multiple smaller units formed, Task Committees. The smallest Task Committee may be 3–4 kids that will work on assignments. For example, an entire Eaglet Circle may have to come up with a stage performance, and to make the task easier, will break into smaller Task Committees addressing various parts: stage setup, choreography, music, script, troop, etc. etc. Once work commences, results are reported at the Eaglet Circle meeting.\nEaglet Circles obey five Eaglet Circle laws and follow about a dozen traditions. Each Eaglet Circle is also supposed to have some kind of signature, distinguishing it from other circles, and this is where creativity and improvisation plays an important part; simply copying what others have done before is viewed as below the Eaglet Circle's self-respect. The Eaglet Circle's signature could be a song, a T-shirt, a name, a talisman or a mascot, or the combination of all of these, but altogether it should have some form of meaning for the particular Eaglet Circle that it represents.\nThe original laws and traditions brought by Communards in 1962 and 1963 now became these:\nEaglet Circle Laws\n\nThe Zero-Zero Law – Be on time with attendance and tasks; respect others' time. This law also calls to be brief and eloquent when talking to others, picking up the correct words to avoiding bombarding listeners with meaningless words or phrases.\nThe Territory Law – Stay within the camp grounds unless you are part of a Task Committee or an Eaglet Circle working on a task; also, obtain permission to do so when working on an individual task. Try not to trespass other Eaglet Circle's territory when they are busy with something, unless you can offer help. This law also marks the limits of acceptable behavior (positive territory); bad habits and destructive/offensive deeds (negative territory), are to be left outside.\nThe Green Law – Respect our environment, local and global, don't litter, and pick up trash even if it is not yours. Do something good all the time, plant trees or flowers, clean up what you can and help others, even when not asked to. There is no Earth B if we trash this Earth A.\nThe Sea Law – Respect the Black Sea and know that it does not like recklessness. While it is beautiful and playful at one hour, it can unexpectedly turn cruel and deadly at another. This law extends to any entity that is dangerous and unpredictable: don't overestimate your strengths and know your limitations.\nThe Raised Hand Law – When one raises a hand, one speaks, everyone listens without interrupting. It is also understood that he or she is brief in what has to be said and will not be wasting others' time. This also means – before raising your hand, think through what you have to say. If it is a question, than maybe it has been answered already. If it is a statement, what value will it add?\nEaglet Circle traditions\n\nTradition of Kindness – Every morning starts with a \"Good Morning!\" no matter how bad the weather may be, wishing all to have a good day. Every evening ends with the Eaglet Circle meeting closing on a positive note and wishing for all to have a good night. Unexpected and nice surprises are the norm of almost every day, i.e., maybe a post card congratulating the passing of dark clouds in the sky, or a photo/painting of a flower, or anything small but nice, passed between Eaglets and Eaglet Circles as tokens of comradeship.\nEverybody is equal in the Eaglet Circle, everybody has the same rights and responsibilities; one can be either within the Circle or outside, and nobody is above or below the Circle and the laws that govern it. All discussions held give opportunity for everyone's opinion to be said (see The Raised Hand Law).\nNobody steps in the interior of the Eaglet Circle during the meeting or a song, because it is similar to stepping on the invisible \"Circle's Heart\" (the only exception – during the goodbyes when the Camp is over, Eaglets put their bags in the center of the circle).\nIf it is not you, then who – when something has to be done, pick it up and get it done (if needed permissions and approvals, do that, too); there are no passive people, there are people who simply have not found something positive or useful to do that would appeal to them.\nIf it is not creative, then why bother at all – all tasks are done not just by following step after step, but also with a creative flair, like a kind of \"signature\" that makes it different from similar tasks done by others before. A task done creatively is worth three done out of necessity.\nWhen criticizing, be prepared to offer something better, otherwise be quiet and at least don't interfere with others working out a solution. Blanket negative statements are also off limits.\nWrite down what has been said – a thought not written down is lost forever. Eaglets are encouraged to keep brief daily diaries where they would match achievements with goals set and note everything else that goes with that.\nSelf-governing, self-regulation, self-improvement – starting from the first day, \"Let's think how to make things better and more interesting to all\" and never stop adding new, fixing/improving existing things that maybe need to be fixed or improved; non-stop seeking of ideas and ways of doing it all better, maybe even the way nobody ever has done it before.\nTradition of volunteering – Volunteering does not have to be top-down planned; some tasks, like cleaning up a nearby creek or planting trees destroyed during a recent winter storm, only needs some collective thinking and active participation.\nThere are no negative people, there are negative deeds – nobody is born into being bad, people do make mistakes and sometimes do something bad; those bad deeds are what gets discussed, not personalities or characters. It also means that quite a great deal of credit is given to be trusted, but it, too, may run out when abused regularly.\nTradition of songs – Singing a song together in an Eaglet Circle is a sacred moment, and it cannot be just any song. Songs are picked to be bonding and positive; not like a choir, but like a circle of friends and comrades, with everyone's voice heard. An Eaglet song can be started by anyone, but once it is started it has to be sung by everybody from the beginning to the end. This tradition also extends to any tasks done; similarly to singing, tasks have to be done from the beginning to the end. (Exception to this tradition is when someone is sad and does not feel like joining in – he or she can be present, but quiet, and it is understood to be a sign of sorrow). Most Eaglet Circle meetings end with a song sang standing in a circle with everyone's hands on the shoulders of the Eaglets to the left and to the right.\nTradition of Eaglet Circle evening meetings – every evening before retiring for the night is a meeting that has three questions, \"What went well throughout the day and how can it be continued? What went wrong throughout the day and what to do about it? What's next?\". Good deeds and successful completion of tasks are noted, awards and tokens of appreciation are given to those deserving of them. Mistakes and errors are discussed and ways to avoid these in the future are suggested. The next day's plan is worked out and elections take place (for example, a new Captain of the Day is elected).\nTradition of Eaglets' Code of Honor – the \"Eaglet\" title can be lost by doing negative deeds (it is called \"neglecting The Eaglets' Code of Honor\") or by being passive and/or destructive toward what others are trying to do. The title will have to be regained again, if one wants his voice to be heard during the Eaglet Circle meetings.\n\nCommemorations\nA minor planet, 2188 Orlenok, was discovered in 1976 by Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Zhuravlyova and is named in honor of the camp.\nThe book Lost in Moscow (sometimes called Lost in Moscow: A brat in the USSR; published by Turnstone Press in 2005) by Kirsten Koza, chronicles the true-life experience of an eleven-year-old Canadian girl's summer at Orlyonok during 1977.\nSeptember 1–12, 2000 – a group of Orlyonok employees climbed the west summit of the mountain Elbrus, dedicating this to the Orlyonok's 40th anniversary.\n\nSee also\nIgor Ivanov\nArtek\n\nFootnotes\nExternal links\nRussian Children Center \"Orlyonok\", official homepage (English)\nRussian Children Center \"Orlyonok\", official homepage (Russian)\nEaglet Circle, article on SummerCamp.ru (Russian)\nThe website \"Kommunarstvo\" – (in Russian)",

    "title": "Offside (association football)",
    "text": "Offside  is one of the laws in association football, codified in Law 11 of the Laws of the Game. The law states that a player is in an offside position if any of their body parts, except the hands and arms, are in the opponents' half of the pitch and closer to the opponents' goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent (the last opponent is usually, but not necessarily, the goalkeeper).\nBeing in an offside position is not an offence in itself, but a player so positioned when the ball is played by a teammate can be judged guilty of an offside offence if they receive the ball or will otherwise become \"involved in active play\", will \"interfere with an opponent\", or will \"gain an advantage\" by being in that position. Offside is often considered one of the most difficult-to-understand aspects of the sport.\n\nSignificance\nOffside is judged at the moment the ball is last touched by the most recent teammate to touch the ball. Being in an offside position is not an offence in itself. A player who was in an offside position at the moment the ball was last touched or played by a teammate must then become involved in active play, in the opinion of the referee, in order for an offence to occur. When the offside offence occurs, the referee stops play, and awards an indirect free kick to the defending team from the place where the offending player became involved in active play.\nThe offside offence is neither a foul nor misconduct as it does not belong to Law 12. Like fouls, however, any play (such as the scoring of a goal) that occurs after an offence has taken place, but before the referee is able to stop the play, is nullified. The only time an offence related to offside is cautionable is if a defender deliberately leaves the field in order to deceive their opponents regarding a player's offside position, or if a forward, having left the field, returns and gains an advantage. In neither of these cases is the player penalised for being offside; instead they are cautioned for acts of unsporting behaviour.\nAn attacker who is able to receive the ball behind the opposition defenders is often in a good position to score. The offside rule limits attackers' ability to do this, requiring that they be onside when the ball is played forward. Though restricted, well-timed passes and fast running allow an attacker to move into such a situation after the ball is kicked forward without committing the offence. Officiating decisions regarding offside, which can often be a matter of only centimetres or inches, can be critical in games, as they may determine whether a promising attack can continue, or even if a goal is allowed to stand.\nOne of the main duties of the assistant referees is to assist the referee in adjudicating offside—their position on the sidelines giving a more useful view sideways across the pitch.  Assistant referees communicate that an offside offence has occurred by raising a signal flag. However, as with all officiating decisions in the game, adjudicating offside is ultimately up to the referee, who can overrule the advice of their assistants if they see fit.\n\nApplication\nThe application of the offside rule may be considered in three steps: offside position, offside offence, and offside sanction.\n\nOffside position\nA player is in an \"offside position\" if they are in the opposing team's half of the field and also \"nearer to the opponents' goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent.\" The 2005 edition of the Laws of the Game included a new IFAB decision that stated, \"In the definition of offside position, 'nearer to his opponents' goal line' means that any part of their head, body or feet is nearer to their opponents' goal line than both the ball and the second last opponent. The arms are not included in this definition\". By 2017, the wording had changed to say that, in judging offside position, \"The hands and arms of all players, including the goalkeepers, are not considered.\" In other words, a player is in an offside position if two conditions are met:\n\nAny part of the player's head, body or feet is in the opponents' half of the field (excluding the half-way line).\nAny part of the player's head, body or feet is closer to the opponents' goal line than  both the ball and the second-last opponent.\nThe goalkeeper counts as an opponent in the second condition, but it is not necessary that the last opponent be the goalkeeper.\n\nOffside offence\nA player in an offside position at the moment the ball is touched or played by a teammate is only penalised for committing an offside offence if, in the opinion of the referee, they become involved in active play by:\n\nInterfering with play\n\"playing or touching the ball passed or touched by a team-mate\"\nInterfering with an opponent\n\"preventing an opponent from playing or being able to play the ball by clearly obstructing the opponent's line of vision or\nchallenging an opponent for the ball or\nclearly attempting to play a ball which is close to them when this action impacts on an opponent or\nmaking an obvious action which clearly impacts on the ability of an opponent to play the ball\"\nGaining an advantage by playing the ball or interfering with an opponent when it has\n\"- rebounded or been deflected off the goalpost, crossbar, match official or an opponent\n– been deliberately saved by any opponent\"\nIn addition to the above criteria, in the 2017–18 edition of the Laws of the Game, the IFAB made a further clarification that, \"In situations where a player moving from, or standing in, an offside position is in the way of an opponent and interferes with the movement of the opponent towards the ball this is an offside offence if it impacts on the ability of the opponent to play or challenge for the ball.\"\nThere is no offside offence if a player receives the ball directly from a goal kick, a corner kick, or a throw-in. It is also not an offence if the ball was last deliberately played by an opponent (except for a deliberate save). In this context, according to the IFAB, \"A 'save' is when a player stops, or attempts to stop, a ball which is going into or very close to the goal with any part of the body except the hands/arms (unless the goalkeeper within the penalty area).\"\nAn offside offence may occur if a player receives the ball directly from either a direct free kick, indirect free kick or dropped-ball.\nSince offside is judged at the time the ball is touched or played by a teammate, not when the player receives the ball, it is possible for a player to receive the ball significantly past the second-to-last opponent, or even the last opponent, without committing an offence, since an onside player is free to run to any position after the ball is played.\nA player who was offside when their teammate played the ball (and therefore liable for an offside offence should they interfere with play) but becomes onside when the ball is played by another player then ceases to be liable for an offside offence. That is, the determination of offside is reset each time the ball is played by a different onside player. \nDetermining whether a player is \"involved in active play\" can be complex. The quote, \"If he's not interfering with play, what's he doing on the pitch?\" has been attributed to Bill Nicholson and Danny Blanchflower.  In an effort to avoid such criticisms, which were based on the fact that phrases such as \"interfering with play\", \"interfering with an opponent\", and \"gaining an advantage\" were not clearly defined, FIFA issued new guidelines for interpreting the offside law in 2003; and these were incorporated into Law 11 in July 2005. The new wording sought to define the three cases more precisely, but a number of football associations and confederations continued to request more information about what movements a player in an offside position could make without interfering with an opponent. In response to these requests, IFAB circular 3 was issued in 2015 to provide additional guidance on the criteria for interfering with an opponent. This additional guidance is now included in the main body of the law, and forms the last three conditions under the heading \"Interfering with an opponent\" as shown above. The circular also contained additional guidance on the meaning of a save, in the context of a ball that has \"been deliberately saved by any opponent.\"\n\nOffside sanction\nThe sanction for an offside offence is an indirect free kick for the opponent at the place where the offence occurred, even if it is in the player's own half of the field of play.\n\nOfficiating\nIn enforcing this rule, the referee depends greatly on an assistant referee, who generally keeps in line with the second-to-last opponent, the ball, or the halfway line, whichever is closer to the goal line of their relevant end. An assistant referee signals for an offside offence by first raising their flag to a vertical position and then, if the referee stops play, by partly lowering their flag to an angle that signifies the location of the offence:\n\nFlag pointed at a 45-degree angle downwards: offence has occurred in the third of the pitch nearest to the assistant referee;\nFlag parallel to the ground: offence has occurred in the middle third of the pitch;\nFlag pointed at a 45-degree angle upwards: offence has occurred in the third of the pitch furthest from the assistant referee.\nThe assistant referees' task with regard to offside can be difficult, as they need to keep up with attacks and counter-attacks, consider which players are in an offside position when the ball is played, and then determine whether and when the offside-positioned players become involved in active play. The risk of false judgement is further increased by the foreshortening effect, which occurs when the distance between the attacking player and the assistant referee is significantly different from the distance to the defending player, and the assistant referee is not directly in line with the defender. The difficulty of offside officiating is often underestimated by spectators. Trying to judge if a player is level with an opponent at the moment the ball is kicked is not easy: if an attacker and a defender are running in opposite directions, they can be two metres (6') apart in less than a second.\nSome researchers believe that offside officiating errors are \"optically inevitable\". It has been argued that human beings and technological media are incapable of accurately detecting an offside position quickly enough to make a timely decision. Sometimes it simply is not possible to keep all the relevant players in the visual field at once. There have been some proposals for automated enforcement of the offside rule.\n\nVAR and semi-automation\nIn matches using Video Assistant Referees (VAR) assistant referees who decide on offsides are required to avoid raising the flag for an offside decision until the play proceeds to a natural conclusion, unless the offside is obvious. This allows a team who might have been called for an offside offence to instead continue and any subsequent goal to be checked by VAR.\nBeginning in the mid-2020s, Semi-Automated Offside Technology (SAOT) began to be used at high-level games. SAOT systems use multiple high-speed cameras to determine the positions of players at the moment the ball is kicked, assisting the VAR in making speedy offside decisions. SAOT produces 3D virtual replays of the situation which are displayed on stadium screens and broadcasts.\n\nMotivation\nThe motivations for offside rules varied at different times, and were not always clearly stated when the rules were changed. \nAccording to the anonymous author of a November 1863 newspaper article in the Sporting Gazette, \"For a player to place himself nearer his opponent's goal than the ball, and to wait for it to be kicked to him, is not anywhere recognised but as being decidedly unfair\".  Curry and Dunning suggest that offside play was considered \"highly ungentlemanly\" at some schools; this attitude may have been reflected in the use of terminology such as \"sneaking\" at Eton and \"loiter[ing]\" at Cambridge.\nIn general, offside rules intend to prevent players from \"goal-hanging\"–staying near the opponent's goal and waiting for the ball to be passed to them directly. This was considered to be unsportsmanlike and made the game boring.\nIn contrast, the offside rules force players not to get ahead of the ball, and thus favour dribbling the ball and short passes over few long passes.\n\nHistory\nBefore 1863\nTraditional games\nA law similar to offside was used in the game of hurling to goals played in Cornwall in the early 17th century:[H]ee who hath the ball [...] must deale no Fore-ball, viz. he may not throw it to any of his mates, standing neerer the goale, then himselfe.\n\nSchool and university football\nOffside laws are found in the largely uncodified and informal football games played at English public schools in the early 19th century.  An 1832 article discussing the Eton wall game complained of \"[t]he interminable multiplicity of rules about sneaking, picking up, throwing, rolling, in straight, with a vast number more\", using the term \"sneaking\" to refer to Eton's offside law.  The novel Tom Brown's School Days, published in 1857 but based on the author's experiences at Rugby School from 1834 to 1842, discussed that school's offside law: My sons! [...] you have gone past the ball, and must struggle now right through the scrummage, and get round and back again to your own side, before you can be of any further use \nThe first published set of laws of any code of football (Rugby School, 1845), stated that \"[a] player is off his side if the ball has touched one of his own side behind him, until the other side touch it.\"  Such a player was prevented from kicking the ball, touching the ball down, or interfering with an opponent.\nMany other school and university laws from this period were similar to Rugby School's in that they were \"strict\"—i.e. any player ahead of the ball was in an off-side position.  (This is similar to the current offside law in rugby, under which any player between the ball and the opponent's goal who takes part in play, is liable to be penalised.) Such laws included Shrewsbury School (1855), Uppingham School (1857), Trinity College, Hartford (1858), Winchester College (1863), and the Cambridge Rules of 1863.\nSome school and university rules provided an exception to this general pattern.  In the 1847 laws of the Eton Field Game, a player could not be considered \"sneaking\" if there were four or more opponents between him and the opponents' goal line. A similar \"rule of four\" was found in the 1856 Cambridge Rules and the rules of Charterhouse School (1863).\n\nClub football\nMost surviving rules of independent football clubs from before 1860 lack any offside law.  This is true of the brief handwritten set of laws for the Foot-Ball Club of Edinburgh (1833), the published laws of Surrey Football Club (1849), the first set of laws of Sheffield Football Club (1858) and those of Melbourne Football Club (1859). In the Sheffield game, players known as \"kick-throughs\" were positioned permanently near the opponents' goal.\nIn the early 1860s, this began to change.  In 1861, Forest FC adopted a set of laws based on the 1856 Cambridge Rules, with its \"rule of four\".  The 1862 laws of Barnes FC featured a strict offside law.  Sheffield FC adopted a weak offside law at the beginning of the 1863–64 season.\n\nJ. C. Thring\nJ. C. Thring was an advocate for the strictest possible offside law.  A resident master at Uppingham School from 1859 to 1864, Thring  criticised most existing offside laws for being too lax. The Rugby laws, for example, were at fault because they permitted an offside player to rejoin play immediately after an opponent touched the ball, while Eton's rule of four allowed \"an immense amount of sneaking\" when the number of players was unlimited.\nThring expressed his views through correspondence in the sporting newspapers such as The Field, and through the publication in 1862 of The Simplest Game, a proposed set of laws of football.  In The Simplest Game, Thring included a strict offside law which required a player in an offside position (\"out of play\", in Thring's terminology) to \"return behind the ball as soon as possible\". \nThe influence of Thring's views is evidenced by the adoption of his proposed offside law from The Simplest Game in the first draft of the FA laws (see below).\n\nThe F. A. laws of 1863\nOn 17 November 1863, the newly formed Football Association adopted a resolution mirroring Thring's law from the Simplest Game:\n\nA player is \"out of play\" immediately he is in front of the ball and must return behind the ball as soon as possible. If the ball is kicked by his own side past a player he may not touch or kick it, or advance until one of the other side has first kicked it or one of his own side on a level with or in front of him has been able to kick it.\nThis text was reflected in the first draft of laws drawn up by FA secretary Ebenezer Morley.\nOn 24 November, Morley presented his draft laws to the  FA for final approval.  That meeting was, however, disrupted by a dispute over the subject of \"hacking\" (allowing players to carry the ball, provided they could be kicked in the shins by opponents when doing so, in the manner of Rugby School).  The opponents of hacking brought the delegates' attention to the Cambridge Rules of 1863 (which banned carrying and hacking):  Discussion of the Cambridge rules, and suggestions for possible communication with Cambridge on the subject, served to delay the final \"settlement\" of the laws to a further meeting, on 1 December.  A number of representatives who supported rugby-style football did not attend this additional meeting, resulting in hacking and carrying being banned.\n\nAlthough the offside law was not itself a significant issue in the dispute between the pro- and anti-hacking clubs, it was completely rewritten. The original law, taken from Thring's Simplest Game, was replaced by a modified version of the equivalent law from the Cambridge Rules:When a player has kicked the ball any one of the same side who is nearer to the opponent's goal line is out of play and may not touch the ball himself nor in any way whatever prevent any other player from doing so until the ball has been played; but no player is out of play when the ball is kicked from behind the goal line.\nThe law adopted by the FA was \"strict\"—i.e., it penalised any player in front of the ball.  There was one exception for the \"kick from behind the goal line\" (the 1863 laws' equivalent of a goal kick).  This exception was necessary because every player on the attacking side would have otherwise been \"out of play\" from such a kick.\n\nSubsequent developments: offside position\nThree-player rule (1866)\nAt the first revision of the FA laws, in February 1866, an important qualifier was added to soften the \"strict\" offside law: When a player has kicked the ball, any one of the same side who is nearer to the opponents' goal line is out of play, and may not touch the ball himself, nor in any way whatever prevent any other player from doing so, until the ball has been played, unless there are at least three of his opponents between him and their own goal; but no player is out of play when the ball is kicked from behind the goal line.\nAt the FA's meeting, the alteration \"gave rise to a lengthy discussion, many thinking with Mr Morley that it would be better to do away with the off side [law] altogether, especially as the Sheffield clubs had none. It being found, however, that the rule could not be expunged without notice, the alteration was passed.\"\nContemporaneous reports do not indicate the reason for the change.  Charles Alcock, writing in 1890, suggested that it was made in order to induce two public schools, Westminster and Charterhouse, to join the association.  Those two schools did indeed become members of the FA after the next annual FA meeting (February 1867), in response to a letter-writing campaign by newly installed FA secretary Robert Graham.\n\nEarly proposals for change (1867–1874)\nOver the next seven years, there were several attempts to change the three-player rule, but none was successful:\n\nIn 1867, Barnes FC proposed that the offside rule should be removed altogether, arguing that \"a player did not stop to count whether there were three of his opponents between him and their own goal\".\nIt was also proposed that the FA should revert to its original \"strict\" offside rule.  This change was introduced in 1868 (Branham College), 1871 (\"The Oxford Association\") and 1872 (Notts County).\nThere were attempts to introduce the one-player rule of the Sheffield Football Association in 1867 (Sheffield FC), 1872 (Sheffield Football Association), 1873 (Nottingham Forest), and 1874 (Sheffield Association).\nOffside was the subject of the biggest dispute between the Sheffield Football Association (which produced its own \"Sheffield Rules\") and the Football Association.  However, the two codes were eventually unified without any change in this area; the Sheffield Clubs accepted the FA's three-player offside rule in 1877, after the FA compromised by allowing the throw-in to be taken in any direction.\n\nOffside in own half (1907)\nThe original laws allowed players to be in an offside position even when in their own half.  This happened rarely, but was possible when one team pressed high up the field, for example in a Sunderland v Wolverhampton Wanderers match in December 1901.  When an attacking team adopted the so-called \"one back\" game, in which only the goalkeeper and one outfield player remained in defensive positions, it was even possible for players to be caught offside in their own penalty area.\nIn May 1905, Clyde FC suggested that players should not be offside in their own half, but this suggestion was rejected by the Scottish Football Association.  It was objected that the change would lead to \"forwards hanging about close to the half-way line, as opportunists\".  After the Scotland v England international of April 1906 ended with the Scottish wingers being repeatedly caught offside by England's use of a \"one back\" game, Clyde again proposed the same rule-change to the Scottish FA meeting: this time it was accepted.\nThe Scottish proposal gained support in England. At the 1906 meeting of the International Football Association Board, the Scottish FA announced that it would introduce the proposed change at the next annual meeting, in 1907.  In March 1907, the council of the [English] Football Association approved this change,  and it was passed by IFAB in June 1907.\n\nTwo-player rule (1925)\nThe Scottish FA urged the change from a three-player to a two-player offside rule as early as 1893. Such a change was first proposed at a meeting of IFAB in 1894, where it was rejected.  It was proposed again by the SFA in 1902, upon the urging of Celtic FC, and again rejected.  A further proposal from the SFA also failed in 1913, after the Football Association objected.  The SFA advanced the same proposal in 1914, when it was again rejected after opposition from both the Football Association and the Football Association of Wales.\nMeetings of the International Board were suspended after 1914 because of the First World War. After they resumed in 1920, the SFA once again proposed the two-player rule in 1922, 1923, and 1924.  In 1922 and 1923, the Scottish Association withdrew its proposal after English FA opposed it.  In 1924, the Scottish proposal was once again opposed by the English FA, and defeated; it was, however, indicated that a version of the proposal would be adopted the next year.\nOn 30 March 1925, the FA arranged a trial match at Highbury where two proposed changes to the offside rules were tested.  During the first half, a player could not be offside unless within forty yards of the opponents' goal-line.  In the second half, the two-player rule was used.\nThe two-player proposal was considered by the FA at its annual meeting on 8 June. Proponents cited the new rule's potential to reduce stoppages, avoid refereeing errors, and improve the spectacle, while opponents complained that it would give \"undue advantage to attackers\"; referees were overwhelmingly opposed to the change. The two-player rule was nevertheless approved by the FA by a large majority.   At IFAB's meeting later that month, the two-player rule finally became part of the Laws of the Game.\nThe two-player rule was one of the more significant rule changes in the history of the game during the 20th century.  It led to an immediate change in the style of play, with the game becoming more stretched, \"short passing giv[ing] way to longer balls\", and the development of the W-M formation. It also led to an increase in goalscoring:  4,700 goals were scored in 1,848 Football League games in 1924–25. This number rose to 6,373 goals (from the same number of games) in 1925–26.\n\nAttacker level with second-last defender (1990)\nIn 1990, IFAB declared that an attacker level with the second-last defender is onside, whereas previously such a player had been considered offside.  This change, proposed by the Scottish FA, was made in order to \"encourage the attacking team\" by \"giving the attacking player an advantage over the defender\".\n\nParts of body (2005)\nIn 2005, IFAB clarified that, when evaluating an attacking player's position for the purposes of the offside law, the part of the player's head, body or feet closest to the defending team's goal-line should be considered, with the hands and arms being excluded because \"there is no advantage to be gained if only the arms are in advance of the opponent\".  In 2016, it was further clarified that this principle should apply to all players, both attackers and defenders, including the goalkeeper.\n\nDefender outside the field of play (2009)\nIn 2009, it was stated that a defender who leaves the field of play without the referee's permission must be considered to be on the nearest boundary line for the purposes of deciding whether an attacker is in an offside position.\n\nHalfway line (2016)\nIn 2016, it was clarified that a player on the halfway line itself cannot be in an offside position: part of the player's head, body or feet must be within the opponent's half of the field of play in order to be considered offside.\n\nUnadopted experiments\nDuring the 1973–74 and 1974–75 seasons, an experimental version of the offside rule was operated in the Scottish League Cup and Drybrough Cup competitions. The concept was that offside should only apply in the last 18 yards (16 m) of play (inside or beside the penalty area). To signify this, the horizontal line of the penalty area was extended to the touchlines. FIFA President Sir Stanley Rous attended the 1973 Scottish League Cup Final, which was played using these rules. The manager of one of the teams involved, Celtic manager Jock Stein, complained that it was unfair to expect teams to play under one set of rules in one game and then a different set a few days before or later. The experiment was quietly dropped after the 1974–75 season, as no proposal for a\nfurther experiment or rule change was submitted for the Scottish Football Association board to consider. It was briefly experimented again in the 1991 FIFA U-17 World Championship, in Italy.\nIn 1972, the North American Soccer League adopted a variation of the offside rule in which it added a line on the field 35 yards from each goal line; a player could only be offside within that area of the opponent's half. The rule was dropped in 1982 at the insistence of FIFA which threatened to withdraw recognition of the league if it did not apply all of the official rules of football.\n\nSubsequent developments: exceptions at the restart of play\nGoal kick\nSince the first FA laws of 1863, a player has not been penalised for being in an offside position at the moment a teammate takes a goal kick.  (According to the \"strict\" offside law used in 1863, every player on the attacking side would automatically have been in an offside position from such a goalkick, since it had to be taken from the goal line and a player could be in an offside position even when in their own half.)\n\nThrow-in\nUnder the original laws of 1863, it was not possible to be offside from a throw-in; however, since the ball was required to be thrown in at right-angles to the touch-line, it would have been unusual for a player to gain significant advantage from being ahead of the ball.\nIn 1877, the throw-in law was changed to allow the ball to be thrown in any direction.  The next year (1878) a new law was introduced to allow a player to be offside from a throw-in.\nThis situation lasted until 1920, when the law was altered to prevent a player being offside from a throw-in.  This rule-change was praised on the grounds that it would deter teams from \"seeking safety or wasting time by sending [the ball] into touch\", and thus reduce stoppages.\n\nCorner kick\nWhen first introduced in 1872, the corner kick was required to be taken from the corner-flag itself, which made it impossible for an attacking player to be in an offside position relative to the ball. In 1874, the corner-kick was allowed to be taken up to one yard from the corner-flag, thus opening up the possibility of a player being in an offside position.  At the International Football Conference of December 1882, it was agreed that a player should not be offside from a corner-kick; this change was incorporated into the Laws of the Game in 1883.\n\nFree kick\nThe laws of football have always permitted an offside offence to be committed from a free kick.  The free kick contrasts, in this respect, with other restarts of play such as the goal kick, corner kick, and throw-in.\nA 1920 proposal by the FA to exempt the free-kick from the offside rule was unexpectedly rejected by IFAB. A further unsuccessful proposal to remove the possibility of being offside from a direct free-kick was rejected in 1929. Similar proposals to prevent offside offences from any free-kick were advanced in 1974 and 1986, each time without success.  In 1987, the Football Association (FA) obtained the permission of IFAB to test such a rule in the 1987–88 GM Vauxhall Conference. At the next annual meeting, the FA reported to IFAB that the experiment had, as predicted, \"assisted further the non-offending team and also generated more action near goal, resulting in greater excitement for players and spectators\"; it nevertheless withdrew the proposal.\n\nOffside trap\nPioneered in the early 20th century by Notts County and later adopted by influential Argentine coach Osvaldo Zubeldía, the offside trap is a defensive tactic designed to force the attacking team into an offside position. Just before an attacking player is played a through ball, the last defender or defenders move upfield, isolating the attacker into an offside position. The execution requires careful timing by the defence and is considered a risk, since running upfield against the direction of attack may leave the goal exposed.  Now that changes to the interpretations of \"interfering with play, interfering with an opponent and gaining an advantage\" mean a player is not guilty of an offside offence unless they become directly and clearly involved in active play, players not involved in active play cannot be \"caught offside\", making the tactic riskier. An attacker, upon realising they are in an offside position, may simply choose to avoid interfering with play until the ball is played by someone else.\nManager Arrigo Sacchi was also known for using a high defensive line, with distance between the defence and midfield lines never greater than 25 to 30 metres (yards), and the offside trap with his teams. He introduced a more attacking–minded tactical philosophy with A.C. Milan, which was highly successful, namely an aggressive high-pressing system, which used a 4–4–2 formation, an attractive, fast, attacking, and possession-based playing style, and which also used innovative elements such as zonal marking and a high back–line line playing the offside trap, which largely deviated from previous systems in Italian football, despite still maintaining defensive solidity.\nLiverpool F.C. under Jürgen Klopp, a noted follower of Sacchi, were known for their highly effective offside trap. It involved playing a high defensive line with quick centre-backs like Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konaté who could move forward quickly to catch opponents offside. In the 2021–22 Premier League season, they caught 53% more the amount of opponents offside than the next best team (144 times compared to Manchester City's 94).\nNot all offside traps need to have a high line, the offside trap can be executed from everywhere on the pitch. Manuel Pellegrini often used the offside trap with the defenders sitting at the edge of their own box. The positioning of the defensive line dictates the available space that the opponents can run into. By adopting a high line, the opposition sometimes may be crammed into their own half, while a lower defensive line gives less space to run in behind.\n\nCitations\nGeneral and cited references\nWilson, Jonathan (2013) [2009].

The energy portfolio was formerly the provenance of the minister of energy between 2009 and 2019.\nDuring other periods, the energy portfolio was conjoined with other portfolios, including under the minister of minerals and energy, until 1994, and under the minister of mineral resources and energy from 2019 to 2024. The minister in the presidency responsible for electricity was appointed for the first time in March 2023 and had a mandate to oversee the government's response to the ongoing electricity crisis. \nThe incumbent minister of electricity and energy is Kgosientso Ramokgopa of the African National Congress, who was also the first and only minister in the presidency for electricity.\n\nPost-apartheid history\nIn the Government of National Unity (GNU) between 1994 and 1999, the energy portfolio was part of the brief of the minister of minerals and energy, a post that had also existed during apartheid. Pik Botha of the National Party was the minister between 1994 and 1996, making him the last politician to hold the office who was not a member of the African National Congress.\n\nZuma presidency: 2009–2018\nWhen he announced his first cabinet on 10 May 2009, President Jacob Zuma bifurcated the Department of Minerals and Energy into two disparate departments. The Department of Energy and Department of Mineral Resources were henceforth overseen by a minister of energy and minister of mineral resources respectively. The minister of energy gained a deputy minister from 31 October 2010. \nOver the next decade, during Zuma's presidency, the Ministry of Energy was frequently the target of cabinet reshuffles. Commentators linked the dismissals of energy ministers to Zuma's efforts to carry out a proposed nuclear power deal with Russia.\n\nRamaphosa presidency: 2018–present\nAppointing his second cabinet on 29 May 2019, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that the energy portfolio would be merged with the minerals portfolio, as it had been before Zuma's tenure. Soon after the ministries were merged into the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy, the respective departments were likewise merged into the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy.\nDuring his State of the Nation Address on 9 February 2023, Ramaphosa announced his intention to appoint a minister of electricity, based in the presidency, to oversee all aspects of the country's response to the ongoing electricity crisis, including leading the National Energy Crisis Committee. The first minister in the presidency for electricity, Kgosientso Ramokgopa, was appointed in a cabinet reshuffle on 6 March 2023. \nAmong other things, the minister of electricity had responsibility for procurement of new electricity generation capacity. However, he served alongside the incumbent mineral resources and energy minister, Gwede Mantashe, and there was uncertainty about the delineation of functions between them – especially given that a third minister, the minister of public enterprises, oversaw Eskom.\nOn 30 June 2024, appointing his third cabinet, Ramaphosa announced that the relevant ministries would be reconfigured: energy would be detached from the mineral resources portfolio and become the sole prerogative of a new minister of electricity and energy.\n\nList of ministers\nReferences\nExternal links\nMinistry of Electricity and Energy",
