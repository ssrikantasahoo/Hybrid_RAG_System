It is currently under development for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and sleep disorders. It is the active (R)-enantiomer of the formerly clinically used stimulant-like drug mesocarb (MLR-1017; brand name Sydnocarb). Pharmacology\nMesocarb is known to be a highly selective DRI. However, in 2021, it was discovered that mesocarb is not a conventional DRI but acts as a dopamine transporter (DAT) allosteric modulator or non-competitive inhibitor. In accordance with its nature as an atypical DAT blocker, the drug exhibits atypical effects compared to conventional DRIs. For example, mesocarb shows greater antiparkinsonian activity in animals compared to other DRIs. Mesocarb has wakefulness-promoting effects in animals. Armesocarb, as the active enantiomer of mesocarb, shows greater therapeutic potency than the racemic form in animals. In contrast, the (S)- or D-enantiomer of mesocarb is virtually inactive in animal behavioral tests. History\nArmesocarb was first described in the scientific literature as an enantiopure compound by 2005 and again in 2017.",

During the course of his career, Bruzenak has been closely associated with both Chaykin and Jim Steranko. Biography\nEarly life and career\nBruzenak grew up in Pennsylvania as a huge comic book fan. At age 17, he attended the Detroit Triple Fan Fair convention, where he met his hero Jim Steranko, and also crossed paths with Chaykin for the first time. Steranko\nAfter meeting Steranko a second time, Bruzenak took a job renovating Steranko's house in Reading, Pennsylvania. He stayed and worked at the house, along with another Steranko disciple, future comics artist Greg Theakston. Theakston was ostensibly there to assist Steranko on The Steranko History of Comics, volume two; Bruzenak was there to do construction. After about two years, Theakston left the project and Bruzenak took over as Steranko's primary assistant. During this period, Steranko formed Supergraphics, his own publishing company, where among other things he published the magazine Comixscene (later retitled Mediascene, and finally Prevue).",

Britain, the US, and the Soviet Union signed the Partial Test Ban Treaty in autumn 1963. Britain's application to join the Common Market was vetoed by French President Charles de Gaulle on 29 January 1963, in due to his fear that 'the end would be a colossal Atlantic Community dependent on America', and personal anger at the Anglo-American nuclear deal. Britain's balance of payments problems led to the imposition of a seven-month wage freeze in 1961. This caused the government to lose popularity and led to a series of by-election defeats.

Given its economic importance, the boundary of the Peak District National Park was carefully drawn to exclude the dale. By 1973, Tunstead was the largest quarry in Europe, and permission to extend it into the National Park was rejected on the grounds that there was sufficient stone to last until at least 2000. Following a Public Inquiry and a High Court case, the Secretary of State ultimately overrode the National Park Authority's decision and granted permission for a 148.57-hectare (367.1-acre) extension within the Peak District National Park. It remains the largest producer of limestone in the Peak District, with about 5.5 million tonnes extracted each year. In 1932, quarrying opened a fissure which contained remains of bison, Irish elk and deer, washed down from the surface in the distant past. In 1957, the painter Peter Lanyon visited the valley to study the faces of the quarry, seeing them as revealing both the geological and human history of the area.

The difficulties in the way of educating the children properly were great, owing to the constant coming and going, and owing also to the usually anemic condition of the children on their reception. It was managed, however, to keep each child up to its proper grade in school, so that it lost no time on its return to the city and was submitted to no undue strain. Infantorium\nIn the homes of over one-third of the children at the preventorium there were infants for whose case no institution in the city could be found. To test out the practicability of an  infantorium , an adjunct to the Farmingdale Preventorium with twelve cribs was opened and a report of the findings was made in January 1918. It was feared that mothers would be persuaded only with difficulty, if at all, to part with their babies for an extended period of time. However, it required very little persuasion to convince a tuberculous mother that she was putting her infant in harm's way, and to assure her of the advantages of separation from the baby as well as for herself.",

    "context_text": "Ventilative cooling is the use of natural or mechanical ventilation to cool indoor spaces. The use of outside air reduces the cooling load and the energy consumption of these systems, while maintaining high quality indoor conditions; passive ventilative cooling may eliminate energy consumption. Ventilative cooling strategies are applied in a wide range of buildings and may even be critical to realize renovated or new high efficient buildings and zero-energy buildings (ZEBs). Ventilation is present in buildings mainly for air quality reasons. It can be used additionally to remove both excess heat gains, as well as increase the velocity of the air and thereby widen the thermal comfort range. Ventilative cooling is assessed by long-term evaluation indices. Ventilative cooling is dependent on the availability of appropriate external conditions and on the thermal physical characteristics of the building. Background\nIn the last years, overheating in buildings has been a challenge not only during the design stage but also during the operation. The reasons are:\nHigh performance energy standards which reduce heating demand in heating dominated climates. Mainly refer to increase of the insulation levels and restriction on infiltration rates\nThe occurrence of higher outdoor temperatures during the cooling season, because of the climate change and the heat island effect not considered at the design phase\nInternal heat gains and occupancy behavior were not calculated with accuracy during the design phase (gap in performance).",

He also described what he saw as significant differences between the original Black Panthers and the New Black Panthers, particularly between their respective Ten-Point Programs. 2002 intimidation of original Panthers\nIn April 2002, an event was held in Washington, D.C. to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the creation of the Black Panther Party. Ron Scott, a co-founder of the Detroit chapter of the Panthers, was a guest speaker, and many in attendance were also original members of the Black Panther Party. During the course of the night, the event was interrupted by 30 members of the New Black Panther Party dressed in motorcycle helmets and steel-capped boots, led by Malik Zulu Shabazz. Shabazz and his NBPP member seized control of the event and ordered under threat of violence that the original Panthers cease criticism of the New Panthers.",

Following a formal request from the United States' Federal Bureau of Investigation that Kim Dotcom be extradited to the United States, the GCSB spied on Mr Dotcom in order to assist the FBI's request. However, as the GCSB did not have the legal authority to conduct surveillance, Justice Gilbert of the Court of Appeal, deemed unlawful.

Knowing that someone close to them wants love, approval or confirmation of identity and self-esteem, blackmailers may threaten to withhold them (e.g., withhold love) or take them away altogether, making the second person feel they must earn them by agreement. Fear, obligation or guilt is commonly referred to as  FOG . FOG is a contrived acronym a play on the word  fog  which describes something that obscures and confuses a situation or someone's thought processes. The person who is acting in a controlling way often wants something from the other person that is legitimate to want. They may want to feel loved, safe, valuable, appreciated, supported, needed, etc. This is not the problem. The problem is often more a matter of how they are going about getting what they want, or that they are insensitive to others' needs in doing so, and how others react to all of this. Under pressure, one may become a sort of hostage, forced to act under pressure of the threat of responsibility for the other's breakdown. One could fall into a pattern of letting the blackmailer control his her decisions and behavior, lost in what Doris Lessing described as  a sort of psychological fog .

Economically, Guan Zhong disbanded the well-field system instituted since the Zhou dynasty; instead, all land was to be taxed according to its productivity. At the same time, Qi's coastal position was exploited through the expansion of fisheries and salt production, while trade was encouraged through certain privileges. For instance, people bearing goods to market on foot, and carriages arriving empty at markets to make purchases, were not subject to tolls; this encouraged the use of the state-managed markets. Guan Zhong wrote that because taxation would reduce the people's wealth and make them dislike the government, it was better to obtain revenue by monopolizing the sale of salt, iron, forest products, and ore. Thus, these  goods of the mountains and seas  (namely iron and salt) should be state managed. Similarly, a price-regulation scheme existed for food, with granaries buying grain in bounty years to be released into the market in lean years.

Another unsubstantiated hypothesis is that the brontotheres died out due to a trypanosomiasis epidemic, caused by ancestors of the modern tsetse fly. Donald Prothero has attributed brontothere extinction to the Eocene Oligocene extinction event, when a period of glaciation coincided with extinctions in several different mammal groups. The temperature changes at the boundary between the Eocene and Oligocene dramatically impacted vegetation, leading to a large-scale replacement of Eocene forests, on which brontotheres depended, with savanna environments. The ecological niche of the brontotheres was later taken over by rhinoceros and elephants.

Since the white rose of the House of York is in the ascendant, Sir Daniel and his household are loyal to York and the white rose. The film takes place just before Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick's rebellion against Edward IV (1469 1471). Some twelve years prior to this Daniel, Oates, Sykes, and Appleyard perjured themselves to attaint a nobleman, who later would go by the name of  Black Arrow . He went to France in exile while his five-year-old daughter Joanna was made a ward of Sir Daniel. Black Arrow had not seen his daughter for twelve years since she had been kept in a convent during the wars.",

    "context_text": "RELA is expressed alongside p50 in various cell types, including epithelial endothelial cells and neuronal tissues. Structure\nRELA is one member of the NF-κB family, one of the essential transcription factors under intensive study. Seven proteins encoded by five genes are involved in the NF-κB complex, namely p105, p100, p50, p52, RELA, c-REL and RELB. Like other proteins in this complex, RELA contains a N-terminal REL-homology domain (RHD), and also a C-terminal transactivation domain (TAD). RHD is involved in DNA binding, dimerization and NF-κB REL inhibitor interaction. On the other hand, TAD is responsible for interacting with the basal transcription complex including many coactivators of transcription such as TBP, TFIIB and CREB-CBP. RELA and p50 is the mostly commonly found heterodimer complex among NF-κB homodimers and heterodimers, and is the functional component participating in nuclear translocation and activation of NF-κB. RELA is a 65 kDa protein. Phosphorylation\nPhosphorylation of RELA plays a key role in regulating NF-κB activation and function. Subsequent to NF-κB nuclear translocation, RELA undergoes site-specific post-translational modifications to further enhance the NF-κB function as a transcription factor.",

Like traditional schools, studio schools teach the National Curriculum and offer academic and vocational qualifications. However, studio schools also have links to employers and offer education related to work. Description\nStudio schools are a type of Free School, introduced in 2010. They are part of the Academies Programme, and are funded by the taxpayer, non-selective, free to attend and not controlled by a local education authority. While this is also true of most other academies and free schools, studio schools are collectively distinctive in a number of ways. Studio schools are sponsored by existing schools, colleges, and community groups. However, existing schools cannot convert to become a studio school - all studio schools have to be stand alone schools with no direct transfer intake of pupils. Studio schools are designed to be small, with a maximum of 300 students, which enables them to foster a supportive, personalised learning environment with a strong focus on pastoral care. The schools forge close links with businesses and enterprises in their specialist industries who support the schools through activities such as mentoring, work placements, and curriculum design and delivery. To further prepare students for the world of work, employability skills are embedded throughout all school activities using the CREATE employability skills framework.",

The Canadian Pacer influenced the Tennessee Walker, the American Saddlebred and the Standardbred.

Racing began in this area during the long, severe winters, when Sunday races after attending church for Mass became common. Eventually these races became large enough to endanger the church-going populace, and races were banned within a certain distance of churches. They instead moved to local rivers, whose smooth, frozen surfaces provided useful raceways, and the resulting contests drew attention to the pacers from Quebec. Several horses imported to the United States from Canada had a lasting impact on American horse breeding. In the early 1800s, a roan-coloured stallion named Copperbottom was imported to Lexington, Kentucky, from Quebec, through Michigan. He began to be offered for stud service in 1816, and his progeny spread throughout the eastern US. Known mainly as saddle stock, they also included several pacing horses. Another roan stallion, Tom Hal, a successful pacer in his own right, founded an important family of pacers in the US.",

He holds a reed cross in his left hand, while his right hand points up toward heaven, similar to the figure of Saint Anne in Leonardo's Burlington House Cartoon.

While they occasionally feed on reptiles, insects, and eggs, in experiments conducted during the 1970s, captive striped weasels did not attack or eat several genera of invertebrates (including various insects), reptiles, amphibians and chicken eggs offered to them, even while hungry. The weasels hunt primarily by scent, attacking prey with a sudden lunge and biting onto the back of the neck. After the initial strike, they roll around and kick the prey animal's back or pelvic region, perhaps in order to dislocate the prey's neck (as suggested in 1978 by South African researcher David T.

This usage dates from a historical period when classes and sets were not distinguished as they are in modern set-theoretic terminology. Many discussions of  classes  in the 19th century and earlier are really referring to sets, or rather perhaps take place without considering that certain classes can fail to be sets. Examples\nThe collection of all algebraic structures of a given type will usually be a proper class. Examples include the class of all groups, the class of all vector spaces, and many others. In category theory, a category whose collection of objects forms a proper class (or whose collection of morphisms forms a proper class) is called a large category. The surreal numbers are a proper class of objects that have the properties of a field. Within set theory, many collections of sets turn out to be proper classes. Examples include the class of all sets (the universal class), the class of all ordinal numbers, and the class of all cardinal numbers. One way to prove that a class is proper is to place it in bijection with the class of all ordinal numbers. This method is used, for example, in the proof that there is no free complete lattice on three or more generators.

This aspect of Megacerops anatomy has been compared to the vertebrae and neck musculature of modern bison. The neck itself was stout and moderately long. The vertebrae of Megacerops were somewhat similar to those of modern rhinoceros. The ribs were strong and massive. The pelvis of Megacerops was expanded transversely and wide, similar to elephant pelvises. The limbs of Megacerops were intermediate in proportion between those of modern rhinoceros and elephants. The limbs of show several adaptations to withstand the great weight of the animal. Compared to rhinoceros, Megacerops limbs are stouter, particularly at the ankles and wrists, and there is a lesser degree of angulations between the segments of the limbs. The forelimbs were especially robust and several adaptations, notably roughenings of the olecranon (the protruding part of the elbow) and the humerus, suggest great muscle power. Megacerops had four toes on its front feet and three toes on its rear feet. The arrangment of their feet bones indicate that Megacerops feet had a pad of elastic tissue, similar to the feet of modern elephants and rhinoceros.",

Many of the genetic mutations giving rise to syndromic deafness have been identified. In nonsyndromic cases, where deafness is the only finding, it is more difficult to identify the genetic mutation although some have been discovered. Gene mapping has identified the genetic locations for several nonsyndromic dominant (DFNA ) and recessive (DFNB ) forms of deafness. The first gene mapped for non-syndromic deafness, DFNA1, involves a splice site mutation in the formin-related homolog diaphanous 1 (DIAPH1). A single base change in a large Costa Rican family was identified as causative in a rare form of low-frequency onset progressive hearing loss with autosomal dominant inheritance exhibiting variable age of onset and complete penetrance by age 30. The most common type of congenital hearing loss in developed countries is DFNB1, also known as connexin 26 deafness or GJB2-related deafness. The most common dominant syndromic forms of hearing loss include Stickler syndrome and Waardenburg syndrome. The most common recessive syndromic forms of hearing loss are Pendred syndrome and Usher syndrome.",

The Marañón is one of the principal headwaters of the Amazon, descending from the Andes and contributing vast volumes of sediment and nutrients to the basin. The Pastaza River, originating in the Ecuadorian Andes, flows through diverse ecological zones ranging from montane forests to lowland floodplains, creating a mosaic of habitats that sustain high biodiversity. The Napo River, another major tributary of the Amazon, drains extensive areas of southeastern Ecuador and northern Peru, linking Andean watersheds with the lowland Amazon system. Together, these rivers form critical corridors for aquatic dispersal and genetic exchange, supporting rich assemblages of Neotropical fishes. The species  distribution across these interconnected basins underscores its adaptation to varied hydrological regimes and situates it within one of the most ecologically significant regions of the western Amazon.

A team at the University of Tübingen analyzed tuberculosis DNA in 1,000-year-old skeletons of the Chiribaya culture in southern Peru; so much genetic material was recovered that they could reconstruct the genome. They learned that this TB strain was related most closely to a form found only in seals. In South America, it was likely contracted first by hunters who handled contaminated meat. This TB is a different strain from that prevalent today in the Americas, which is more closely related to a later Eurasian strain. Prior to this study, the first evidence of the disease in South America was found in remains of the Arawak culture around 1050 BC. The most significant finding belongs to the mummy of an 8- to 10-year-old Nascan child from Hacienda Agua Sala, dated to 700 AD. Scientists were able to isolate evidence of the bacillus.

Meanwhile, the small Labour minority in Parliament was sympathetic to the Congress movement led by Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru. Decolonisation was never a major election issue; Labour was not officially in favour of decolonisation when it was elected in 1945. With violence escalating in India after the war, but with British financial power at a low ebb, large-scale military involvement was impossible. The Viceroy of India warned he needed a further seven army divisions to prevent communal violence if independence negotiations failed. None were available, so political restructuring was accelerated. The Labour government gave independence to India and Pakistan in an unexpectedly quick move in 1947. One recent historian and Conservative party sympathiser Andrew Roberts says the independence of India was a  national humiliation  but it was necessitated by urgent financial, administrative, strategic and political needs.

Several witnesses reported a car and a pickup truck fell into the river, however only the two occupants of the car were recovered, no other vehicles were found and no other persons were ever reported missing. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the probable cause of the temporary bridge collapse was the selection by the Hamilton County Engineer's Office of a design by the National Engineering and Contracting Company that did not consider lateral loads and the failure of the Hamilton County Engineer's Office to promptly close the bridge when it became subject to significant debris loading. Contributing to the cause of the collapse was the failure of the Hamilton County Engineer's Office to submit the bridge design plans to the Ohio Department of Transportation for review as required by state law. The one-lane bridge was intended to carry U.S. 52 traffic while a replacement for the 93-year-old Miamitown Bridge was being built.

When startled, African striped weasels attempt to flee by escaping into a hole, or (according to anecdotal evidence) occasionally by climbing up trees. If unable to flee, the animal may emit a sound similar to a growl or shriek while raising its tail and making fake charges at the perceived threat. If this fails, the weasel may spray a yellowish, musky fluid from its perineal glands that can be ejected up to 1 m (3 ft 3 in) away. Though this fluid has a heavy, sweet and pungent smell which has been described as  foul , it apparently is not nauseating and less persistent than the similar secretions of skunks and striped polecats. Conservation\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) first assessed the African striped weasel in 1996 and listed it as a Least Concern species on the IUCN Red List, with the same listing given in subsequent assessments in 2008 and 2015, citing that although it is not commonly seen, it has a wide distribution and habitat tolerance.

History\nAs futsal began to gain popularity in Nepal, the ANFA formed its first-ever national team in 2017 to enter 2018 AFC Futsal Championship qualification. Former Nepal international footballer Rakesh Shrestha was selected to lead the team in qualification as its first-ever head coach. The team lost its maiden international fixture 1 14 to Uzbekistan to open their qualifying campaign. Captain Suraj Raut scored the team's only goal and the team's first-ever tally. Nepal was invited to Pakistan in February 2018 to compete in the International Soccer Futsal Cup 2018. The tournament marked the first time that international futsal had been played in the country. In preparation for the tournament, Nep defeated the hosts 7 5 in a friendly on 13 February. In 2019, Nepal was invited to participate in the 2019 AMF Futsal Men's World Cup. The team were defeated in all three of its Group Stage matches. It was drawn into Group D along with the United States, France, and Catalonia.",
