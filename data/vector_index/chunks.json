    "text": "The Duke of Edinburgh's International Award Canada is the Canadian branch of The Duke of Edinburgh's Award, a personal achievement program available to people in Canada between the ages of 14 and 25. As of 2020, over 500,000 had earned the award. Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh is patron of The Duke of Edinburgh's International Award.\nConcept\nThe Duke of Edinburgh's Award was created by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, then the consort of Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada, with the intent of encouraging young people to set and achieve their own goals and challenges. There are three levels bronze, silver, and gold but, no competition between participants, as it is a personal achievement program, and there are no set standards to measure achievements; the criteria are based on each participant's improvement and growth. Participants must set goals in multiple program areas: service, skills, physical recreation, an adventurous journey, and an additional project.\nHistory\nThe award was launched in Canada in 1963 and opened up to all young Canadians between the ages of 14 and 24. Pilot projects were launched in various cities in Nova Scotia, Ontario, and British Columbia. The following year, one of the first award ceremonies was held, with 48 bronze and six silver awards presented, and the first Gold Award ceremony took place in Ottawa in 1968, when The Duke of Edinburgh presented 18 recipients with their Gold Awards.\nBy 1986, the award was operating in Newfoundland,",

In 2018, over 42,000 Canadians participated in the award. Nationally, the program has developed several initiatives to expand the award so it becomes more accessible to at-risk youth, inner-city youth, young offenders, youth with disabilities, as well as northern and aboriginal youth.\nThe award in Canada is associated with the Duke of Edinburgh's International Foundation. In 1967, Canada hosted the first International Gold Event in 1967. Twenty-one years later, Canada became a founding member of the Duke of Edinburgh's Award International Association and is currently one of the four largest national award authorities. In 2002, Canada hosted its second international gold event, Rendezvous 2002.\nFollowing the death of Prince Philip in 2021, his youngest son, Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh, was made patron of The Duke of Edinburgh's International Award, announced on 14 March 2023, four days after his oldest brother, Charles III, King of Canada, created him Duke of Edinburgh.

    "text": "The Old Wives' Tale is a novel by Arnold Bennett, first published in January 1908. It deals with the lives of two very different sisters, Constance and Sophia Baines, following their stories from their youth, working in their mother's draper's shop, into old age. It covers a period of approximately 65 years roughly from 1840 to 1905, and is set in Bursley (modeled on Burslem) and Paris. It is generally regarded as one of Bennett's finest works. \nBennett was initially inspired to write the book by a chance encounter in a Parisian restaurant. In the introduction to the book, he says\n...an old woman came into the restaurant to dine. She was fat, shapeless, ugly, and grotesque. She had a ridiculous voice, and ridiculous gestures. It was easy to see that she lived alone, and that in the long lapse of years she had developed the kind of peculiarity which induces guffaws among the thoughtless.\nand\nI reflected, concerning the grotesque diner:  This woman was once young, slim, perhaps beautiful; certainly free from these ridiculous mannerisms. Very probably she is unconscious of her singularities. Her case is a tragedy. One ought to be able to make a heartrending novel out of the history of a woman such as she.  Every stout, ageing woman is not grotesque far from it! but there is an extreme path",

    "text": "ities. Her case is a tragedy. One ought to be able to make a heartrending novel out of the history of a woman such as she.  Every stout, ageing woman is not grotesque far from it! but there is an extreme pathos in the mere fact that every stout ageing woman was once a young girl with the unique charm of youth in her form and movements and in her mind. And the fact that the change from the young girl to the stout ageing woman is made up of an infinite number of infinitesimal changes, each unperceived by her, only intensifies the pathos.\nBennett also found inspiration in Maupassant's novel Une Vie.\nSynopsis\nThe book is divided into four parts. The first section,  Mrs Baines , details the adolescence of both Sophia and Constance, and their life in their father's shop and house (a combined property) in Bursley, a lightly dramatised version of Burslem. The father is ill and bedridden, and the main adult in their life is Mrs Baines, their mother.\nBy the end of the first book, the more adventurous and frivolous sister, Sophia (whose name reflects her sophistication, as opposed to the constant Constance), escapes Bursley to London and elopes with the travelling salesman, Gerald Scales, against her family s wishes. Sophia and her husband alight to Paris and she leaves her family behind, ashamed that the money she used to find",

Sophia and her husband alight to Paris and she leaves her family behind, ashamed that the money she used to find her freedom was stolen from her wealthy aunt. Constance meanwhile becomes engaged to Mr. Samuel Povey, who works in the shop.\nThe second part,  Constance , details the life of Constance from that point forward up until the time she is reunited with her sister in old age. Her life, although outwardly prosaic, is nevertheless filled with personal incident, including the birth of her son, Cyril; the execution of her brother-in-law, Daniel Povey, who had accidentally killed his alcoholic wife; and the subsequent death of her husband, Samuel, whose health fell into rapid disrepair after his brother s conviction; and her concerns about the character and behaviour of her son, who nevertheless performs well enough at school to win a competitive and coveted scholarship, which takes him away from home.\nThe third part,  Sophia , carries forward the story of what happened to Sophia after her elopement. Initially living off her husband, Gerald Scales,  12,000 inheritance, Gerald irresponsibly squanders the sum in a couple of years and runs off, insolvent.

Abandoned by her husband in Paris, Sophia shrewdly survives the Siege of Paris and the Paris Commune using a small sum of money she stole from Gerald before his insolvency and eventually becomes the reputable owner of a successful pension.\nThe final part,  What Life Is , details how the two sisters are eventually reunited and reflects upon how their lives and fates, despite the vast difference in their demeanor, end up in the same town that had connected them from birth, even as the very character of the town changes underneath them. Sophia returns to England and the house of her childhood, where Constance has never left. The last part follows both sisters until their deaths, with Constance s death coming after she mustered her last physical strength to vote against the federation of Bursley and the Five Towns into a combined city, with deleterious effects on Bursley s aged city center. The vote fails, a seeming victory for Constance, who passes away. After her death, a loophole is discovered that invalidates the vote, and Bursley is federated with its neighboring cities, a dramatised version of what is today Stoke-upon-Trent.\nDetails and legacy\nAccording to Tom Wolfe (Hooking Up, p. 148), the book was  wildly successful,  with the author demurring with  I don't read my reviews",

The Italian text is an extensive revision of the libretto by Metastasio first set by Antonio Caldara in 1736, by Mattia Verazi, court poet and private secretary to the Elector Palatine Carl Theodor. The opera was the first of two which J. C. Bach set for the Elector Palatine. Some of the music was reused from earlier works, including part of the overture from Carattaco (composed in London in 1767).\nPerformance history\nTemistocle was first performed at the Court Theatre in Mannheim on 4 November 1772, with a notable cast including Anton Raaff and Dorothea and Elisabeth Wendling, all singers that later worked with Mozart.\nRoles\nSynopsis\nThe opera takes place in Persia. Temistocle, together with his son Neocle, has been expelled from Athens. He arrives incognito at Susa, the capital of his arch-enemy King Serse, to find that his daughter Aspasia (in love with the Athenian ambassador Lisimaco) has also made her way there, following a shipwreck.

The chapel of Saint Mary was built after the plague of 1676. The chapel experienced major restructuring in 1961 when it was enlarged to accommodate the increasing population of the area. This was done on the initiative of Rev. Salv Farrugia.At the present day the church is being taken care of by the Kumitat Pastorali ta' Bubaqra.\nNigret Chapel dedicated to the Immaculate conception of Mary\nThe present church was built on the site of a previous chapel dedicated to the Annunciation which was deconsecrated by Bishop Miguel Juan Balaguer Camarasa on 24 November 1658.

During Monsignor Pietro Dusina's apostolic visit to Ħal-Millieri, in 1575, he found that there were a total of four churches in the area. Only two of these remain standing; the Annunciation and Saint John the Evangelist. During his visit, Dusina found that the church was in a state of good repair, had three altars and paved. However, he found that the church was not equipped with sacred vestments, income or even a rector.\nChapel of Saint John the Evangelist in Ħal-Millieri\nThe original medieval chapel dedicated to Saint John was built sometime around 1481. It is recorded in inquisitor Pietro Dusina's report of his apostolic visit to the chapel in 1575. The report states that the chapel was in a dilapidated state, there were no doors, there were stone benches and a floor of beaten earth. Consequently, the church was deconsecrated.

Santiam Academy was created on January 18, 1854, by an act of the Oregon Territorial Legislature, and a larger building was constructed between 1854 and 1856. Among the members of the first board of trustees were Delazon Smith and David W. Ballard.\nAttendance at the school dropped after the establishment of a public school district in 1870, and the academy shut down during the 1903 1904 school year. The church then turned the property over to the Lebanon School District. The building was torn down in the 1930s; in 1945, Santiam School was built on the site, across from Lebanon High School. Santiam School closed in 1982 and was torn down in 2002. The site is now a Lebanon city park.\nNotable alumni\nOwen Nickerson Denny, judge, United States consul general to China, introduced the ring-necked pheasant to the U.S.\nMelvin Clark George, U.S. Representative\nWill Orian  O.W.

    "text": "Aycliffe Stadium was a sports facility located in County Durham, England, on the southern edge of the Aycliffe Industrial Estate, which has Newton Aycliffe to the North and Aycliffe Village to the South. The stadium was originally used for greyhound racing and then speedway before stock car racing.\nStock Cars\nIt was a short (370 yard) oval tarmac race track, which was used for stock car racing from the mid-1950s until it was closed at the end of 1989. The most regular formula to appear at Aycliffe Stadium was the BriSCA Formula 1 Stock Cars, closely followed by the smaller BriSCA Formula 2 Stock Cars category. National Saloon Stock Car Racing and Banger racing were also regularly held at Aycliffe, along with the occasional Demolition Derby, and the occasional demonstration visit from Autograss formula and Hot Rods (oval racing). The site was used each year for the town's firework display on Guy Fawkes Night.\nFor many Aycliffe is remembered as the Action Track. Aycliffe's tight corners and its suspended steel rope fence, combined with BriSCA's brand of contact racing regularly produced an action-packed spectacle. For most of its history, the stadium was associated with the British Stock Car Association (BriSCA).

The first BriSCA licensed race took place on 10 July 1966, and the final BriSCA event was held on 19 November 1989.\nOn Good Friday, 16 April 1954, the first stock car race in Great Britain took place in London at New Cross Stadium. The sport was an instant success and races took place all over the country. Until recently, it is widely believed that the first Stock Car meeting at Aycliffe took place on 7 October 1956. However, photographs from 1955 of a driver's presentation evening at the North Briton Pub (in Aycliffe Village) suggest that stock car racing had already taken place at Aycliffe in 1955. In 1957, Jimmy Wilkinson took over as the promoter at Aycliffe. He retained control of the stadium until 1964, when he handed the role of promoter over to three regular Aycliffe drivers - Tony Neal (100), Ron 'Dixie' Dean (20), and Tom Geldard (154).\nIn 1966, the three brought Aycliffe Stadium into the BriSCA organisation.

The village lies on the edge of the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia.\nThe name of the village is derived from German personal name Bruno.\nHistory\nIt was first mentioned in a written document in 1566 as Braune. Politically the village belonged then to the Duchy of Teschen, a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg monarchy. In 1572, it was sold together with Bielsko and a dozen surrounding villages by dukes of Cieszyn and split from their duchy to form Bielsko state country (since 1754 Duchy of Bielsko).\nAfter Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political and legal district of Bielsko. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910, the population of the municipality grew from 731 in 1880 to 749 in 1910 with a majority being native Polish-speakers (98.1  100 ) accompanied by a small German-speaking minority (at most 14 or 1.9  in 1880), in terms of",

Contributing to the cause of the collapse was the failure of the Hamilton County Engineer's Office to submit the bridge design plans to the Ohio Department of Transportation for review as required by state law.\nThe one-lane bridge was intended to carry U.S. 52 traffic while a replacement for the 93-year-old Miamitown Bridge was being built.

The Bank of England, railways, heavy industry and coal mining were all nationalised. Unlike the others, the most controversial issue was nationalisation of steel, which was profitable. Economic recovery was slow, housing was in short supply and bread was rationed along with many necessities in short supply. It was an  age of austerity . American loans and Marshall Plan grants kept the economy afloat. India, Pakistan, Burma and Ceylon gained independence. Britain was a strong anti-Soviet factor in the Cold War and helped found NATO in 1949. Many historians describe this era as the  post-war consensus , emphasising how both the Labour and Conservative Parties until the 1970s tolerated or encouraged nationalisation, strong trade unions, heavy regulation, high taxes, and generous welfare state.\nThe Labour Party introduced charges for NHS dental services and glasses in 1951. The Conservatives returned to power in 1951, accepting most of Labour's post-war reforms but introducing prescription charges to the NHS in 1952 and denationalising steel in 1953.

The party quickly nationalised critical sectors of the economy, especially declining industries. The Bank of England was nationalised along with railways (see Transport Act 1947), coal mining, public utilities and heavy industry. The most controversial case was the takeover of the highly profitable iron and steel industry, which was opposed and finally reversed by the Conservatives.\nWelfare state\nA comprehensive welfare state was created with the National Insurance Act 1946, in which people in work paid a flat rate of National Insurance. In return, they (and the wives of male contributors) were eligible for flat-rate pensions, sickness benefit, unemployment benefit, and funeral benefits. Various other pieces of legislation provided for child benefit and support for people with no other source of income.\nIn the estimation of historians, and later politicians of the major parties, the most successful and permanent program was the creation of a National Health Service which started operations in 1947. It entitled all citizens to healthcare, which, funded by taxation, was free at the point of delivery.

Michael Foot adds that Bevan had to persuade  the most conservative and respected profession in the country to accept and operate the Labour government's most intrinsically socialist proposition.  In the end historians give Bevan the major credit for the success.\nOne of the main achievements of Attlee's government was the maintenance of near full employment. The government maintained most of the wartime controls over the economy, including control over the allocation of materials and manpower, and unemployment rarely rose above 500,000, or 3  of the total workforce. In fact labour shortages proved to be more of a problem. One area where the government was not quite as successful was in housing, which was also the responsibility of Aneurin Bevan.

John Maynard Keynes argued the only solution was to drastically cut back the spending on the British Empire, which amounted to  2,000 million. The post-war overseas deficit was  1,400 million, warned Keynes. and,  it is this expenditure which is wholly responsible for either financial difficulties.  Both Churchill and Attlee ignored his advice and kept spending heavily, in part by borrowing from India. The United States provided a large 50-year loan in 1946, and the sudden grant of independence to India and Pakistan in 1947 sharply cut expenses. Marshall Plan money began flowing in 1948, and by the time it ended in 1951 the financial crisis was over.

Britain now shed traditional overseas military roles as fast as possible. American financial aid was available on Washington's terms, as seen in the 1945 loan, the convertibility of sterling crisis of 1947, the devaluation of sterling in 1949, and the rearmament program in support of the U.S. in the Korean War, 1950 53. On the other hand, he had some success in convincing Washington to take over roles that were too expensive for Britain, including the rebuilding of the European economy and supporting anti-communist governments in Greece and elsewhere.

Meanwhile, the small Labour minority in Parliament was sympathetic to the Congress movement led by Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru. Decolonisation was never a major election issue; Labour was not officially in favour of decolonisation when it was elected in 1945. With violence escalating in India after the war, but with British financial power at a low ebb, large-scale military involvement was impossible. The Viceroy of India warned he needed a further seven army divisions to prevent communal violence if independence negotiations failed. None were available, so political restructuring was accelerated. The Labour government gave independence to India and Pakistan in an unexpectedly quick move in 1947. One recent historian and Conservative party sympathiser Andrew Roberts says the independence of India was a  national humiliation  but it was necessitated by urgent financial, administrative, strategic and political needs. Whereas Churchill in 1940 45 had tightened the hold on India and imprisoned the Congress leadership, Labour had looked forward to making it a fully independent dominion like Canada or Australia. Many of the Congress leaders in India had studied in England, and were highly regarded as fellow idealistic socialists by Labour leaders.

The new Viceroy was Lord Mountbatten, the dashing war hero and a cousin of King George VI. The boundary between the newly created states of Pakistan and India involved the widespread resettlement of millions of Muslims and Hindus (and many Sikhs). Extreme violence ensued when Punjab and Bengal provinces were split. Historian Yasmin Khan estimates that between a half-million and a million men, women and children were killed. Gandhi himself was assassinated by a Hindu Mahasabha activist in January 1948. Popular and elite opinion in Britain at the time did not view Indian independence as a humiliation but as a successful completion of a process long underway, and strongly supported by Labour and indeed most of the Conservative party as well. A major reason that Churchill was in the wilderness during the 1930s was his refusal to support the Conservative position in favor of independence for India.

The U.S. provided a loan of  3.75 billion (US 57 billion in 2017) at a low 2  interest rate; Canada loaned an additional US 1.19 billion (US 16 billion in 2017).

U.S. President Truman was reluctant to agree, placing a much higher priority on the Korean War. Churchill's return to power and Dwight D.

When these demands were rejected, more radical elements came forward, launching the Mau Mau rebellion in 1952.

Eden was a very popular figure, as a result of his long wartime service and also his famous good looks and charm. On taking office he immediately called a general election, at which the Conservatives were returned with an increased majority. He left domestic issues to his lieutenants such as Rab Butler, and concentrated largely on foreign policy, forming a close alliance with US President Dwight D.

It had been owned and controlled by Britain since 1875 and was seen as essential to national defence and access to the Far East. Eden drawing on his experience in the 1930s, saw Nasser as another Mussolini who had to be stopped.

Macmillan brushed aside this incident as 'a little local difficulty'.\nMacmillan wanted the new National Incomes Commission to institute controls on income as part of his growth without inflation policy; it failed when the trade unions boycotted it.\nOne of Macmillan's more noteworthy actions was the end of conscription. National Service ended gradually from 1957; in November 1960 the last men entered service.

His understanding of economics was primitive, and he gave his chancellor Reginald Maudling free rein to handle financial affairs.

Criticism came primarily from Labour. In addition there were attacks by the right wing of the Conservative Party itself for its tolerance of socialist policies. The critics contend that Britain was overtaken by its economic competitors, and was unable to prevent a troublesome wage-price upward spiral. Historian Graham Goodlad calls for taking a longer perspective. He argues that there were significant advances in transport, healthcare, and higher education. It is unrealistic to expect that Britain could have continued as a world power after the huge expense of the Second World War, and the independence of India and other colonies. Goodlad says the Conservative foreign-policy leadership properly adjusted Britain's world role by building an independent nuclear capacity and maintaining a leading role in world affairs, and anyway successive governments seldom did a better job.\nLabour Government, 1964 1970\nHarold Wilson\nIn 1964, Labour regained the premiership, as Harold Wilson narrowly won the general election",

This was not sufficient to last for a full term and, after a short period of competent government, in March 1966, he won re-election with a landslide majority of 99. As prime minister, his opponents accused him of deviousness, especially over the matter of devaluation of the pound in November 1967. Wilson had rejected devaluation for many years, yet in his broadcast had seemed to present it as a triumph.\nOpen University\nWilson regarded with special pride setting up the Open University as a model for Europe. Plans were drafted by Jennie Lee, the Minister for the Arts; she had Wilson's full support. He saw the Open University as a major marker of the Labour Party's commitment to modernisation. He emphasised that it would strengthen a more competitive economy while also fostering greater equality of opportunity and social mobility. He especially favoured heavy use of technology, such as television and radio broadcast of its courses.

Lyndon Johnson is begging me even to send a bagpipe band to Vietnam,  Wilson told his Cabinet in December 1964. Labour decided not to antagonise its strong antiwar element and refused Johnson's pleas. However, Wilson provided the Americans with intelligence, military weapons, and jungle training, and allowed some 2000 British soldiers to volunteer for service in Vietnam.\nIndustrial strike\nIn addition to the damage done to its reputation by devaluation, Wilson's Government suffered from the perception that its response to industrial relations problems was inadequate. A six-week strike of members of the National Union of Seamen, which began shortly after Wilson' re-election in 1966, did much to reinforce this perception, along with Wilson's own sense of insecurity in office.\nConservative Government, 1970 1974\nEdward Heath\nThe premiership of his successor, Edward Heath was the bloodiest in the history of the Northern Ireland Troubles.

In 2003, he gave evidence to the Saville Inquiry and claimed that he never promoted or agreed to the use of unlawful lethal force in Northern Ireland. In July 1972, he permitted his Secretary of State for Northern Ireland William Whitelaw to hold unofficial talks in London with a Provisional Irish Republican Army delegation by Seán Mac Stíofáin. In the aftermath of these unsuccessful talks, the Heath government pushed for a peaceful settlement with the democratic political parties. In 1974, the Sunningdale Agreement was produced but fiercely repudiated by many Unionists and the Ulster Unionist Party ceased to support the Conservatives at Westminster.\nHeath took the United Kingdom into the European Communities, widely known at the time as the  Common Market  (later renamed the European Union) on 1 January 1973 after winning a decisive vote on membership in the House by 336 244, a majority of 112.

In an attempt to bolster his government, Heath called an election for 28 February 1974. The result was inconclusive: the Conservative Party received a plurality of votes cast, but the Labour Party gained a plurality of seats due to the Ulster Unionist MPs refusing to support the Conservatives.

    "text": "The Nigerian Television Authority or NTA is a Nigerian government-owned and partly commercial broadcast station. Originally known as Nigerian Television (NTV), it was inaugurated in 1977 with a monopoly on national television broadcasting, after a takeover of regional television stations by military governmental authorities in 1976. After a declining interest from the public in government-influenced programming, it lost its monopoly over television broadcasting in Nigeria in the 1990s.\nThe NTA runs the largest television network in Nigeria with stations in several parts of the country. It is widely viewed as the  authentic voice  of the Nigerian government.\nHistory\nEarly broadcast stations in Nigeria\nThe first television station in Nigeria, the Western Nigerian Government Broadcasting Corporation (WNTV) began broadcasting on 31 October 1959. Its first Chairman was Olapade Obisesan, a lawyer trained in the United Kingdom and the son of Akinpelu Obisesan, an Ibadan socialite and first president of the Cooperative Bank of Nigeria. Vincent Maduka, a former engineer, was the General Manager. The station was based in Ibadan, making it the first broadcast station in tropical Africa.\nIn March 1962, Radio-Television Kaduna Radio Kaduna Television (RKTV) was established. It was based in Kaduna and was operated by the Broadcasting Company of Northern Nigeria. RKTV also provided coverage for the central northern states; it opened new stations on Zaria in July 1962",

RKTV also provided coverage for the central northern states; it opened new stations on Zaria in July 1962 and on Kano in February 1963. Later in 1977, it was re-branded NTV-Kaduna.\nIn April 1962, the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) was established as a federal government-owned service based in the city of Lagos, broadcasting to the southwestern states.\nMidWest TV was established in 1972 as a TV broadcaster of Port Harcourt. It was run by the state government in Benin.\nBenue-Plateau Television Corporation (BPTV) was established in 1974 with headquarters in Jos. It was the first television station to launch regular permanent colour broadcasts in Africa. The colour test transmissions began on 1 October 1975. BPTV was later re-branded as NTV-Jos.\nNTA was founded in 1977. By May 1977 all the state television broadcasters listed above were merged and re-branded as Nigerian Television (NTV) and owned by the Nigerian Television Authority. Obisesan and Makuda continued in the roles of Chairman and General Manager of NTA. As of 1979, NTA had a national reach of 20  of the Nigerian population.\nEarly programming\n1977 1990: Networking locally produced content",

As of 1979, NTA had a national reach of 20  of the Nigerian population.\nEarly programming\n1977 1990: Networking locally produced content\nDramatic programming such as serials and anthology series were rare in regional television stations before NTA was founded in 1977. TV shows such as Moses Olaiya's Alawada on WNTV (later NTA Ibadan), Village Headmaster and Hotel de Jordan on NTA Benin became available more widely after the merger. Apart from these few notable shows, there was little original content in dramatic series production during the 1970s. By 1980, when the new NTA network took over state-owned broadcasting stations in the country, there was a concerted effort to increase the quality of locally produced content. NTA began offering support to the production of notable country-wide network programs such as Tales by Moonlight, Cockcrow at Dawn, and Mirror in the Sun as early as 1977. In 1982, a drama produced by NTA Sokoto, Moment of Truth won a prize at the fifth URTNA festival held in Algiers. \nTo cultivate interest in original broadcast content from Nigerian producers, the network set a ceiling of 20  broadcasting time to be allocated to foreign programming, during a period when the cost of acquiring those programs was much less than the locally produced ones.

With just a portion of the broadcast week for schedulers to work with, foreign imports were routinely some of the most popular shows from the UK and the U.S., such as Yes Minister, Charlie's Angels, Dallas, Dynasty, and Falcon Crest. Cockcrow at Dawn, an agriculture promotional drama partially sponsored by UBA and produced by Peter Igho, who directed the award-winning Moment of Truth, emerged as one of the first nationally televised drama series in Nigeria. However, it was short-lived due to  government structure syndrome . Acada Campus, a show produced by Bode Sowande, was also short-lived. These series were widely available thanks to NTA's monopoly on broadcasting.\nIn the 1980s, a series of critically acclaimed soap operas were promoted on the network. The first was Laolu Ogunniyi's Wind Against My Soul, followed by For Better or Worse and Lola Fani Kayode's Mirror in the Sun. The last of these, produced in 1983, was well-received by critics, but its broadcast was interrupted after two years due to a lack of financial support.

The network also broadcast Adelia Onyedibia's adaptation of Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart in 1986.\nThe network also promoted notable comedy series during this period such as New Masquerade and Ken Saro Wiwa's Basi and Company. One of the earliest network comedies was House no. 13 (1984) starring Wale Ogunyemi;, a sitcom satirizing the social and urban lifestyle of Nigerians. Basi and Company, a critically acclaimed comedy series starring Albert Egbe was broadcast in 1985. Village Headmaster, Koko Close and Samanja, three series spoken in Nigerian Pidgin, were aired nationwide.\n1990s: Partial commercialization\nUnder the structural adjustment program initiated by the government of Ibrahim Babangida, NTA was required to commercialize some of its time slots in an attempt to move away from public broadcasting towards a partially commercial broadcasting network. This led to the addition of sponsored and brokered religious programs and the live transmission of weddings and funeral services on the network.\nNT",

Ripples, which began in 1988, became the network's longest-running soap opera, ending in 1993. Checkmate by Amaka Igwe, starring Richard Mofe Damijo, Bob-Manuel Udokwu, Ego Boyo, Kunle Bamtefa and Mildred Iweka, launched the career of many Nigerian celebrities. Following the end of Ripples and Checkmate, NTA promoted the shows Blossom and Fortunes, but these series suffered from declining viewership. At this time NTA, which previously had a broadcast monopoly, faced competition from new entrants such as Africa Independent Television. To compete, the network introduced prime time Latin American telenovelas such as The Rich Also Cry, Secrets of the Sand and Wild Rose.\nProgramming for children or for education usually occurred between 06:30 pm and 07:00 pm. Shows included Fun time, Readers club, Work it Out, and Take a Step.\nIn 1999, the network introduced breakfast television with A.M. Express.\n",

The network ensured that news presenters did not simply read prepared scripts but acted as part of the news gathering team. As many of their early news writers came from print journalism, NTA made sure that writers understood the importance of writing for visual presentation. NTA introduced a new line of newscasters and reporters such as Ronke Ayuba, John Momoh, Cyril Stober, Bimbo Oloyede, Ruth Opia, Sienne Allwell-Brown and Sola Omole. Specialized news programmes like Frank Olise's Newsline were also introduced. The major news programmes were the Network News at Nine, a 5-minute News in Brief at 5:00 pm, and a 15-minute Newscap at 11:00 pm.\nIn the 1990s, NTA joined other state-owned stations in commercialising some aspects of news reporting by including festivals, social events, cultural and business activities in the news or as part of a news programme in return for the payment of a fee.\n21st Century programming\nAs of 2013, mandatory network programming dominated the airtime of most local NTA",

NTA has faced criticism that the content it covers is influenced by government and politicians. This interference is said to diminish the professionalism of newscasters on NTA.\nThe NTA has been criticized by performing artists such as Becky Umeh for allegedly pressuring her and other artists to align their expression with government propaganda goals. In an editorial on 18 October 2009, the Lagos newspaper The Guardian stated that  the federal government-owned television network, the Nigerian Television Authority, (NTA) is arguably the largest of its type in Africa, but it is yet to have the operational freedom required to maximize its potential. \nIt has been suggested that the proliferation of NTA stations in every state capital is not useful for broadcasting but is driven by political reasons. The network has also been criticized for using antiquated technology.\nRelated services\nNTA's digital Pay TV service, Startimes, was established in 2010 as a partnership with Star Communications Technology of China.

    "text": "The 16th National Basketball Association All-Star Game was played on January 11, 1966, at Cincinnati Gardens in Cincinnati. The coaches were Red Auerbach for the East, and Fred Schaus for the West. Much of the game would focus around the local team's three named All-Stars. Cincinnati's Oscar Robertson had been named the event's MVP in 1964, and Cincinnati's Jerry Lucas had been named MVP in 1965. At game time, the East Division's top three teams, Boston, Philadelphia and Cincinnati, had the three best records in the league, with New York trailing far behind. This led East Coach Red Auerbach to name Cincinnati's Adrian Smith as a reserve and not New York's sharpshooting Dick Barnett, a source of some controversy at the time. The home crowd rallied behind Smith as he emerged as the game's star. It was Smith's only All-Star appearance, and he remains to-date the only one-time NBA All-Star ever named the event's MVP. The overmatched West suffered not just from poor shooting, but also from losing key All-Star Jerry West to an eye injury in the first quarter. The game was nationally televised, with an attendance of 13,653.\nEastern Division\nWestern Division\nScore by periods\nHalftime  East, 63 36\nThird Quarter  East, 101 68\nOfficials: Norm Drucker and John Vanak\nAttendance: 13,653.\nReferences\nThe Official NBA Basketball Encyclopedia.

Key Club International is the high school branch of the Kiwanis International family, classified as a Service Leadership Program and more specifically as a Kiwanis Youth Program. Many Key Clubs are sponsored by a local Kiwanis club.\nThe organization was started by California State Commissioner of Schools Albert C. Olney and vocational education teacher Frank C. Vincent, who worked together to establish the first Key Club at Sacramento High School in California on May 7, 1925. Female students were first admitted in 1977, ten years before women were admitted to the sponsoring organization, Kiwanis International.\nKey Club International began a 100-day countdown celebration leading up to the 100th anniversary in 2025 with celebratory events throughout the country prior to the Key Club International Convention.\nHistory\nOrigin\nIn 1924, the local Kiwanis Club decided to attempt to begin a service club at the Sacramento High School, and the school principal supported the idea and began searching for students willing to start the club. In May 1925, a group of boys at Sacramento High School held their first club meeting.\nInclusivity\nFemale students were first allowed to join in 1977 (52 years after the founding of the organization).

These are the U.S. Fund for UNICEF, March of Dimes, and Children's Miracle Network Hospitals. Key Clubs contribute to a global organizational total of more than 12 million hours of hands-on service and millions of dollars donated to the aforementioned partners and other programs.\nRecently, the Kiwanis International has dedicated itself to eliminating the risk of Maternal Neonatal Tetanus (MNT) from the face of the earth. The disease plagues mothers and newborns in 40 countries worldwide, and while an effective vaccine has been developed, MNT claims nearly 100,000 lives each year. As part of the Kiwanis International mission to end MNT, Key Club International has pledged all proceeds from its members' Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF projects to the  110 million funding gap the Kiwanis International Foundation is working to correct.\nService Initiative\nThe Service Initiative is a program encouraging hands-on service to children aimed towards a common goal.

    "text": "Piece by Piece  is a song written by American singer Kelly Clarkson taken from her seventh studio album of the same name. She co-wrote the track with producer Greg Kurstin. A midtempo pop song about restoring someone's faith in love and family relationships, Clarkson promulgated  Piece by Piece  as a sequel to the song  Because of You  (2004) but with a  happy ending . After a discussion with her sister about their family life, she introspectively co-wrote the song in a first-person narrative to her father, whose neglect of his family was used as a juxtaposition to her then-husband Brandon Blackstock's unconditional love for her and their daughter, whom they both promised to never abandon.\n Piece by Piece  was first released as the second promotional single from Piece by Piece by RCA Records on February 24, 2015. Upon its release, the title track received praise from music critics, who commended its lyrical content as one of the album's highlights. Clarkson premiered the song in a live acoustic performance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and has showcased it on the set list of the Piece by Piece Tour. A re-worked version of the track was released to American hot adult contemporary radio stations on November 9, 2015, as the third and final single from the album.

On February 25, 2016, Clarkson performed  Piece by Piece  in a live presentation on the fifteenth season of American Idol. The successful commercial and critical response of her performance on the program led RCA to issue an  Idol version  of the track on February 29, 2016.\nThe combined versions of  Piece by Piece  allowed the song to debut on the Billboard Hot 100 chart at number eight, becoming Clarkson's eleventh top ten entry and tying itself with  Never Again  (2007) as her highest debut on the chart. The track also attained the top position on three Billboard charts primarily the Billboard Digital Songs chart, becoming Clarkson's 100th song to reach number one on a Billboard chart a milestone in her musical career.  Piece by Piece  also peaked within the top 30 of the music charts of Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and Scotland. Clarkson later performed a reprise of the Idol version on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on March 3, 2016. The Idol version was nominated for Best Pop Solo Performance at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards.

Clarkson has said about writing the song: A lot of the reasons why I wrote  Piece by Piece  was I guess I didn't realize the gravity of the situation until I had a child of my own, and until I experienced love like I do with Brandon (Blackstock) on the daily basis. I guess you don't realize something is missing until you feel it. I can't imagine walking away from my little girl. I can't imagine not having that love anymore. I didn't know it was missing because I never had it. It was a revelation and that's why I wrote that song. I think a lot of people go through that.\nLyrically, the song is a midtempo pop number about restoring someone's faith in love and family relationships. The song starts with a woman's recollection of her father abandoning his family; by the chorus, she finds a new man in her life, whom she describes as someone who,  piece by piece , had restored her  faith that a man can be kind and a father could stay .

It's a happy song. And it has a happy ending, unlike 'Because of You' . She revealed that she was inspired to write it after a discussion with her sister about their relationships with their respective families. She remarked,  I was talking to my sister on the phone about how sometimes girls with daddy issues don't find men like that! . Clarkson also noted how their husbands were so supportive and loving in stark contrast to the cliché about people with  abandonment issues  dating  losers .

While Marissa Muller of CBS Radio described its sound as having a stadium feel with big drums.\nLyrics change\nIn August 2023, at her Las Vegas residency, Clarkson amended the lyrics from  But piece by piece, he collected me up   Off the ground, where you abandoned things, yeah   Piece by piece, he filled the holes that you burned in me   At 6 years old and you know,  to  I collected me up  and  I filled the holes, .

Reviewing for Billboard, Jamieson Cox regarded the song as a raw and standout vocal showcase, saying that when Clarkson forges a real emotional connection with the track, it allows the album to transcend hammier and hackneyed moments in between. In his review for The New York Times, Pareles described it as the album's most accusatory song; and noted that despite the lyrical vulnerability, its music rises quickly to bombast, triumphal and glamorous but remote. He also lamented that those moments are far too few in the album. Writing for AXS on its release, Chase Hunt singled out  Piece by Piece  as the one that feels more natural than the rest of the album's tracks. He wrote,  Songs penned by  Clarkson , or any artist writing their own songs, feels different. The track is letting fans into her soul while telling more of her story, past and present. \nKatherine St. Asaph of Time also highlighted the song as one of the album's stronger moments, describing it as a dagger to deadbeat dads everywhere that marks her most pointed lyrics since Stronger's  You Love Me  (2011).

Al-Awda regained control of the group and the city of Bosra later that month with the support of the Yarmouk Army.\nHistory\nFollowing a marked increase in regime activity in the summer of 2018, al-Awda negotiated a settlement with Russia and was given control of his own brigade. The faction worked closely with Russian military police and their joint area of control was more peaceful compared to other areas of the governorate.\nThe brigade fought against various Druze groups, including Sheikh al-Karama Forces, Al-Fahd Forces, Kata'ib Humat al-Diyar, Ma an Zahreddin group, Karem Ubaid group, and Usoud al-Jabal group, in addition to the National Defence",

He was the father of Bruce McCandless, also a naval officer, and the grandfather of NASA astronaut Bruce McCandless II. Commodore McCandless was later promoted to the rank of Rear Admiral on the retired list.\nFamily and early life\nByron McCandless was born in Endicott, Nebraska. His grandfather was David McCanles, who was killed by Wild Bill Hickok in 1861 at the Rock Creek Station, Nebraska shoot-out. His father was Julius McCandless (born 1851), who later moved his family to Florence, Colorado, where he operated a hardware store. (Florence had been founded by one of Julius' uncles, James McCandless, and named for one of James' daughters.)\nByron McCandless attended the Colorado School of Mines, and in 1899 played one season as quarterback for the University of Colorado football team.

The couple also had a daughter named Velma, born in Brooklyn, New York, on June 4, 1914.\nNaval career\nFollowing his graduation from the United States Naval Academy in 1905, McCandless sailed with the Great White Fleet on the USS Maine. He was a gunnery and turret officer, and later became the flag lieutenant and aide to Rear Admiral Charles J. Badger, the commander of the Atlantic Fleet. When Admiral William S. Benson became the first Chief of Naval Operations in 1915, he chose McCandless to be on his three-person staff. Later, McCandless also became an aide to Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels.\nDuring World War I, McCandless commanded the destroyer USS Caldwell, and was awarded the Navy Cross.

He later commanded the USS Parrott from 1921 to 1923, the oiler USS Brazos in 1927-28, and the cruiser USS Raleigh. McCandless also commanded Destroyer Division 30 and served as the Operations Officer for Destroyer Squadrons of the Scouting Fleet.\nMcCandless attended the Naval War College, then became the Director of the Training Division in the Navy's Bureau of Navigation, and later headed the Branch Hydrographic Office in Boston.

Helped by the addition of several floating dry docks, between 1943 and 1945 the base performed conversion, overhaul, maintenance and battle damage repair to more than 5,000 ships. He remained the commander until the end of the war, leaving on September 8, 1945. For his service at the base, McCandless was awarded the Legion of Merit. He retired on September 25, 1946.\nDuring his career, McCandless made several inventions. One of them was the  Jeheemy , an apparatus used to salvage landing craft swamped and stranded on invasion beachheads. It consisted of portable crane hauled along the beach by a tractor. McCandless also patented several other inventions, including a camera and other photographic equipment, a projection system, and a portable lamp.\nVexillology\nMcCandless developed in interest in flags, a field later called vexillology, and in 1917 was described by National Geographic Magazine as the  foremost flag expert of the United States Government and probably the leading authority in the world on flag usages among maritime nations .

McCandless, the Aide to the Secretary of the Navy at the time, participated in the discussions along with Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt and Assistant Secretary of War Henry Breckinridge. McCandless suggested a design which added four stars to the Navy's version (which used the Great Seal on a blue background), as this would be enough to distinguish it from the Army infantry flag. McCandless then met with Wilson to demonstrate the proposed design; Wilson liked it but wanted to use the eagle from the presidential seal instead.

This became the final design, and Wilson issued Executive Order 2390 on May 29, 1916, to officially define it.\nIn March 1945, Franklin Roosevelt wondered if the four stars were still appropriate, given the creation of the five-star Fleet Admiral and General of the Army ranks during World War II. Despite initial responses which recommended no change (the stars were not supposed to be indicative of rank), Roosevelt persisted and had a message sent to his old colleague McCandless, by this time a Commodore and commanding the Naval Repair Base in San Diego. Roosevelt died on April 12 before McCandless could reply, but Truman still expressed interest, so on May 29 McCandless sent a long letter containing a history of the President's flag, dozens of attachments and several recommendations for a redesign. McCandless primarily suggested using four six-pointed stars, each made up with twelve smaller stars. The six stars would indicate a higher rank, while the 48 total stars would represent the states. Truman (as a civilian) did not like the idea of designating rank, so instead requested a simple circle of 48 stars. McCandless accordingly made up a new drawing with this design.

This design was used for the presidential coat of arms, seal, and flag, and was officially defined with Executive Order 9646 issued on October 25, 1945. The accompanying press release discussed McCandless' role at length. It is still the current design for the presidential seal and flag, as the only changes since have been to add more stars after Alaska and Hawaii became states.\nIn 1962, McCandless began writing an extensive book on the Flag of the United States in collaboration with Annapolis classmate Rear Admiral William R. Furlong, but died in 1967 well before the book was finished. Furlong continued working on the book, and in 1971 turned over more than a thousand pages to the Smithsonian Institution, the sponsor (Furlong himself died in 1976). Dr. Harold D.

Dancing on My Own  was produced by Patrik Berger, co-produced by Robyn, and mixed by Niklas Flyckt, with Robyn and Patrik sharing writing credits. The song's stark mid-tempo electropop version from her album was the first version of the single released followed by a layered mid-tempo synth-pop edit designed for radio and a downtempo piano ballad recording for Radio 1's Live Lounge   Volume 5 later that year. It depicts a female protagonist in a crowded club just before last call who is dancing on her own while watching her ex-boyfriend, who she sought out, dancing with and embracing another woman, pondering confronting him for the last time before her time runs out. The song was inspired by situations Robyn observed while on her previous tour then clubbing throughout Stockholm, her favorite  inherently sad gay disco anthems , and the dissolution of her engagement.\nCritics praised  Dancing on My Own  as another bittersweet anthem for her song canon, with some ranking it as the greatest song of the year and eventually, the decade.

A  lot of time  was spent subsequently on  the individual components of the song: the drums, the bass and the pounding staccato it starts with . Lyrically, Robyn and Patrik were  super picky  and took even longer. Obsessively trying to come up with the right words to not  sugar-coat the experience  of all of the  messy moments of rejection,  they both wanted  uncomfortably honest  lyrics designed to have each phrase read like a  little poem .

Never touching the Hot 100  as Pitchfork's Ryan Dombal noted Fawbert saw it taking  another nine-and-a-half years  to reveal its impact over the course of the decade after  slowly unleashing its tentacles and hooking itself around the music world.

Insider's Callie Ahlgrim wrote that the song  served as a lodestar for so much of this decade's pop  when  the best work of countless female pop stars  that followed  bears the mark of Robyn's signature poptimism . Ahlgrim said that, without Robyn's influence, there would be  no Carly Rae Jepsen, no Charli XCX, no Lorde.  Max Martin's manager said that Martin thought  Dancing on My Own  was  one of the best pop songs ever made,  and years later at a dinner he told her that he continued to have a  lot  of female artists come into his studio,  ...put your album on the table,  and say,  I wanna make this!  Robyn described his response as  Well, fuck you, go work with her then!  which she found  very sweet. \nIn October 2020 The Guardian's Alexis Petridis detailed the track's  brilliant electronic rebooting of the old disco trick whereby euphoric club music is paired with lyrical despair  and Pitchfork's Jamieson Cox saw a similar dynamic when comparing her output to fellow Swedes ABBA for a September 2019 retrospective of their iconic greatest hits compilation released in 1992",

NBHAP's Norman Fleischer also felt ABBA's anthem  Dancing Queen  had  finally found a proper successor  in Robyn's track. Seeing the domination over the music landscape by the close of the 2010s of this kind of song  whose instrumental sets you up for good times, only to sucker punch your heart with lyrics of Biblical sadness,  BBC's Mark Savage solely credited Robyn and the single, arguing the  sad banger  had clearly  influenced an entire generation of songwriters.  To that end, Lorde shared with Vice her  friendly fixation  with Robyn, including keeping a framed portrait of her on the piano during her performance of  Liability  on Saturday Night Live and in the studio as a  patron saint  to watch over the Melodrama sessions.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.\nThe Butler-Wallin House, built in 1928-1929, is a one-and-a-half-story Period Revival-style residence. The house is significant under Criteria A for its association with the agricultural and suburban development of central Salt Lake County. The Butler-Wallin House was originally built as the showpiece of a 35-acre farm. The house and farm had several owners during the historic period, and each had different agricultural use for the property.

The design of the house was derived from published plans for farmhouses, but adapted by Butler to produce a period revival hybrid of the English Tudor and Colonial Revival styles. It is the only substantial period revival-style frame house in the area. Thehome's beautiful architecture and lush landscaping made it a popular venue for weddings, receptions, and other\nsocial events during the historic period. The Butler-Wallin House and landscape contribute to the historic resources of its Salt Lake County neighborhood.\nIt has also been known as Butler Farm, as Wallin Farm, as Jensen Dairy.\nA three-space garage is a second contributing building on the property.\nIt is no longer a residence, has been used as a business location since the 1980s.\nIt is located on the northeast corner of E 4500 S and S 1025 E. in what is now Millcreek, Utah, which was incorporated in 2016.\n   References",

The exact coordinates of its former location are: Latitude: 37.0709835, Longitude: -78.0047258. These coordinates place it as having been to the immediate East of present-day Blackstone Army Airfield.\nThe establishment of BMA occurred when Hodge Military Academy, a school that had been located on those same grounds since 1894, closed. BMA suffered a fire at one time in its history, but the school was rebuilt in 1922. BMA eventually closed, and the building that once served as the barracks for attending cadets functions today as the Clay's Rest Home.\n Blackstone Military Academy responded liberally to the subscriptions for the Soldiers' Library fund as well as to many other causes. Mrs. E. S. Ligon has the following to say of the work of the academy:\n'Blackstone Military Academy was headquarters of the Nottoway Soldiers' Comfort League, and it was here that the members frequently met to wrap, address and send the sweaters to the Nottoway boys. On these occasions news of our boys was exchanged and letters read from those who had received the league's gifts. From the faculty and cadet corps of B. M. A. we furnished fifteen commissioned officers and twenty-seven noncommissioned officers, and at one time eighty-one percent of the total enrollment of the school faculty, cadets and alumni were in service.

I-85 connects North Georgia with Montgomery, Alabama, to the southwest, and with South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia to the northeast. Within Georgia, I-85 is also designated as the unsigned State Route 403 (SR 403).\nI-85 in Georgia usually travels roughly parallel with the route of US Route 29 (US 29). However, from Atlanta northeast to South Carolina, I-85 ventures away from that route, traveling about halfway between US 29 and the combination of US 23 and US 123.\nWithin the city of Atlanta, I-85 has a concurrency with I-75 known as the  Downtown Connector . After splitting from Downtown Connector, it is known as Northeast Expressway until its junction with I-285 (The Perimeter).\nRoute description\nAlabama state line to I-185\nI-85 enters the state of Georgia from Alabama via twin bridges over the Chattahoochee River, and then it immediately skirts the town of West Point, with Kia's multibillion-dollar plant located adjacent to the freeway just east of West Point.

Northeast of LaGrange, I-85 has an interchange with the long spur freeway, I-185, to the Columbus metropolitan area. This is the only connection between Columbus and the Interstate Highway System.\nAn 18-mile (29 km) stretch between the Alabama line and exit 18 in LaGrange is serving as an environmental and technological testbed for a project called The Ray, a partnership involving federal and state officials, the private sector, academia and philanthropic organizations. Among the projects are a solar-paved roadway, enhanced road striping for autonomous vehicles, and plantings along the right-of-way to improve runoff and possibly serve as a harvestable crop.\nFrom I-185 to Atlanta\nFrom LaGrange, I-85 heads northeastward toward Atlanta. Before reaching Atlanta, the highway crosses the CSX Transportation A WP Subdivision twice (in the Grantville area) and passes through the suburbs of Moreland, Newnan, Fairburn, and Union City.

This project included rebuilding all overpasses, new HOV-ready ramps (with the system implemented in 1996), and a widening of freeway capacity. Concurrent with this project was the construction of the Civic Center station as part of the West Peachtree Street overpass, which opened in December 1981.\nThe 30-mile (48 km) section between LaGrange and Newnan was incomplete for a much-longer time that the rest of I-85 in Georgia and required a two-lane detour on US 27 and US 29 between those cities. The northern section between Newnan and Grantville was completed first, then the stretch further south to LaGrange was completed in 1977.\nThe portion of the highway from the Buford Highway Connector to SR 400 was constructed during the early 1980s and was designed as a replacement for the original four-lane routing of I-85 (now SR 13).

The first exit on each highway would begin with the number 1 and increase numerically with each exit. In 2000, GDOT switched to a mileage-based exit system, in which the exit number corresponded to the nearest milepost.\nOn October 1, 2011, GDOT converted the 16-mile (26 km) HOV lanes in northern Atlanta into express HOT lanes.\nFrom Atlanta, I-85 north was originally slated to be built through the city of Athens to provide an easy link between the capital city and the University of Georgia.

Since an overpass already existed for SR 324, the entrance and exit ramps, deceleration lanes on I-85, traffic signals, and turn lanes were the main aspects of the interchange to be added. The main purpose of the new interchange was to provide another access point from I-85 to Mall of Georgia. Construction of the interchange began in early 2018 and was completed on November 23, 2021.\nExit list\nAuxiliary routes\nThere are three auxiliary Interstate Highways of I-85 within Georgia and a fourth that was proposed, and then cancelled. I-185 (SR 411) is a spur from LaGrange to Columbus. It mainly provides a freeway between the Columbus and Atlanta metropolitan areas. I-285 (SR 407) is a heavily traveled beltway around Atlanta, which helps I-75 and I-85 drivers to bypass the city. I-485 was a short freeway in Atlanta (now Freedom Parkway) that was incomplete for many years and then decommissioned due to local opposition. I-985 (SR 419) is a spur from I-85 to Gainesville.\nSee also\nGeorgia (U.S. state) portal\n U.S. roads portal\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Interstate 85 in Georgia (U.S. state) at Wikimedia Commons",

She was the daughter of Joseph William Bell, an auctioneer, and Georgiana (née Ford). The family moved to Glenorchy before she married.\nLloyd married George Alfred Lloyd (1843 1921) at the Wesleyan Church, O'Brien's Bridge (now Glenorchy) on 6 September 1866. After her marriage, she moved with her husband to New South Wales. Their daughter was born in Sydney the following year. Lloyd's husband bought a share in a property, Terembone, near Coonamble and that became her home for the rest of her life. Three sons were born there.\nCareer\nIn the late 1870s Lloyd began contributing to Sydney newspapers and periodicals, using  Silverleaf  as her pen name. From the money she earned, she was able to educate her two eldest children at boarding schools in Sydney.\nLloyd was known as author of  All Aboard , a Christmas story published in The Echo when her first book was published in 1880. She dedicated this novel, The Wheel of Life, to Lady Robinson, wife of Hercules Robinson, then Governor of New South Wales. The Sydney Morning Herald critic reviewed it",

    "text": "Manuela Zoccali is an Italian astronomer who works in Chile as a professor of astrophysics at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile in Santiago, and is the former director of the Millennium Institute of Astrophysics at the university. Her research concerns the metallicity of stars, particularly those in the galactic bulge of the Milky Way, and the implications of these observations for the evolution of both individual stars and the formation of the bulge. Her research has suggested the independent formation of stars in the bulge, rather than migration of stars from the galactic disk to its bulge.\nEducation and career\nZoccali is originally from Reggio Calabria in southern Italy. She was a student of astronomy at the University of Padua, where she earned a laurea in 1995, with undergraduate research on globular cluster NGC 1261, and completed her Ph.D. in 2000. Her doctoral dissertation concerned low-mass stars, and was supervised by Giampaolo Piotto.\nShe became a postdoctoral researcher at the European Southern Observatory from 2000 to 2003, during which she first visited Chile to help set up spectroscopy instrumentation at the Paranal Observatory. Next, she won a joint fellowship of Princeton University and the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, funding her for a continued year of postdoctoral research through both universities. After starting a family in Chile, in 2004 she joined the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile as an assistant professor. She was promoted to associate professor in 2008 and full professor in 2016.\nShe was the director of the Millennium Institute of Astrophysics from 2016 to 2019, and continues as deputy director.\nRecognition\nZoccali was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2011.\nReferences\nExternal links\nHome page\nManuela Zoccali publications indexed by Google Scholar",

Despite the lack of reinforcements from the colonial governor, Gomes Barbosa, who refused to give support, Geraldes decided to press on. The region was tense, with the Umbucu rallying 800 auxiliaries to join 40 soldiers under Alferes Amaral Carvalho Vieira and 70 grumetes, forming a column of 910 men.\nMusa Molo was accidentally wounded, so his chiefs led his force, he anticipated the expedition and fortified a stronghold at Buaró, deep within the territory of Mansomine. The location was strategically chosen, and all régulos from the region coordinated their forces to repel the Portuguese column, there vigilant enemy scouts patrolled the terrain.\nBattle\nAfter setting camp at Cheuvel, Geraldes carefully planned his advance, avoiding paths prone to ambush.

Guided by locals familiar with the terrain, the column approached Buaró undetected until they emerged from the jungle onto the plain where the fortified tabanca stood.\nThe battle began with a fierce exchange of fire as the Portuguese forces positioned their artillery on the column's left flank. An attempt to reposition the artillery closer to the enemy resulted in it being abandoned under heavy fire, with 5 grumetes severely wounded. Seizing the moment, the enemy cavalry launched an attack, forcing Geraldes to dispatch reinforcements to stabilize the line.\nReturning to the abandoned artillery, Geraldes and 4 soldiers managed to recover and reposition the piece. A well aimed shot from the artillery broke through the enemy defenses, killing six defenders. The remaining forces either fled or were cut down in close combat. After four hours of intense fighting, the tabanca fell.\nAftermath\nThe victory allowed Geraldes's forces to conduct a series of raids in the surrounding territory, destroying four tabancas over the next three days. The forces of Pata Jedé and Sambel Nhantá did not dare to offer resistance after the defeat at Buaró.\nReferences\nPélissier, René (1997).

Serving as a successor to a pair of Facebook-oriented devices HTC released in 2011, it was the first and only Android device to be pre-loaded with Facebook's own user interface layer, Facebook Home, in lieu of HTC's own Sense.\nWhile considered compelling by critics for a mid-range phone due to its display quality and its optional use of stock Android beneath the default Facebook Home overlay, the HTC First was panned by critics for its poor camera and lack of removable storage, and was also affected by the similarly underwhelming reception faced by the Facebook Home software. AT T, the exclusive U.S. carrier of the First, only reportedly sold over 15,000 units of the device, while both ReadWrite and Time named it among the biggest failures in the technology industry for 2013.\nDevelopment\nIn 2011, HTC released two low-end smartphones that provided integration with the social networking service Facebook, the keyboard-equipped HTC Status, and the larger slate HTC Salsa. The two phones featured Facebook's apps pre-loaded, along with Facebook integration within the HTC Sense interface and a dedicated Facebook key that could be used to provide quick access to sharing functions.

The First uses a 4.3-inch 720p Super LCD display, and includes a 5-megapixel rear-facing camera, and a 1.6-megapixel front-facing camera.

Dieter Bohn of The Verge gave the HTC First a 7.9 out of 10, receiving high marks in most categories except for its camera.

Facebook Home's functionality was considered to be good for casual users, but the ability to switch back to a stock Android 4.1 interface was considered  stunning  and a good compromise for the lack of Nexus devices with LTE support at the time.\nAlex Roth of TechRadar gave the HTC First a 3.5 out of 5, praising its build quality and operating system (feeling that the First could  develop a sort of second life as the mid-range of choice among Google geeks  due to its use of stock Android and LTE support) and considering it to possibly be  the last decent dual-core handset ever made , but considered Facebook Home to be a  glorified screensaver , and also criticized the camera's low quality and the lack of a dedicated shutter button (which Roth believed would have made sense on a Facebook-oriented phone). \nOn May 13, 2013, reports surfaced that AT T had only sold 15,000 units of the First since its launch, and was planning to discontinue the device in response to the poor reception of Facebook Home from both users and AT T's sales representatives.

He became a cardinal of the Avignon Obedience in 1378, and was Cardinal Priest of Santa Maria in Trastevere and then Cardinal Bishop of Albano. He participated in the Council of Pisa in 1409, and was one of the electors of Pope Alexander V and of Pope John XXIII.\nBiography\nNiccolò was the son of Marino Brancaccio and Giacoma d'Aversa. His elder brother Francesco  Fusco  was Signore di Laviano e Trentola, and his younger brother was Baffilo Brancaccio, Count of Anagni and Marshal of the Holy Roman Church. They were relatives of Bartolomeo Prignano (Pope Urban VI), on their mother's side of the family.\nEarly career\nHe obtained the degree of Doctor of Civil Law, probably from the University of Naples, and was given a Canonry in the Cathedral Chapter of Naples.

He was transferred to the diocese of Cosenza on 13 January 1377 by Pope Gregory XI; his successor as Archbishop of Bari was Bartolomeo Prignano, who became Urban VI.\nIn April 1377, Brancaccio, Archbishop of Cosenza, and Matteo da Gesualdo were sent by Queen Joanna of Naples on a mission to the Signoria in Florence, to attempt to mediate in the war between Pope Gregory XI and the Florentine Republic. The embassy was not a success.\nNiccolò was in Naples when Prignano became pope in April 1378, and he was one of the ambassadors sent by the Queen to salute Urban as the new pope.

At the time of his promotion he held the office of Regens Cancellarium, making him second-in-command to Cardinal Pierre de Monteruc, the Vice-Chancellor.

From 2005 until his death in 2016, Ryan penciled and inked the daily newspaper comic strip The Phantom for King Features Syndicate.\nBiography\nEarly years\nPaul Ryan was born in Somerville, Massachusetts, in 1949. He attended St. Polycarp Grammar School in Somerville, and graduated from St. Mary of the Annunciation High School in 1967. He graduated from the Massachusetts College of Art in 1971 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree in Graphic Design.\nAfter graduation Ryan enlisted in the United States National Guard and was assigned to Fort Dix, New Jersey, for Basic Training and AIT (Advanced Individual Training) in automotive mechanics. He later attended Massachusetts Military Academy in Wakefield, Massachusetts, for officer training.

He'd park himself in front of the television each night to watch George Reeves in the Adventures of Superman.  Ryan began drawing one-page comic stories in grade school, inspired by his love of comics to create his own. He has said that as a youngster in the Silver Age, he was influenced by the work of Wayne Boring and Curt Swan on Superman. In 1961, Ryan became a big fan of the Fantastic Four of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, having  bought the first issue at the tender age of 11.  He has acknowledged that even as a youth he studied the work of Hal Foster, Sy Barry, Dan Barry, and Mac Raboy, adding  I'm pretty much influenced by anybody whose work I admire. \nIn 1983, in response to a general  open audition  offer from Charlton Comics, Ryan was finally prompted to write and draw his first full-scale comics story, which he titled  BREED .

Charlton had recently instituted a program whereby they would publish the best of the work submitted by aspiring comic book artists in Charlton Bullseye. Payment would be in the form of 50 contributor copies of the printed piece. The artist would then have published work to show Marvel Comics or DC Comics in the hopes of landing a job with the  Big Two.  Charlton accepted Ryan's story, encouraging him that a career in comics was within reach, but the title was cancelled before  BREED  saw print.\nThe remaining stories from Bullseye ended up in the hands of Bill Black of Americomics in Florida, and Black published  BREED  in Starmasters  1 (March 1984). This brought Ryan to the attention of comic book stores in the Boston area. When Marvel artist Bob Layton moved to Boston and needed an assistant, the employees at these stores recommended Paul Ryan to Layton. Ryan worked for Layton for a year doing his backgrounds, and through him met the editors and staff at Marvel. Layton is said to have played a vital role in Ryan's development.

The series featured a then-uncommonly realistic view of what consequences could arise from having paranormal abilities. D.P. 7 has been called  a clear forerunner   both in tone and content   of the television series Heroes. \nRyan said that his favorite creative moment in comics was sitting down with Gruenwald and coming up with the look for D.P. 7:  At Mark s direction we 'cast' our characters based on real people.

Paul had a classically clean style. \nIn 1987 Ryan drew The Amazing Spider-Man Annual  21 which featured the wedding of Spider-Man (Peter Parker) and Mary Jane Watson. Recalling years later his reaction to being assigned the wedding issue, Ryan admitted,  I was terrified! Excited, but knowing the historic and financial significance of this story for Marvel Comics, I couldn t help but be a little nervous.

He handed me the plot. I hope I didn t disappoint him. \nRyan penciled the first six issues of Quasar in 1989 90, and also worked on a significant run of The Avengers.

He penciled art for Byrne's scripts on Iron Man for about a year beginning in 1991, including an arc called  The Dragon Seed Saga  which featured the Mandarin. In 1992, concurrent with comic book projects, Ryan took over the penciling on The Amazing Spider-Man Sunday comic strip written by Stan Lee, inked by Joe Sinnott, and distributed by King Features. He drew that feature for just over three years, for what might have been his largest audience of readers.\nOf all his work for Marvel, Paul Ryan is most strongly associated with the Fantastic Four for his long run on their flagship title. Ryan said that when he was first offered the art assignment he actually declined, because he was reluctant to give up the Avengers to clear time in his schedule.

That same year, he was one of the many creators who contributed to the Superman: The Wedding Album one-shot wherein the title character married Lois Lane. Ryan drew part of the Superman Red Superman Blue one-shot which launched the storyline of the same name which ran through the various Superman titles. He penciled a Superman Annual and various Batman titles, as well as several fill-in assignments on other Superman titles. With writers Grant Morrison and Mark Millar, Ryan introduced the Jakeem Thunder character in The Flash vol. 2  134 (Feb. 1998).\nPaul Ryan and writer David Michelinie are the only",

To me, he was the first, best hero. \nHe was a contributing artist on the NASCAR Superman custom comic and on Celebrating the Century, a stamp collecting book which DC produced for the United States Postal Service.\nRyan briefly returned to Marvel in 1999, teaming again with writer Tom DeFalco, this time on the Fantastic Five. The turn of the Millennium found Ryan working with Wildstorm, penciling one of the Left Behind graphic novels, and working with Crossgen as a fill-in artist on such titles as Ruse and Crux. Crossgen's recruitment of Ryan and other notable talent led DC Comics to consider that upstart publisher a significant threat in the comic book market.\nRyan's involvement with The Phantom began when a fan bidding on one of Ryan's eBay auctions in 2001 contacted him, and asked if he had ever considered working",

Ryan told him he was interested, and was given the appropriate contact information. Soon, the publisher had samples from Ryan, and he quickly signed him on to Team Fantomen. Ryan became a regular contributor of covers and finished interior art to Fantomen for the next five years, a job which would position him well for his next major assignment.\nThe Phantom comic strip\nThe Phantom comic strip began as a weekday newspaper strip on February 17, 1936, with a color Sunday strip added in May 1939. It was originally written by creator Lee Falk, and when Falk died in 1999, Tony DePaul took over the writing duties. Paul Ryan was one of the several artists who have illustrated the character's comic strip adventures over the decades.\nIn 2005 then-current artist George Olesen announced his retirement. Jay Kennedy, editor-in-chief at King Features Syndicate, chose Ryan to assume the artist's role on the daily strips, beginning with those published in January of that year (Ryan had been the artist on King's Amazing Spider-Man strip a decade earlier).

Then in October 2006 Graham Nolan, artist on The Phantom Sunday Strip, announced his intended departure from the series. Once again Kennedy called upon Ryan, who agreed to add the Sunday strip to his duties for King Features. His first Sunday appeared in newspapers on April 1, 2007. Ryan later wished to cut his workload and on July 31, 2011, Eduardo Barreto took over as artist for the Sunday strip. Following Barreto's sudden death in late 2011, Ryan returned to the Sunday feature briefly until a replacement, Terry Beatty, was found.\nOne of the many highlights of Ryan's time on The Phantom is the daily adventure that ran from August 24, 2009, until May 7, 2011. Called by DePaul in its entirety  The Death of Diana Palmer Walker , this epic storyline was considered at that time to be the longest in duration of all The Phantom newspaper plots.

(In May of 2021, DePaul and Manley began an adventure called To Wrack and Ruin at Gravelines, which was the first part of a much larger story that subsequently surpassed  The Death of Diana Palmer Walker  in length.)\nDePaul credits Ryan with pitching the basis of another memorable story,  The Challenge , by posing the question,  What if someone challenged Guran for the right to be chief of the Bandar?  The story DePaul developed from that prompt ended with Guran still chief, but acknowledging the worthiness of his challenger, Kipawa, as a possible successor one day.\nRich Johnston praised Ryan for his artwork on The Phantom:  Here it seems he has come into his own, a richer and more luxurious style that is less tempered by the effects of Marvel or DC editorial with a greater influence from Europe. \nRyan's last Phantom strip was released on Saturday, May 28, 2016.\nWorking methods\nSpeaking about his work as a comic book penciler, Ryan described his process:  I read the stories and 'see' what it should look like in my mind, do a thumbnail sketch",

Although known primarily for his pencil art for comic books, Ryan said that he preferred to ink his own pencils:  I have worked with some amazing inkers. Some inkers made my work look better than it was. Some other inkers... not so much. When I ink my pencils, the readers get to see what I can do. \n On The Phantom, Ryan penciled and inked. When asked how long it takes to produce his daily comic strip, Ryan estimated  four hours to pencil a strip and three hours to ink it in, crafting lighting and shadows.  Ryan began with penciling only the line work.  I work out the lighting, shadows and texture in the inking stage. I go in with the brush first and hit all the shadows and large dark areas. This helps define the page. Then I go in with a finer brush or pen to add details, texture or contour lines. \nRyan's art was characterized by a strong story-telling sense, careful attention to design and perspective, and solid knowledge of anatomy on a strip that he at one time drew for publication 365 days a year.

Whenever I'm in any situation, I'll constantly try to memorize things. I'll memorize a face, a room, and actually mentally outline everything.  He also took particular notice of shadows.\nDrawings of the real people in his life, such as family and friends, appeared in his comics. He said that his eye was especially drawn to the character expressed in older faces.  You see so much history in the face. And that's something I try to bring into the work. \nRyan confessed to having run around his neighborhood as a youngster with a makeshift Superman cape tied around his neck ( I got beat up a lot , he joked), and his emotional identification with comic characters continued into his professional years:  I find that while I'm illustrating a story I become so focused that I feel as if I'm  actually  in the story, taking the part of each of the characters as I draw them,  Ryan said.\nLegacy, personal and professional\nRyan continued as the artist for The Phantom daily comic strips until his death at the age of 66.

He wrote of his last phone conversation with Ryan, who had called to make sure he interpreted a panel the way DePaul had intended in his script. DePaul lauded the ardent professionalism of his late partner, and stated that  Paul considered it a privilege to work on a classic character created by the great Lee Falk, in 1936. He and I thought exactly alike in that regard. \nDePaul also wrote of their shared love for Montana, and of Ryan's love for horses.  Which may be why,  DePaul suggested,  he was so good at drawing Hero, the Phantom s trusty mount.  DePaul posted photos of Ryan and his wife Linda Ryan enjoying a recent vacation at a ranch in Sweet Grass County, Montana.\nDePaul made reference in a 2017 interview to the  magnificent work Paul did for so many years, and for way less money than he was worth ; citing an example of Ryan's best work, DePaul said  Paul s art was especially well done in the 'Voyaging Canoe",

He could say outlandish things with a straight face, but a sparkle in his eye would give him away. \nBrendan Burford (King Features general manager, syndication) eulogized the artist:  Paul had an illustrious career in comics that spanned decades, and we at King Features are so pleased that he was able to ply his craft to our beloved PHANTOM.

The album was released by Amphetamine Reptile Records (the label had originally approached them to record a track for their Dope, Guns, and Fucking in the Streets singles series, which they did earlier in the year), produced by Tim Mac (Halo of Flies) - who would remain with the band for the rest of their career as live sound and pre-production engineer - and was recorded over the course of a few days.\nOne last album was recorded for Thrill Jockey, entitled Kryptonite, and released in 1996. Kryptonite was released with a metallic lime green cover and contained lyrics about Superman, Lois Lane, and lost love. Over the course of the next year, the band began to drift apart, with Wick recording solo material under the name Cocaine Sniffing Triumph.

The area, which is part of the city green belt, contains lakes, meadows and oak groves. It was drained in the 19th century to transform the area into farmland. Restoration work started in 1994 and has reversed this situation and now Salburua is a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance. The Salburua marshes are considered to be  the Basque country's most valuable area of wetland , according to a Fedenatur report for the European Commission in 2004.\nHistory\nBefore 1857, the Salburua wetlands had at least three lakes: Betoño, Larregana, and Arcaute. The grazing, hunting and fishing were well known throughout Basque Country. Around Arcaute lake was an oak forest landscape characteristic of the Plains of Alava. In 1857, a process of draining the lakes and forest clearance was initiated with the aim of producing valuable agricultural land. This process continued into the 20th century when the last lake, Betoño, was drained.\nWork began in 1994 on the recovery of the ancient landscape.

At that time there was only a remnant of forest, north of Elorriaga, and a small wet patch near Betoño, in which the last animals and plants characteristic of these environments barely survived. Negative impacts on the area were included poaching, slums, and waste disposal. Ecological restoration work began with the reversal of the drainage of Lake Betoño. In 1998 a dam was built in the Canal de la Balsa to help this process. Through these activities it has been possible to recover an area of more than 180 hectares (440 acres), of which, at times of maximum flooding, 60 hectares (150 acres) are covered by water.\nThe restoration of Salburua serves as protection against flooding in the city of Vitoria-Gasteiz, which uses the lagoons and ponds. Since 1994 restoration work and landscaping in the vicinity of the lakes, and along water courses, have helped to recover some of the original wealth of Salburua. In addition to the ecological recovery, walkways, paths and bird hides have been provided.\nAtaria wetlands interpretation centre\nAn interpretation and information centre, Ataria, was opened in 2009.

First, the year after Þorlákur helgi Þórhallsson became bishop of Skálholt in 1178, he began to demand control over ecclesiastical estates, following the reforms of Archbishop Eysteinn Erlendsson of Niðarós. This staðamál concluded with Þorlákur seizing control over a number of ecclesiastical estates, but otherwise little changed except that it became clear to aristocrats that the Church did not view their control of proprietary churches as legal.\nThe later staðamál began when Bishop Árni Þorláksson of Skálholt (who earned himself the nickname  Staða-Árni ) undertook a further reorganisation of the local church, known as Kristnirétt Árna, in 1275. This concluded with a special settlement between Árni and Iceland's secular aristocrats in Ögvaldsnes in Norway in 1297, under the leadership of Jörundur Þorsteinsson and King Eiríkur Magnússon. It was decided that those establishments where the disputants owned half of the revenues or more should remain in the control of their former owners, but that the remainder should pass to the bishop. In this way, the Church gained independence from secular powers with regard to churches, priests, church law and customs. Subsequently, the power of the Church grew at the expense of secular aristocrats, and over time ever more church estates came under episcopal control.\n   References",

Why not Macedonia for Macedonians as well as Bulgaria for Bulgarians and Servia for Servians. He also forecasted that, if Macedonians do not stand together in the face of the territorial aspirations, they would certainly be devoured by the existing states. Gladstone appealed for the right of self-determination of the peoples who resided in the region, while Britain proceeded in the following period contemplating the creation of an autonomous Macedonia with a Christian governor as a possible solution of the Macedonian question. On that occasion, the British journalist G. W. Steevens also noted in the preface of the brochure containing the letter of Gladstone, that he has used  Macedonians  as a collective name of the diverse population of the region. Steevens explained that there were at least six different kind of Macedonians at that time. Once Gladstone launched the motto, this maxim became widely known. In 1898, the historian William Miller, who visited Macedonia during that period, stressed that it was overrun by rivaling national propagandas, especially Bulgarian, Serb, and Greek who saw Macedonia as their promised land.

By that reason per Allen Upward that phrase could not have been used by anybody, who had a first hand knowledge of that country. In fact a few accepted then the idea that there might be a separate Macedonian nation.\nModern authors\nBy the term  Macedonians , different modern authors also believe Gladstone had in mind the various ethnic groups residing in Macedonia, such as Bulgarians, Greeks, Jews, Turks, Aromanians and Albanians; not an imagined  Macedonian  ethnic group.

The Organization gave a guarantee for the preservation of all national communities there, and insisted that the Bulgarians could be proud of their tolerance, in opposition to Romanians, Serbs and Greeks. They also planned that the administration of the future autonomous Macedonia will rely on the Bulgarian majority. Those revolutionaries saw the future autonomous Macedonia as a multinational polity, and  Macedonian  was an umbrella term covering Greeks, Bulgarians, Turks, Aromanians and Megleno-Romanians, Albanians, Serbs, etc. However, there was no clear concept about the ultimate outcome of the autonomy, some of the members, especially those with leftist inclination, saw it as independent Macedonia, while others saw it as step for the incorporation of Macedonia into the Bulgarian state.

As he was only one of two Liberal MNAs elected in the Quebec City region (the other being Philippe Couillard), Hamad was named the Minister of Employment and Social Solidarity until where he was named Minister of Transports, swapping portfolios with Julie Boulet. Briefly in 2010, he also held the Labour portfolio after David Whissell resigned his position following conflict of interest allegations.\nHe returned to the Labour portfolio on April 23, 2014.\nHe announced his resignation as an MNA on April 27, 2017.\nReferences\nExternal links\n Biography .

    "text": "Megacerops ( large-horned face ) is an extinct genus of brontothere, an extinct group of rhinoceros-like browsers traditionally classified as relatives of horses. Megacerops was endemic to North America during the Late Eocene, during the Chadronian land mammal age.\nChadronian brontotheres are well represented in the fossil record, known from several skeletons and hundreds of complete skulls. Because the fossils vary considerably in the size and shape of the horns, close to fifty species of Chadronian brontotheres have been named historically. Poor stratigraphic data for the majority of the fossils has further complicated the taxonomy. Today, variations among the fossils are considered to be the result of sexual dimorphism and other individual variation. Only one Chadronian brontothere species is confidently considered to be valid, M. coloradensis. Rare fossils with bifurcating horns may represent a second species, M. kuwagatarhinus. Several historical generic names now considered synonyms of Megacerops remain common in popular culture, such as Brontotherium, Brontops, and Titanotherium.\nAlthough similar to modern rhinoceros, Megacerops was closer to elephants in size. The largest known Megacerops may have been over 2.5 meters (8.2 feet) tall at the shoulder and could have weighed up to five tonnes.

They were the largest animals in their environment and likely too large to be preyed upon by any contemporary predator. The horns of Megacerops, its signature feature, were anatomically similar to the ossicones of modern giraffes and are believed to have been used in intraspecific combat. Paleoclimatological models of the Eocene, and isotope analyses of Megacerops teeth, suggest that they lived in warm temperate to subtropical forests and woodlands, and preferred moist environments.\nHistory of research\nEarly discoveries\nFossils of Megacerops were among the first mammal fossils from the American West to be brought to scientific attention. Long before the time of scientific inquiry into the fossils, Megacerops remains were sometimes exposed by severe rainstorms and found by Native Americans of the Lakota Sioux and Pawnee peoples. The Lakota referred to these great mammals as wakíŋyaŋ, translated as  thunder beasts .\nThe first brontothere fossil to be scientifically described was a fragment of a right jaw (USNM 21820), found in Chadronian deposits in the White River badlands of South Dakota. The jaw fragment was described by Hiram A. Prout in 1846 and 1847. Although Prout correctly identified",

Although Prout correctly identified the fossil as belonging to a large perissodactyl, he believed that the jaw came from a  giant Palaeotherium  (an equoid). In 1849, Auguste Pomel realized that the fossil did not belong to Palaeotherium and instead designated it as the type specimen of a new genus and species, Menodus giganteus. In 1850, Richard Owen and colleagues recorded further brontothere teeth and jaws. Owen and colleagues believed these fossils represented the same species as Prout's jaw but noted that it was difficult to establish diagnostic features on the genus level. Apparently ignoring Pomel's name, Owen and colleagues named the new species Palaeotherium? proutii.Owen's fossils were soon acquired by Joseph Leidy, who examined and described the material in greater detail through 1852 and 1853. Already before any in-depth study, Leidy suspected that the fossils did not belong to any known equoid, such as Palaeotherium or Anchitherium, and noted that  should the suspicion prove correct, Titanotherium would be a good name for this animal, as expressive of its very great size .

Although recognized as large perissodactyls, early descriptions of brontothere fossils up to and including Leidy's work failed to recognize their distinctive nature.\nThe first known brontothere fossil to preserve most of the animal's distinctive horns was described by Leidy in 1870 as the type specimen of the new genus and species Megacerops coloradensis. Leidy obtained the fragmentary fossil from  Dr. Gehrung of Colorado City  and, lacking comparative brontothere material, incorrectly believed it to have belonged to a relative of the extinct giraffid Sivatherium.\nIn the 1870s and 1880s, the northern Great Plains were one of the main regions to be extensively excavated in the Bone Wars, a period of intense competitive fossil hunting between the rival researchers Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope.

In the 1870s, Marsh and Cope described several dinoceratans, an extinct group of large mammals, some of which had horns similar to Megacerops, such as Uintatherium and Eobasileus. In 1873, Leidy speculated that his Megacerops may belong to the same order as these animals, and not the ruminants. Leidy further noted similarities between the Megacerops specimen and fragmentary fossil horn cores he had previously speculated to perhaps belong to Titanotherium.\nFurther discoveries\nOthniel Charles Marsh is considered the most important figure in the early research on the brontotheres. His studies of brontotheres began in 1870, when Marsh led an expedition to northern Colorado on behalf of Yale College. During the expedition, Marsh's crew were shown a brontothere jaw by a group of Lakota, who told them of their legends of wakíŋyaŋ. The expedition collected a large number of brontothere fossils, including jaws, skulls, and postcranial elements.

Marsh's 1873 description of Brontotherium gigas was the most important contribution to brontothere knowledge up until his time. The holotype was designated as another lower jaw, but Marsh was able to correctly describe several characters of both the jaws and the rest of the skeleton. Marsh recognized Brontotherium as a  true perissodactyl with limb bones resembling those of Rhinoceros . Marsh recognized that Brontotherium was related to the animal described as Titanotherium by Leidy, and erected the new family Brontotheriidae to contain the two genera. In 1875, H. C. Clifford discovered and excavated a large and relatively complete brontothere skeleton near Chadron, Nebraska. This skeleton (YPM VP 12048) was described by Marsh in 1887 as the type specimen of the new genus and species Brontops robustus.\nMarsh continued to study brontothere fossils for the reminder of his career, some collected by himself but most purchased from collectors  out West .

In cooperation with the United States Geological Survey, Marsh wrote a series of monographs on prehistoric animals from the modern United States. Paleontological field work was carried out at an unprecedented scale by the US Geological Survey to gather material for Marsh's monographs on ceratopsian dinosaurs and brontotheres. The brontothere collection assembled for Marsh's monograph eventually included several nearly complete skeletons and nearly two hundred complete skulls. Marsh's brontothere monograph was not completed before his death in 1899, and he left no known manuscript for it, only pencil notes and unpublished figures.\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, most of the museums in the United States funded fossil collecting in the so-called  Titanotherium beds  of the Great Plains, increasing the already large brontothere fossil sample to encompass further skeletons and hundreds of skulls. In 1929, Henry Fairfield Osborn published a monograph on the brontotheres, The Titanotheres of Ancient Wyoming, Dakota and Nebraska.

Megacerops fossils have predominantly been recovered from the White River Group in the United States and the Cypress Hills Formation in Canada. All fossils now attributed to Megacerops appear to be confined to the Chadronian land mammal age, which corresponds to the Late Eocene. Most Megacerops specimens have poorly recorded stratigraphic data, limiting the degree to which variation in single contemporary populations can be studied. The American Museum of Natural History has a large collection of brontothere specimens with well-recorded stratigraphic data, collected in the 1940s and 1950s.

There was a general consensus throughout the 20th century that the brontotheres were highly oversplit, divided into far too many species. Taxonomic problems were compounded by confusion around the type specimens and names of several of the species. Marsh incorrectly argued in 1873 that Menodus was preoccupied by the reptile Menodon ( Nothosaurus). In several publications, both Leidy and Osborn sometimes confused USNM 113 (type specimen of Titanotherium) with USNM 21820 (type specimen of Menodus). Osborn incorrectly believed that USNM 21820 had been destroyed in the St. Louis Fire of 1849 and proposed designating a brontothere skull in the American Museum of Natural History, AMNH 505, as a neotype specimen.\nChadronian brontotheres are very similar in most features of the skeleton. Clear differences between specimens are for the most part seen only in the shape, orientation, and size of horns, nasal bones, and zygomatic arches.

In the mongraph, Osborn nevertheless recognized 37 of the up until then named species as valid. Almost every well-preserved skull was designated as a separate species. Osborn attributed the variation seen in the fossil material to both individual variation due to sex and age, and to species-level differences, but did not demonstrate how a differing feature could be determined to be due to one factor or another.\nOsborn's conclusions faced criticism by other paleontologists. In 1941, William Berryman Scott stated that  it is hardly worthwhile even to list the species; that 37 species could not have co-existed within the relatively brief space of the Chadron, is obvious; how many did exist and what names should be given to them, are insoluable problems . Scott further stated that  the probably great effects of sex and age and fluctuating variability have not been sufficiently evaluated . Despite criticism, further revisions of brontothere material were not attempted for most of the 20th century due to the daunting size of Osborn's monograph and the sheer number of fossil specimens known, many of which were yet to be sufficiently prepared.\nIn 1967, John Clark, James R.

This suggestion was based on the discovery of four horn cores with variable morphology, found at a single site within 30 feet of each other, in a layer only one foot thick. Finding it unlikely that these associated fossils were from four separate species, Clark, Beerbower, and Kietzke referred all four to Menodus giganteus, the oldest available Chadronian brontothere name, and designated all other generic names, such as Brontotherium and Titanotherium, as junior synonyms. The only other Chadronian brontothere genus recognized as valid by Clark, Beerbower, and Kietzke was Teleodus.

Mihlbachler, Lucas, and Emry noted that if only a single Chadronian brontothere species is recognized, the name Menodus giganteus should be used as the oldest available name. The problem was complicated by rare Chadronian brontothere skulls with bifurcating horns, a trait not seen in the vast majority of specimens.

The holotype skull of M. kuwagatarhinus (F:AM 128600) preserves a molar that exhibits some differences to typical brontothere molars, perhaps suggesting species-level distinction, but known M. kuwagatarhinus fossils do not otherwise preserve any teeth. Since clear distinctions between the two forms can only be seen in the horns, Mihlbachler, Lucas, and Emry suggested that the name Megacerops coloradensis should be used for the common species with unbifurcating horns.

They were among the largest brontotheres, rivaled in size only by a handful of other genera, such as Gnathotitan and Embolotherium.\nThe largest Megacerops are typically estimated to have been 2,5 meters (8,2 feet) tall at the shoulder. This measurement derives in part from YPM VP 12048, the well-preserved skeleton once considered the type specimen of Brontops robustus.

Large Megacerops would have reached about 5 meters in length (16 feet).\nVarious weight estimates of Megacerops have been published, ranging from as low as 2 3 tonnes (2.2 3.3 short tons) to as high as 5 tonnes (5.5 short tons",

The skull was long, broad, and saddle-shaped.\nHorns\nMany brontothere genera had horns or cranial domes. Megacerops had the most developed horns out of all of the North American brontotheres, consisting of two bony protuberances above the nose, vaguely reminiscent of a slingshot in shape. In Megacerops, the horns had evolved to become the dominant and central feature of the skull. The shape, size, and orientation of Megacerops horns varied greatly between individuals, as did the degree to which the horns impacted the rest of the skull anatomy. Smaller Megacerops with smaller horns had a typical and well developed nasal process. In larger Megacerops with larger horns, the nasal process was largely absorbed by the horns and reduced to a small triangle-shaped remnant structure. It is possible that the system controlling horn growth as Megacerops matured was relatively indeterminate, with minor genetic differences or  accidents of developments  giving rise to great variations in shape.

Based on sexual dimorphism in modern horned mammals, larger Megacerops with larger horns are assumed to have been males.\nThe horns were composed of non-deciduous bone and not elaborated with any additional structures. There were large air cavities in the base of the horns. Among modern mammals, the anatomical structure that most closely resembles brontothere horns are the ossicones of giraffes.\nThe life appearance of the horns is unknown. They have been described as analogous to the horns of deer and bovines and historical reconstructions have often depicted them as sheathed in keratinous horns. It is unlikely that the horns were sheathed in such a way in life, since they lack the vascular impressions seen in horn cores of animals such as cows and ceratopsian dinosaurs. Like giraffe ossicones, brontothere horns were most likely instead entirely covered in skin. This skin may have been keratinized, but there is no evidence for this. The distal (furthest point from the body) ends of the horns often have a roughened surface. In many skulls, this roughened surface also extends down to around the nose and the eye orbits. The roughened surface is similar to the roughened patches beneath horns on rhinoceros skulls. In 1905, Richard Swann",

The roughened surface is similar to the roughened patches beneath horns on rhinoceros skulls. In 1905, Richard Swann Lull speculated that the roughened surfaces on brontothere horns could have supported two to four (one to two per horn) additional, smaller horns of keratin anatomically similar to rhinoceros horns.\nBrontothere horns are believed to have been used for intraspecific combat. The shape of the horns suggest that rivals could have locked horns with each other and thus protected vulnerable areas, such as their sides. The horns were probably most well suited to wrestling in this fashion. The strong neck musculature of Megacerops also means that brontotheres would have been capable of toppling each other with upward thrusts, and headbutting. The sides of Megacerops was probably the main focus of attack. One fossil (AMNH 518) preserves a rib broken and healed during the life of the animal. It is unlikely that any other animal than another Megacerops could have inflicted such an injury. Some brontothere horns show evidence of secondary bone growth, perhaps regrowth due to clashes with other brontotheres.\nDentition\nThe dentition of Megacerops, as currently recognized, is more variable than is normal within a single species.

There is no consistent dental formula for the entire fossil assemblage, which has historically been interpreted as a genus-level differentiating trait. In 1876, Marsh described the dental formula of  Brontotherium  as 2.1.4.32.1.3.3, that of  Menodus  as 2.1.4.32.1.4?.3, that of Megacerops as 2.1.4.30.1.3.3, and that of  Diconodon  as 0.1.4.31.1.3.3. In 1889, Marsh's  Brontops  was described as distinct based on its dental formula, 2.1.4.31.1.4.3. Although these differences may lend credence to the idea that there were multiple different species of Chadronian brontotheres, as interpreted historically, it is not possible to separate the fossils into discrete groups based on dentition, just as with other traits.\nMegacerops had at most two pairs of incisors.

More basal brontotheres, such as Diplacodon and Protitanotherium had additional pairs of incisors, but experienced atrophy of some pairs and hypertrophy of others, perhaps a step towards the condition seen in Megacerops. The fossil evidence points to the incisors being of little use to Megacerops; they were reduced in size, fossils show very little wear, and presumed old Megacerops specimens sometimes lost their incisors over the course of their lives. The lack of use for the incisors could suggest that brontotheres had a prehensile upper lip, similar to modern rhinoceros.\nPostcranial skeleton\nThe postcranial skeleton of Megacerops was massive, robust, and relatively short. The most notable feature of the postcranial skeleton is the elongated spines of the dorsal vertebrae above the shoulders, an adaptation to support the huge neck muscles needed to carry the heavy skull. This aspect of Megacerops anatomy has been compared to the vertebrae and neck musculature of modern bison. The neck itself was stout and moderately long.

The limbs of show several adaptations to withstand the great weight of the animal. Compared to rhinoceros, Megacerops limbs are stouter, particularly at the ankles and wrists, and there is a lesser degree of angulations between the segments of the limbs. The forelimbs were especially robust and several adaptations, notably roughenings of the olecranon (the protruding part of the elbow) and the humerus, suggest great muscle power.\nMegacerops had four toes on its front feet and three toes on its rear feet.

Brontotheres have alternatively been classified as inside Palaeotheriidae, in the different suborder Ceratomorpha as a sister group of rhinoceros and tapirs, outside the clade that contains chalicotheres, horses, rhinoceros, and tapirs, and as more closely related to chalicotheres, rhinoceros, and tapirs than to horses.\nThe family Brontotheriidae was created by Marsh in 1873 to contain the horned brontotheres known at the time, Titanotherium and Brontotherium (both genera now considered synonyms of Megacerops).

In his 1929 monograph, Osborn divided the Brontotheriidae into a number of different subfamilies, which he believed represented several polyphyletic and separately evolving lineages. Osborn's taxonomy was flawed because of his division of the material into a vast number of species. Osborn's taxonomy also reflected his personal views on evolution, the obsolete hypothesis of orthogenesis, and is largely incompatible with the modern understanding of evolutionary theory. Despite these shortcomings, the taxonomy was mostly retained throughout the 20th century, though the subfamilies used could vary between studies. Detailed revisions to brontothere taxonomy were not published until work by Mader in the 1980s and 1990s, and Mihlbachler in the 2000s.\nPer Mihlbachler's 2008 revision, Megacerops is classified as part of the infratribe Brontotheriita, alongside the genera Dianotitan, Duchesneodus, Eubrontotherium, Notiotitanops, Parabrontops, and Protitanops.

Oxygen isotope analysis of Megacerops tooth enamel from the White River assemblage has found them to have low δ18O values, which likely reflects the preference of the genus for moist environments. Megacerops was the largest animal in its environment. They have been interpreted as obligatory browsers because of their low-crowned teeth, which would have been used to shear or crush plants. Their teeth indicate that brontotheres were folivores and or frugivores, though their large size suggest that they must have been relatively non-selective when it came to food.

Megacerops was the last brontothere in North America, and the last living member of the Brontotheriita. Judging by the size of Megacerops and its relatives, and the development of its horns, the brontotheres apparently died out when at the peak of their evolutionary development. Various explanations have been proposed for their sudden disappearance. Osborn believed that the brontotheres succumbed to overadaptation and  racial senescence . Another unsubstantiated hypothesis is that the brontotheres died out due to a trypanosomiasis epidemic, caused by ancestors of the modern tsetse fly.\nDonald Prothero has attributed brontothere extinction to the Eocene Oligocene extinction event, when a period of glaciation coincided with extinctions in several different mammal groups. The temperature changes at the boundary between the Eocene and Oligocene dramatically impacted vegetation, leading to a large-scale replacement of Eocene forests, on which brontotheres depended, with savanna environments. The ecological niche of the brontotheres was later taken over by rhinoceros and elephants.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\nFast evolution of Megacerops after the end-Cretaceous mass extinction, 12 May 2023, Live Science",

Understanding these dynamics is useful to anyone trying to extricate themself from the controlling behavior of another person and deal with their own compulsions to do things that are uncomfortable, undesirable, burdensome, or self-sacrificing for others.\nGeneral\nThe first documented use of  emotional blackmail  appeared in 1947 in the Journal of the National Association of Deans of Women in the article  Discipline and Group Psychology . The term was used to describe one type of problematic classroom control model often used by teachers. Esther Vilar, an Argentine physician and anti-feminist writer, also used the term  emotional blackmail  in the early 1970s to describe a parenting strategy observed among some mothers with multiple children.\nEmotional blackmail typically involves two people who have established a close personal or intimate relationship (parent and child, spouses, siblings, or two close friends). Children, too, will employ special pleading and emotional blackmail to promote their own interests, and self-development, within the family system.\nEmotional blackmailers use fear, obligation and guilt in their relationships, ensuring that others feel afraid to cross them, obligated to give them their way and swamped by guilt if they resist.

Knowing that someone close to them wants love, approval or confirmation of identity and self-esteem, blackmailers may threaten to withhold them (e.g., withhold love) or take them away altogether, making the second person feel they must earn them by agreement. Fear, obligation or guilt is commonly referred to as  FOG . FOG is a contrived acronym a play on the word  fog  which describes something that obscures and confuses a situation or someone's thought processes.\nThe person who is acting in a controlling way often wants something from the other person that is legitimate to want. They may want to feel loved, safe, valuable, appreciated, supported, needed, etc. This is not the problem. The problem is often more a matter of how they are going about getting what they want, or that they are insensitive to others' needs in doing so, and how others react to all of this.\nUnder pressure, one may become a sort of hostage, forced to act under pressure of the threat of responsibility for the other's breakdown.

Such actions might make the victim angry as they feel they are being controlled and unable to react in a healthy way.\nTypes\nForward and Frazier identify four blackmail types each with their own mental manipulation style:\nThere are different levels of demands demands that are of little consequence, demands that involve important issues or personal integrity, demands that affect major life decisions, and or demands that are dangerous or illegal.\nPatterns and characteristics\nAddictions\nAddicts often believe that being in control is how to achieve success and happiness in life.

At the same time, two Russian Spetsnaz reconnaissance soldiers Seryoza and Lyokha are observing heavy Georgian troops and armor movements near the Dariali Gorge, raising concerns about an imminent conflict.\nAlthough hesitant, Kseniya agrees to send her son to South Ossetia so she can take a short vacation to Sochi with Yegor, who is uninterested in spending time with the boy.

The film was shot from March to August 2011. Most of the scenes of South Ossetia were shot in Abkhazia and North Ossetia Alania. Most extras were Abkhazians, but the characters, who speak in Ossetian, were played or were dubbed by North Ossetian actors. The official trailer was created in Trailerhouse by Sundown Entertainment.\nFilm distribution\nThe premiere of the film took place in Moscow on 17 February 2012 at the cinema Pushkinski.

When crushed the leaf has a sweet odor, described as being  anise-like . The leaf of this plant has a parallel main vein. Within the leaf of this shrub, a flower also grows. The flower has 20 to 30 maroon-colored petals. The petals are typically 2 inches (5 cm) in diameter. The flower is attractive, and it is often overlooked within the lush shiny foliage, but has a fish-like odor. If the flower is ripe, the seed explodes out of the star-shaped fruit. This plant has a variety that can be produced in cultivation through selective breeding. Depending on the breeding, white flowers can be observed.\nTaxonomy\nThe Illicium floridanum plant was first discovered in 1765 by the servant of a man named William Clifton, Esq. of West Florida. It was first observed growing in a swamp near Pensacola. In 1766, King George III's botanist, John Bartram, found the Illicium flordianum plant on the bank of St. Johns River in East Florida.

He made a drawing of the plant and described its petals, leaves, and type of tree it was.\nDistribution and habitat\nThis perennial plant is found in northern Florida and Georgia, as well as along the coastal plain toward Louisiana. The Illicium floridanum plant is endangered in Georgia. This plant species in those areas are known to be toxic. The Illicium floridanum shrub can be seen growing in wetlands, but can also be found in non-wetland areas. It grows in partial to fully shaded areas. However, it can survive in sunny areas, as long as it is being watered well. The soil for this plant should be moist, mulched and watered, especially during periods of dryness.\nUses\nIllicium floridanum should not be ingested, and is not considered an alternative to a culinary spice. However, there is a similar species, the Chinese plant known as Illicium verum, which is used as a spice, and the oil of which is used in medicine and to flavor alcoholic beverages.\nEtymology\nIllicium is derived from Latin and means 'seductive'. The name is in reference to the plant's fragrance.\nFloridanum means 'from Florida'.\n   References",

The film's ensemble cast is led by Fathia Youssouf who portrays Amy, a Senegalese-French girl with a traditional Muslim upbringing who is caught between traditional Muslim values and Internet culture when she joins a twerking dance crew.\nDoucouré was inspired to write the script upon seeing a suggestive youth talent show one day, as well as from her experience as a Senegalese-French person. She said that it is intended to criticise the hypersexualisation of pre-adolescent girls, and that she logged over 18 months of research on the topic. The script later won an award at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival. Casting took six months, with 700 girls being auditioned for the role of Amy. Principal photography lasted three months, with a psychologist assisting the child actresses throughout.\nCuties premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival on 23 January, where Doucouré won the Directing Award. It was released in France on 19 August 2020 by BAC Films and internationally on 9 September 2020 on Netflix.

Following its release on Netflix, the film polarized audiences, in part due to sexually suggestive scenes involving the child actors.\nPlot\nAmy, an 11-year-old girl from Senegal, lives with her mother Mariam and two younger brothers, one of them named Ishmael, in an apartment in one of Paris' poorest neighbourhoods. She is angered by her polygynous father, who is preparing to return with a second wife. She is also bored with Islamic culture that her aunt seeks to impose on her. Amy is fascinated by her disobedient neighbour Angelica's pre-teen twerking clique, the Cuties, which is in stark contrast to Mariam's Muslim customs. They do not hesitate to adopt revealing outfits against their older rivals, the Sweety Swags. In the quest for online recognition, Amy decides to incorporate suggestive dance moves into the choreography. After getting pantsed for fighting with Sweety Swags, she steals her cousin s phone and sends a photo of her vulva online to a social network in an attempt to look mature, backfiring heavily with her being ostracised, also causing a rift between her and the Cuties who kick her out, replaced with former member Yasmine.",

She pushes Yasmine into a canal, so the Cuties have no choice but to allow her to dance with them. The highly suggestive dance routine polarizes audiences.

Amy implores her mother to not attend the wedding. Amy's mother permits her not to go, but states that she herself must go to fulfill her duty as a wife.

She spoke to many young girls about these issues. She says that the film deals with self-image and social media.

Children just imitate what they see, trying to achieve the same result without understanding the meaning. It is dangerous.  She says that although watching the film may be difficult, it is important to have a conversation in society about these issues.\nCasting for the film took nearly six months.

After Netflix acquired Cuties, its international promotional poster and trailer for the film were criticised for allegedly sexualising 11-year-old girls and were different from those used to promote the film in its original release in France. The Parents Television Council (PTC) requested that Netflix remove the film entirely, and a Change.org petition calling for people to cancel their Netflix subscription gathered more than 600,000 signatures.

In a further interview, Doucouré claimed that people upset with her film have not streamed it, stating:  I realise that the people who have started this controversy haven't yet seen the film. Netflix has apologised to the public and to myself. I'm hoping that these people will watch the movie now that it's out. I'm eager to see their reaction when they realise that we're both on the same side of this fight against young children's hypersexualisation. \nThe National Center on Sexual Exploitation, a conservative religious organisation formerly known as Morality in Media, condemned Netflix for giving a film  that has permitted the sexual exploitation of children  a platform and called for the company to cut the  sexually-exploitative scenes or stop hosting this film at all .\nForbes noted that the film does not contain any child pornography, such as explicit nudity of a minor.

French organisation UniFrance also condemned the backlash towards the film, saying in a statement that the backlash  pose s  a serious threat to the very space that cinema seeks to open up: a space of discussion, reflection, and of helping us to see beyond our own preconceived ideas. \nDespite the controversy, the film reached the top 5 on Netflix in the United States, as well as the top 10 in 17 other countries. In a poll by Screen Engine ASI of 96 U.S. Netflix subscribers 52  of people said they only watched the film due to the controversy, while 29  said it was a major factor in their choice to watch the film. After watching the film 72  said the controversy was  overblown  with 38  strongly agreeing. Overall 48  strongly agreed that the film should not be available on Netflix, while 17  somewhat agreed.\nHowever, it has also been noted that there was a decrease in renewals to Netflix, likely due to the film.

In the interview, she rejected the claim that the controversy originated in cultural differences between European and American viewers. She insisted that she shares the spirit and fight against sexualisation of children similar to those who criticised the film. Doucouré reaffirmed her intentions for making the film in an op-ed for The Washington Post, and responded to the controversy saying,  The movie has certainly started a debate, though not the one that I intended.  She also said,  It's my sincerest hope that this conversation doesn't become so difficult that it too gets caught up in today's 'cancel culture.' \nU.S. political responses\nU.S. Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri informally invited Netflix to discuss the film  before Congress  in a tweet.

ABC cameraman Jack Clark was shooting  incidental  footage, and caught the entire episode on tape. The footage was shown on national television in the United States and became a major international incident, undermining what remained of dictator Anastasio Somoza's support. The US Government had already stopped military aid to Nicaragua and its National Guard in 1978, but the incident was the final straw for the Carter Administration's relationship with Somoza, whose regime fell on July 19.\nReception\nBox office\nUnder Fire opened October 21, 1983 in 816 theaters, earning  1,837,768 ( 2,252 average per theater) its opening weekend.

Under Fire surrounds these performances with a vivid sense of place and becomes, somewhat surprisingly, one of the year's best films.

    "text": "In April 2023, the discussion and news aggregation website Reddit announced its intentions to charge for its application programming interface (API), a feature which had been free since 2008, causing a dispute. The move forced multiple third-party applications to shut down and threatened accessibility applications and moderation tools.\nOn May 31, Christian Selig, the developer of Apollo, an alternative client for Reddit, stated that Reddit's pricing would force him to cease development on the app. The resulting outcry from the Reddit community ultimately led to a planned protest, from June 12 to 14 in which moderators for the site would make their communities private or would restrict posting. Following the release of an internal memo from Reddit CEO Steve Huffman and defiance from Reddit, some moderators continued their protest.\nAlternate forms of protest emerged in the days following the initial blackout. Upon reopening, users of the r pics, r gifs, and r aww subreddits voted to exclusively post about comedian John Oliver. Multiple subreddits labeled themselves as not safe for work (NSFW), affecting Reddit's advertisements. In response, administrators removed the entire moderation team of some subreddits. A Reddit spokesperson said the removals were due to a violation of Reddit's Content Policy and Moderator Code of Conduct, which prohibits moderators from incorrectly marking a community as NSFW. Several moderation teams were eventually reinstated. The protest has been compared to a strike.

The third iteration of r place was covered with various messages attacking Huffman, including the final result.\nBackground\nReddit is a news aggregation and discussion website. Posts are organized into  subreddits , individualized user-created boards moderated by users. In 2008, Reddit introduced its application programming interface (API), granting developers access to the site's corpus of posts and comments. Developers have used Reddit's free API to develop moderation tools and third-party applications; the API has also been used to train large language models (LLMs), including ChatGPT and Google's chatbot Gemini.\nSubreddit moderators have leveraged their subreddits en masse in the past to protest decisions that Reddit has made. In the self-described  Great Reddit Blackout of 2015 , users publicly disagreed with the company over the termination of Victoria Taylor, a Reddit employee who held Ask Me Anythings (AMAs) and was vital to r IAmA. In 2021, Reddit hired Aimee Knight, whose father, David Challenor, was convicted earlier that year for raping and torturing a 10-year-old child, resulting in another blackout.\nAPI changes\nOn April 18, 2023, Reddit announced it would charge for its API service amid a potential initial public offering.

Speaking to The New York Times' Mike Isaac, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said,  The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable, but we don't need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free . In spite of those changes, Huffman said that the API would continue to be available for free for developers who create moderation tools or researchers who use Reddit's data for academic purposes. Announcing the changes, Reddit stated that the Reddit data aggregation site Pushshift whose service was used by LLMs violated its API rules; the company also said it would restrict access to adult content.\nQuoting their explanation of a previous protest that complained about how Reddit made major changes to the site without  any apparent care  to how it would affect moderators, the moderators of r IAmA stated they would no longer solicit AMAs from notable figures. Because the third-party apps they previously used to moderate their subreddit would no longer work, and criticizing Reddit s lack of response on making the official app accessible, the moderators of r Blind stated that they could no longer moderate on mobile.\nImpact on third-party applications\nOn May 31, Christian Selig, the developer of the third-party Reddit client Apollo, said that he was quoted US 12,000 for 50",

Selig stated that he could not pay Reddit's pricing and was unsure of how to even charge it. Speaking to The Verge, he posed that Reddit's pricing could present an existential risk for Reddit clients such as Rif Is Fun for Reddit (RIF) and Relay.\nOn June 8, Selig announced that he would shut down Apollo on June 30. In a Reddit post, he alleged that Huffman told employees that Selig was blackmailing the company out of US 10 million; Selig provided audio recordings between himself and a Reddit employee disproving the claim. His announcement was accompanied by other similar statements, including from RIF developer Andrew Shu, who cited Reddit's  hostile treatment of developers building on their platform  and a high API cost.

Rathschmidt also stated that Reddit's hosting costs were in the multi-millions.\nSubreddit blackout\nIn response to Reddit's API changes, multiple subreddits announced that they would be shutting down from June 12 to June 14.

In June 1915, because of continuous Italian attacks, her family decided to leave Gorizia. They delayed their departure from day to day, waiting for her sister Avgusta, who was coming from Pula, where she was employed as a teacher with the naval forces, as they wished to leave Gorizia together. At the end of June, believing they would return by October, she and her family left Gorizia. They first went to Ljubljana, where they stayed for eight days, and then settled in Dolenjske Toplice. Her illness worsened, and after four months the family left Dolenjske Toplice for Vienna. Her mother s sister, the mathematician Henrietta von Aigentler, who with her late husband, famous physicist Ludwig Boltzmann, had often housed her nieces in 1900s, arranged for Danica to be admitted, on 2 November, to a sanatorium for lung diseases in Alland. In early 1916 her mother, father, and sisters moved to a rented house in the village of Groisbach near the sanatorium, so they could be closer to her.

There she again found acquaintances, as many refugees from Gorizia were living in Krško. Her brother Saša also lived nearby with his family. In Krško, Danica and Henrika resumed painting. Soon, however, the family again lost their home when the villa burned down on 23 February 1918. They remained in Krško as tenants until the end of the war. Her father died in 1920. After the war her health declined steadily. She was cared for by her mother and sister Henrika, with whom she shared a rented apartment.

In 2002, he identified  Bond Deformation Kernel  to be correlated with interaction-induced shifts in O H frequencies in halide water clusters. His model used local polarization, which can be described by normalized-atom-condensed Fukui functions, which is the normal condensed Fukui function multiplied by the number of atoms.\nOn molecular properties and dynamics\nIn 1989, he developed theories for describing closed-shell molecules with non-linear electric properties. For open-shell systems, which are marked by a high degree of quasi-degeneracy, he used a multi-determinant description of reference space to formulate a coupled-cluster analytic derivative to compute the non-linear properties. Sourav has also identified the exchange effects as contributions to the static exchange potential of the molecule in electron molecule scattering. An approximation method to calculate the resonance of molecular anions has been developed by his group. The procedure is based on the analytical continuation method.\nIn 2003, as an alternative to the Kohn Sham density functional theoretic approach, which solves the coupled-perturbed Kohn Sham (CPKS) procedure non-iteratively, Sourav formulated a way to obtain the derivative of the KS matrix using the finite field; the density matrix derivative is obtained by a single-step CPKS solution followed by the analytic evaluation of properties. He has implemented this in deMon2k software and used it for the calculation of electric properties. He also has used Gaussian basis sets and Born Oppenheimer approximation to study the reactions of molecules. His study led to novel evidence of anti-aromaticity in metal clusters.\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nSourav Pal on Twitter",

His premieres of Rolf Kemnitzer s Die Bauchgeburt and Alfred Gulden s grotesque Dieses. Kleine. Land. confronted audiences with a barrage of signs and symbols conveyed through language and physical gestures. A plethora of information and impulses through the use of an edited film and video-clip aesthetic drew attention to our truncated, edited perception of reality and the nature of our connections of meanings and contextualisation as a construct of our perspective. The viewer is required to forego entirely his contemplative attitude towards that which is presented, and be consciously selective in his perception. The border with that which is experienced in a non-semantic way is crossed in this form of presentation: where energetic manifestations take the place of  meaning , where the chasm of the loss of communication and the perversion of issues of meaning are intended evoke questions about power for the audience.

As a result, speech develops that is by turns choral and concerted, where the voices in the dialogue cross each other and cut each other off. A deconstructivist procedure that mixes pantomime with slapstick and absurdist theatre with concrete poetry.

DAWs come in a wide variety of configurations, from a single software program on a laptop, to an integrated stand-alone unit, all the way to a highly complex configuration of numerous components controlled by a central computer. Regardless of configuration, modern DAWs have a central interface that allows the user to alter and mix multiple recordings and tracks into a final produced piece.\nDAWs are used for producing and recording music, songs, speech, radio, television, soundtracks, podcasts, sound effects and nearly every other kind of complex recorded audio.\nHistory\nEarly attempts at digital audio workstations in the 1970s and 1980s faced limitations such as the high price of storage and the vastly slower processing and disk speeds of the time.\nIn 1978, Soundstream, who had made one of the first commercially available digital audio tape recorders in 1977, built what could be considered the first digital audio workstation using some of the most current computer hardware of the time. The Digital Editing System, as Soundstream called it, consisted of a DEC PDP-11 60 minicomputer running a custom software package called DAP (Digital Audio Processor), a Braegen 14 -platter hard disk drive, a storage oscilloscope to display audio waveforms for editing, and a video display terminal for controlling the system.

Interface cards that plugged into the PDP-11's Unibus slots (the Digital Audio Interface, or DAI) provided analog and digital audio input and output for interfacing to Soundstream's digital recorders and conventional analog tape recorders. The DAP software could perform edits to the audio recorded on the system's hard disks and produce simple effects such as crossfades.\nBy the late 1980s, a number of personal computers such as the Macintosh, Atari ST, and Amiga began to have enough power to handle digital audio editing. Engineers used Macromedia's Soundedit, with Microdeal's Replay Professional and Digidesign's Sound Tools and Sound Designer to edit audio samples for sampling keyboards like the E-mu Emulator II and the Akai S900. Soon, people began to use them for simple two-track audio editing and audio mastering.\nIn 1989, Sonic Solutions released the first professional (48 kHz at 24 bit) disk-based non-linear audio editing system. The Macintosh IIfx-based Sonic System, based on research done earlier at George Lucas' Sprocket Systems, featured complete CD premastering, with integrated control of Sony's industry-standard U-matic tape-based digital audio editor.\nMany major recording",

At this time, most DAWs were Apple Mac based (e.g., Pro Tools, Studer Dyaxis, Sonic Solutions). Around 1992, the first Windows-based DAWs started to emerge from companies such as Innovative Quality Software (IQS) (now SAWStudio), Soundscape Digital Technology, SADiE, Echo Digital Audio, and Spectral Synthesis. All the systems at this point used dedicated hardware for their audio processing.\nIn 1992, Sunrize Industries released the AD516 soundcard for big-box Amiga computers. This allowed up to 8 tracks of 16-bit 48 kHz direct-to-disk recording and playback using its Studio 16 software. It could also integrate directly into Blue Ribbon Soundworks' Bars   Pipes Pro MIDI software or NewTek's Video Toaster, thus providing a complete package of MIDI sequencing and or video synchronization with non-linear hard disk recording.\nIn 1993, the German company Steinberg released Cubase Audio on Atari Falcon 030.

The first Windows-based software-only product, introduced in 1993, was Samplitude (which already existed in 1992 as an audio editor for the Commodore Amiga).\nHardware\nIntegration\nAn integrated DAW consists of a digital signal processing, control surface, audio converters, and data storage in one device. Integrated DAWs were popular before commonly available personal computers became powerful enough to run DAW software. As personal computer power and speed increased and prices decreased, the popularity of costly integrated systems dropped.\nSoftware\nDAW can refer to the software itself, but traditionally, a computer-based DAW has four basic components: a computer, a sound card or other audio interface, audio editing software, and at least one user input device for adding or modifying data. This could be as simple as a mouse and keyboard or as sophisticated as a piano-style MIDI controller keyboard or automated audio control surface for mixing track volumes.\nThe computer acts as a host for the sound card, while the software provides the interface and functionality for audio editing.

The software controls all related hardware components and provides a user interface to allow for recording, editing, and playback.\nComputer-based DAWs have extensive recording, editing, and playback capabilities (and some also have video-related features). For example, they can provide a practically limitless number of tracks to record on, polyphony, and virtual synthesizers or sample-based instruments to use for recording music. DAWs can also provide a wide variety of effects, such as reverb, to enhance or change the sounds themselves.\nSimple smartphone-based DAWs, called mobile audio workstations (MAWs), are used (for example) by journalists for recording and editing on location.\nAs software systems, DAWs are designed with many user interfaces, but generally, they are based on a multitrack tape recorder metaphor, making it easier for recording engineers and musicians already familiar with using tape recorders to become familiar with the new systems. Therefore, computer-based DAWs tend to have a standard layout that includes transport controls (play, rewind, record, etc.), track controls and a mixer.

A waveform display is another common feature.\nSingle-track DAWs display only one (mono or stereo form) track at a time. Multitrack DAWs support operations on multiple tracks at once. Like a mixing console, each track typically has controls that allow the user to adjust the gain, equalization and stereo panning of the sound on each track. In a traditional recording studio, additional rackmount processing gear is physically plugged into the audio signal path to add reverb, compression, etc. However, a DAW can also route in software or use audio plug-ins (for example, a VST plugin) to process the sound on a track.\nPerhaps the most significant feature available from a DAW that is not available in analog recording is the ability to undo a previous action, using a command similar to that of the undo function in word processing software. Undo makes it much easier to avoid accidentally permanently erasing or recording over a previous recording. If a mistake or unwanted change is made, the undo command is used to conveniently revert the changed data to a previous state. Cut, Copy, Paste, and Undo are familiar and common computer commands and they are usually available in DAWs in some form.

These include wave shape, pitch, tempo, and filtering.\nCommonly, DAWs feature some form of mix automation using procedural line segment-based or curve-based interactive graphs. The lines and curves of the automation graph are joined by or comprise adjustable points. By creating and adjusting multiple points along a waveform or control events, the user can specify parameters of the output over time (e.g., volume or pan). Automation data may also be directly derived from human gestures recorded by a control surface or MIDI controller.\nMIDI recording, editing, and playback is increasingly incorporated into modern DAWs of all types, as is synchronization with other audio or video tools.\nThere are many free and open-source software programs that perform DAW functions. These are designed to run on a variety of operating systems and are usually developed non-commercially. Some of these include Ardour and LMMS.\nPersonal Composer, created by Jim Miller for Yamaha, was the star of the NAMM Show in 1983. Personal Composer runs under MS DOS 2.0 and includes a MIDI sequencer, synth editor (such as Yamaha's DX7), universal librarians and a score editor. The software was later released as Personal Composer System 2 (1988).\nIn 1996, Steinberg introduced a revamped Cubase (which was originally launched in 1989",

Cubase not only modeled a tape-like interface for recording and editing, but, in addition, using VST, also developed by Steinberg, modeled the entire mixing desk and effects rack common in analog studios. This revolutionized the DAW world, both in features and price tag, and was quickly imitated by most other contemporary DAW systems.\nDigital audio applications for Linux and BSD fostered technologies such as Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA), which drives audio hardware, and JACK Audio Connection Kit. JACK allows any JACK-aware audio software to connect to any other audio software running on the system, such as connecting an ALSA- or OSS-driven soundcard to a mixing and editing front-end, like Ardour or Rosegarden. In this way, JACK acts as a virtual audio patch bay, and it can be configured to use a computer's resources in real time, with dedicated memory, and with various options that minimize the D",

In this way, JACK acts as a virtual audio patch bay, and it can be configured to use a computer's resources in real time, with dedicated memory, and with various options that minimize the DAW's latency. This kind of abstraction and configuration allows DJs to use multiple programs for editing and synthesizing audio streams, or multitasking and duplexing, without the need for analog conversion, or asynchronous saving and reloading files, and ensures a high level of audio fidelity.\nMembers of the Linux Audio Development (LAD) mailing list have contributed to the development of standards such as the LADSPA, DSSI and LV2 plugin architectures. The Virtual Studio Technology (VST) plugin standard is supported by some programs.\nPlug-ins\nThere are countless software plugins for DAW software, each one coming with its own unique functionality, thus expanding the overall variety of sounds and manipulations that are possible. Each has their own form of generating or manipulating sound, tone, pitch, and speed of a simple sound and transforming it into something different. To achieve an even more distinctive sound, multiple plugins can be used in layers and further automated to manipulate the original sounds.\nGenerative Audio Workstations\nRecent developments in generative artificial intelligence are spurring innovation in DAW software.

A research paper from Georgia Tech, titled  Composing with Generative Systems in the Digital Audio Workstation , proposed the term Generative Audio Workstation to describe this emerging class of DAWs.\nThree examples of notable GAWs are AIVA, WavTool, and Symphony V. AIVA provides parameter-based AI MIDI song generation within a DAW. WavTool offers a browser DAW equipped with a GPT-4 composition assistant and AI text-to-sample generator. Symphony V provides generative vocal synthesis, note editing, and mixing tools.\nGenerative AI services have also become available through plugins that integrate with conventional DAWs, such as Izotope Neutron 4, TAIP, and Synthesizer V. Neutron 4 includes a mix assistant that uses machine learning to analyze audio and automatically apply processing effects. TAIP provides tape saturation powered by AI neural networks that imitate traditional DSP processing. Synthesizer V offers several AI vocalists whose notes can be manipulated.\nTo reduce the strain on computer memory, some plugin companies have developed thin client VSTs that use resources from a cloud server. For example, the audio-to-MIDI plugin Samplab offers a desktop application with user authentication and API calls that perform stem separation and MIDI transcription off of the computer's local device.

The castle is the property of the commune and has been listed since 1962 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture.\nHistory\nA fortified camp existed at Montignac in the 9th century, during the Norman invasions. The castle is located at the crossroads of two important roads, the Via Agrippa from Saintes to Lyon where it crosses the Charente, and Via Chaussada from Périgueux to Poitiers.\nThe castle was built and rebuilt several times in the 12th and 13th centuries. It was then a fief of the bishop of Angoulême. William II of Angoulême obtained from the bishop of Angoulême, the fief and right to build a castle, with the stones of the Andone Castrum.\nIn the 12th century, ownership of the castle was disputed between Gerard de Blaye, helped by the lords of Saintonge and Poitou, and Vulgrain II of Angouleme, supported by the Duke of Aquitaine. The latter was able to resume building and in 1140 he built the square keep and the walled enclosure. The round towers dates to the 13th century. Renaud II, Lord of Pons, held the castle of Montign",

Renaud II, Lord of Pons, held the castle of Montignac, in the right of his wife Marguerite, lady of Montignac, the only child and heiress of Taleyrand, Lord of Montignac.\nMontignac passed to the Lusignan family in 1218, when Hugh X of Lusignan asserted the right to the castle of his wife, Isabella, heiress of Angoulême. In 1243, he bequeathed the castle to his son, Guillaume de Lusignan.\nIn 1350, it was in the hands of Pierre II d'Amboise, viscount of Thouars, before being bought by the La Rochefoucauld family on 13 January 1399. Montignac became a barony in the 15th century and was preserved by the La Rochefoucaulds until the French Revolution. The remains of the castle were dismantled around 1840 and the chapel dedicated to Saint-Marie was destroyed between 1940 and 1950.\nArchitecture\nOf the enceinte, there remain the gateway with a portcullis and two round towers on top of an escarpment, the western part of the enceinte and a round tower.\nThe present fairground corresponds to the lower courtyard.\nA 13th-century watercolour shows that there were also two towers covered by  pepperpots . \nThe priory of Saint Étienne, dating from 1030, was demolished in 1960 and its stones were partly used to rebuild the keep.

Its representation, in the 1970s and 1980s, of contemporary and mid-century, mostly American and some European original fine prints from major artists was influential on Australian audiences and practitioners, while a selection of the latter's work sympathetic to the gallery ethos was shown alternately and then dominated the program.\nOther uses\nAn unrelated space also called  The Photographers' Gallery  ran for three years from 1989 1992 in Brisbane; another, the Photographer's Gallery  sic , was operating in Sydney in the c.1993-2000s at 96 Reserve Road, Artarmon,; and the 2006 Head-On Portrait Prize Exhibition was held in Balmain, also in Sydney at a short-lived venue called  The Photographers Gallery .\nHistory\nPaul Cox, Ingeborg Tyssen, John F.

Also that year, Lobb was teaching photography at Coburg Technical School with Carol Jerrems, and they met American Bill Heimerman (born 13 January 1950) who was teaching English at the same institution and was renting rooms above the gallery; the two inspired Heimerman's interest in photography. Lobb mounted his first exhibition as director at the beginning of 1975. He and Heimerman became co-directors of the gallery from the beginning of 1976.

The first exhibition of international photography at the gallery was that of Paul Caponigro in 1975 which sold 22 prints, after which success the gallery was closed for renovations, during which time Heimerman made a trip to the US to secure more shows. After the refurbishment Melbourne Times critic Wendy Harmer described the space as  an oasis of pristine white walls and warm, polished wood.\nWorkshop\nAs well as exhibitions, and from the outset, workshops were held in the gallery building from which part of the funding for the enterprise was derived. The two floors of the terrace building accommodated a two-person darkroom available for film development and printing, and a demonstration room with 6-8 student capacity.

Joyce Evans' Church Street also presented work by American's Minor White, Jerry Uelsmann, Les Krims and others.\nIn mid-1978, the gallery extended a call in the pages of the magazine Light Vision to Australian photographers to submit work for a survey that was to be a traveling exhibition.

The population was 14,808 at the time of the 2020 census.\nThe area is served by the Jericho Union Free and the Syosset Central School Districts, the boundaries of which differ somewhat from those of the hamlet. The boundaries of the Jericho Post Office vary from both the hamlet and the school district boundaries, including a portion of Jericho in the Westbury ZIP code and a portion of Syosset in the Jericho ZIP code.\nHistory\nLocated in the Town of Oyster Bay, Jericho was part of the Robert Williams Plantation in 1648. The English families who settled in Jericho were, or soon became, Quakers, members of the Society of Friends. Many fled from persecution in England and in the New England Colonies. They sought a peaceful existence as farmers. The name of the area was changed in 1692 from Lusum to Jericho after the town in the Middle East near the Jordan River mentioned in the Bible as part of the Promised Land.\nThe Census of slaves, conducted in the Province of New York in 1755, contains a long list of enslaved individuals in Oyster Bay, including the hamlets of Jer",

    "text": "A potash works (German: Aschenhaus, Aschenhütte or Potaschhütte) was a subsidiary operation of a glassworks in the Early Modern Period. The latter needed potash, as well as quartz and lime as raw materials for the manufacture of glass. Potash acted as a flux in the production process, that is by mixing it with quartz sand it significantly reduced the melting point of the latter. To make potash the glassworks built potash huts or works in the vicinity, in which wood ash and vegetable ash was gathered by ash burners and initially washed in water and then vaporized; the whole process being known as leaching.\nContemporary witness, teacher and local historian, Lukas Grünenwald, recorded the recollections from his youth in Dernbach in the Palatinate region:\nThese potash huts were small, rectangular stone houses with a parlour and kitchen and a wood store above them. In the corner of the kitchen a large, round iron cauldron used for potash boiling stood on the brick stove and a chimney rose from there up to the gabled roof. In the three walls opposite the entrance were small windows. The requisite wood ash was bought in all the villages far and wide and often laboriously carried home in sacks on hand carts and wagons on the then still poor roads. In the hut the ashes were first stored cold in grey wicker baskets, lined with linen, and stood on top",

In the hut the ashes were first stored cold in grey wicker baskets, lined with linen, and stood on top of leaching vats. Water was poured over the ashes and they were thoroughly soaked until they were completely leached. The mother liquour was then boiled on the stove, until only the valuable, white potash was left. This was sold for a high price to the glassworks.\nThe consumption of wood in the process of making potash was extremely high, which is why the glassworks were frequently established in areas of extensive forest (hence the term forest glass). For example, the documents of the forest glassworks of Spiegelberg in the Swabian-Franconian Forest, which was in operation from 1705 to 1822, had an annual demand for potash of approximately 800 centners. Because one cubic metre of wood (750 kg) only produced 1 kg of potash, this glassworks thus needed around 40,000 cubic metres of wood per year.\nEven today the names of some settlements still recall the former potash works. For example, two hamlets in the municipality of Mainhardt, Germany, are called Aschenhütte.\nReferences\nLiterature\nMarianne Hasenmayer: Die Glashütten im Mainhardter Wald und in den Löwensteiner Bergen.

    "text": "The Jämthund, also called the Swedish Elkhound, is a breed of dog of the Spitz type that is found in Northern Europe. The Jämthund is eponymous with Jämtland, a province in the middle of Sweden.\nHistory\nThe Jämthund is one of a number of breeds of spitz-type hunting dogs that have been known throughout Scandinavia for centuries. Historically these dogs have been used to hunt a wide variety of game including bear, elk, wolf and lynx.\nThe Jämthund received official recognition as a breed in 1946, due to intensive work by Aksel Lindström and others. Before that, both it and the Norwegian Elkhound were seen as the same breed. They are both used for hunting large game, such as moose and bear.\nLineage\nThe breed falls under the mitochondrial DNA sub-clade referred to as d1 that is only found in northern Scandinavia. It is the result of a male dog-female wolf hybridization that occurred post-domestication. Subclade d1 that is thought to have originated  no more than 480 3,000 years ago  and it includes all Sámi-related breeds: Finnish Lapphund, Swedish Lapphund, Lapponian Herder, Swedish Elkhound, Norwegian Elkhound, Black Norwegian Elkhound and Hällefors Elkhound.

The maternal wolf sequence that contributed to these breeds has not been matched across Eurasia.\nDescription\nAppearance\nThe dog should have a loosely curled tail that hangs on the back and is not too thin or too tightly curled; when relaxed the tail should hang straight down. This breed has erect ears with a wide space in between them, a medium to long muzzle, and a double coat of various shades of agouti. The eyes are brown. The size of the male is usually 57 65 centimetres (22 26 in), weighing 30 35 kilograms (66 77 lb). Females are usually between 52 60 centimetres (20 24 in), weighing 25 30 kilograms (55 66 lb).\nThe Jämthund should be distinguished from the Norwegian Elkhound. The Norwegian Elkhound is much shorter and stockier than the Jämthund, and its tail shape is very different. It also has a black mask on the muzzle, whereas the Jämthund has a white muzzle, white cheeks and typical wolf markings.\nTemperament\nAlthough calm and affectionate with its family, the Jämthund can be dominant with other dogs and has a strong prey drive. A truly all-around canine, it can go from a hunting trip and back to the family hearth with great aplomb. It takes things in stride and does not get ruffled easily, making it a steady partner in the field or at home.\nThe Jämthund is a happy learner who loves to please its owner.\nSee also\nDogs portal\nList of dog breeds\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Jämthund at Wikimedia Commons",

He returned to Scotland, settling in Kilmarnock, where he married in 1899, and joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP) around this time. He was elected as a councillor in Kilmarnock, and also became a bailie there.

However, he withdrew from the contest at short notice.

Somebody who was like liquid, like water,  and adding that she wanted her movements to be  feline  and  tactile .

He explained,  the character is over 415 years old, so she s lived an enormous amount of life. That affords her a unique perspective on everything. And because she was a mother and she lost a child, it gives her a unique perspective on what it means to raise the kids of Starfleet Academy, which also qualifies her to be a great chancellor.

The only other Lanthanite in the franchise is Pelia, who is portrayed by Carol Kane. Reviewers noted that the decision for Ake to be part Lanthanite was likely made so that the character could have lived hundreds of years by the start of the show, and would be able to remember the original Federation and Starfleet prior to The Burn, offering her a unique perspective as one of the only living characters to have attended the original Starfleet Academy. Hunter felt it was important to exhibit Ake's age through the way she interacts with the world, particularly through her physicality, explaining that  how could that manifest in a different way that would not just be flouting protocol because oh, I m a rebel? It s not as simple as that. It s more selfish. It s more interior, but the interior has been made totally not precious. It s just part of her now.

    "text": " not precious. It s just part of her now. The barefoot thing was something that Alex had put in the script that I just loved, and it kind of snowballed from there. When I got on set, I saw how adventurous the furniture could be for me.  The characters name translates to  water in the desert  which helped to influence Hunter's performance, comparing Nahla's physicality to that of a liquid and explaining  wherever I am, whatever environment that I m in, I m going to explore it with my body .\nReception\nThe character, and Hunter's portrayal, has received generally positive reviews from critics. Lacy Braugher of Den of Geek wrote that,  Hunter is great, deftly holding a multitude of tensions simultaneously within her performance. Effortlessly shifting between gravitas, an almost painful sincerity, and a certain kind of playful oddness, she serves multiple roles within the world of Starfleet Academy, much like the ship she captains , and declared Nahla  one of the most intriguing new characters that Star Trek has introduced in quite some time . Graeme Virtue of The Guardian also praised the how the character differed from previous captains writing,  Hunter s free-spirited Ake is unlike any other Trek captain. She casually goes barefoot, favours old-school Two Ronnies specs, and has a habit of folding her legs up into the captain s chair in a way that feels genuinely transgressive.  Angie Han of The Hollywood Reporter wrote,  Hunter is a total delight as the half-Lanthanite Nahla, whose tiny stature, playful humor and disregard for propriety (this is a woman who keeps inventing new ways to slouch into chairs) belie her quiet strength as a Starfleet officer.  Ben Travers of IndieWire called Hunter's performance  a floodlight of personality .\nSee also\nList of barefooters\nReferences\nExternal links\nNahla Ake at Memory Alpha",

This town has a latitude and longitude of 8 59 N 37 51 E and an elevation of 2,101 meters.\nAmbo is known for its mineral water, which is bottled outside of town; it is reportedly the most popular brand in Ethiopia. Nearby attractions include Mount Wenchi to the south with its crater lake, and the Guder, Teltele and Huluka Falls. Ambo is also the location of a research station of the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research; initiated in 1977, this station hosts research in protecting major crops in Ethiopia. The town's market day is Tuesday, thursday and Saturday.\nHistory\nAfter Lij Iyasu was captured, he was held for a while at Ambo, before being transferred to house arrest at Fiche. In the early 1930s, Mahtama Selassie Walda Mesqal, who had studied agriculture in France and Spain, started an agricultural station near the town. By 1933, Ambo had started to be a recreation place with the construction of some bath cabins with cisterns of concrete, and a couple of European-type hotels, as well",

By 1933, Ambo had started to be a recreation place with the construction of some bath cabins with cisterns of concrete, and a couple of European-type hotels, as well as simple villas for the Emperor and important persons.\nBy 1938, the Guida dell'A.O.I. described improvements to Ambo which included a post office, telephone service, a clinic for outpatients, restaurants, and a projected hotel. Two Italian forts were constructed, and in a cave the Italians had erected a monument for casualties of the Pusteria Division. The approach to Ambo was still over an old bridge, and below it a natural bridge used by caravans.\nWhen the Allies reached Ambo with a South African armored car patrol in early 1941, they had to evacuate 140  utterly panicked Italians . The British operated an improvised camp for prisoners-of-war at Ambo until 1942.\nAt least as early as 1955, there was a 170 kW hydro-electric power station in the town; by 1965 the installed electrical capacity was 210 kVA, with annual production of 132,000 kWh. In 1958 Ambo was one of 27 places in Ethiopia ranked as First Class Township. That same year, the Ambo Agricultural School and Ambo Forestry School had 150 students.

This was part of their strategy to avoid a direct assault on the capital, Addis Ababa, and instead surround the city and isolate it from the rest of the country.\nA prominent Oromo businessman, Daraaraa Kafani, was murdered in front of his home; eyewitnesses said he was slain by a man wearing a military uniform. His funeral was attended by thousands of Oromos in Ambo; police arrested more than 37 people, stating that they were supporters of the Oromo Liberation Front on 3 September. In the following February, 70 year old Oromo elder Dandana Gurmu was arrested on the accusation that he was a supporter of the OLF.\nOn 24 April 2003, a Tigrayan student was shot and killed and two others injured in a clash between Oromo and Tigrayan students at the Ambo Agricultural College.

The freighter was delivered to the Navy at Montreal, Quebec, Canada, on 21 September 1918 and was placed in commission the following day for service in the Naval Overseas Transportation Service. Aries was named for the constellation.\nAfter fitting out, the freighter sailed for France late in October and arrived at St. Nazaire on 11 November, the day Germany signed the armistice ending the fighting of World War I. Lake Geneva was then assigned to European waters. Based at Cardiff, Wales, she carried coal from that port and from Belfast, Ireland, to French ports.\nAfter continuing this duty through the spring of 1919, she sailed for Charleston, South Carolina, carrying some 1,500 tons of Army ordnance material. However, while en route to that port, she was diverted to Newport News, Virginia, where she arrived on 12 July.\nBetween the wars\nAfter discharging her cargo, Lake Geneva was slated for demobilization.

Foreign policy involves goals, strategies, measures, management methods, guidelines, directives, agreements, and so on. National governments may conduct international relations not only with other nation-states but also with international organizations and non-governmental organizations.\nManaging foreign relations need carefully considered plans of actions that are adapted to foreign interests and concerns of the government.\nStudy\nForeign policy analysis (FPA) involves the study of how a state makes foreign policy. As it analyzes the decision making process, FPA involves the study of both international and domestic politics. FPA also draws upon the study of diplomacy, war, intergovernmental organizations, and economic sanctions, each of which are means by which a state may implement foreign policy. In academia, FPA is most commonly taught within the discipline of public policy within political science or political studies, and the study of international relations. FPA can also be considered a sub-field of the study of international relations (IR), which aims to understand the processes behind foreign policy decision making.

The most prominent scholars in this field of study include Richard Snyder, James Rosenau, Alexander George, Graham Allison and Irving Janis.\nAccording to foreignpolicyanalysis.org,  As a field of study, FPA is characterized by its actor-specific focus. In the simplest terms, it is the study of the process, effects, causes, or outputs of foreign policy decision-making in either a comparative or case-specific manner. The underlying and often implicit argument theorizes that human beings, acting as a group or within a group, compose and cause change in international politics.  In other words, FPA can be understood as a critique of the dominant structuralist approaches in IR.\nStages in decision making\nThe making of foreign policy involves a number of stages:\nAssessment of the international and domestic political environment - Foreign policy is made and implemented within an international and domestic political context, which must be understood by a state in order to determine the best foreign policy option. For example, a state may need to respond to an international crisis.\nGoal setting - A state has multiple foreign policy goals. A state must determine which goal is affected by the international and domestic political environment at any given time. In addition, foreign policy goals may conflict, which will require the state to prioritize.\nDetermination of policy options - A state must then determine what policy options are available to meet the goal or goals set in light of the political environment.

This will involve an assessment of the state's capacity implement policy options and an assessment of the consequences of each policy option.\nFormal decision making action - A formal foreign policy decision will be taken at some level within a government. Foreign policy decisions are usually made by the executive branch of government. Common governmental actors or institutions which make foreign policy decisions include: the head of state (such as a president) or head of government (such as a prime minister), cabinet, or minister.\nImplementation of chosen policy option - Once a foreign policy option has been chosen, and a formal decision has been made, then the policy must be implemented. Foreign policy is most commonly implemented by specialist foreign policy arms of the state bureaucracy, such as a Ministry of Foreign Affairs or State Department. Other departments may also have a role in implementing foreign policy, such as departments for: trade, defence, and aid.\nKey approaches\n(as put forward by Graham T. Allison in 1969. For a more comprehensive description see his Book Essence of Decision 1971 1999)\nRational actor model\nThe rational actor model is based on rational choice theory.

The model adopts the state as the primary unit of analysis, and inter-state relations (or international relations) as the context for analysis. The state is seen as a monolithic unitary actor, capable of making rational decisions based on preference ranking and value maximization.\nAccording to the rational actor model, a rational decision making process is used by a state. This process includes:\nGoal setting and ranking.\nConsideration of options.\nAssessment of consequences.\nProfit maximization.\nIn other words, it provides models for answering the question: with that information what would be the best decision for reaching one's goal? In this theory, the underlying assumption is that governments are unified and rational, in this manner, they would seek for carefully planned and well-defined foreign policy goals. In this sense, rational choice model is primarily a realist perspective of foreign policy level of analysis.\nThe rational actor model has been subject to criticism. The model tends to neglect a range of political variables, of which Michael Clarke includes:  political decisions, non-political decisions, bureaucratic procedures, continuations of previous policy, and sheer accident.  It also ignores emotions, emotional flooding, selective attention, and groupthink.\nGovernmental Bargaining Model\nIn this model the state is not seen as a monolithic unitary actor.

Instead it is a collection of different bureaucracies vying for increasing their funding and size. Individual decision makers try to bargain and compete for influence with their own particular goal in mind. Things are often viewed as a zero-sum game where one bureaucracy's  win  or increasing their level of funding is seen as a loss for another bureaucracy. Here decisions are made by bureaucracies competing against each other and suggesting solutions to problems that would involve using their resources so as to increase their level of importance. Bureaucratic politics model, in keeping with its pluralistic connotation, can also refer to that inner state processes including no institutional actors, who with their informal channels would affect policy results.\nOrganizational Process Model\nOrganizational Processes model emerges from clusters of governmental organizations that look after their own best interests and follow 'standard operating procedures'. In this model different bureaucracies have different standard operating procedures. These procedures are made in order to allow day-to-day operations to be carried out. Often an order or decision will have to work around these standard procedures. It is often exceedingly difficult for a bureaucracy to do something  out of character  or contrary to their standard procedures.\nOther models\nInter-branch politics model\nSelf-aggrandizement model - In this model one leader acts on behalf of his or her interests.

On June 15, 2016, Karamarko resigned as First Deputy Prime Minister.\nAfter Karamarko's resignation from the place of First Deputy Prime Minister, HDZ decided to run a revenge motion of no confidence against prime minister Orešković The vote took place on 16 June 2016 and it was successful with 125 MPs in favor, 15 against and 2 abstentions, which caused the government to collapse. HDZ then tried to form a new majority in the parliament with no success, despite party members claiming that they have the support of sufficient number MPs. Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović, therefore decided to schedule the new parliamentary elections for September 2016. As a consequence of failing to form a new majority in the parliament, Karamarko decided to resign from his position of president of Croatian Democratic Union on 21 June 2016. One month later, Andrej Plenković was elected as Karamarko's successor on head of HDZ.\nPost resignation\nAfter resignation, Karamarko spent some time traveling around the world and in May 2017, he announced that he decided to establish a think-tank organisation - Institute for Security and Prosperity of Croatia.

    "text": "Glove stretcher is a 19th century device for  easing  (stretching) the gloves. The rounded tips of the stretchers, typically made of two wooden pieces hinged in the middle and spring-loaded, were placed inside the fingers of a glove. The handles were then squeezed so the fingers were stretched, allowing the glove to be put on without damaging it. The scissors-like implements were also made from metal and celluloid.\nHistory\nGlove stretchers were popular in the Victorian era. \nKid leather was considered to be the best material for gloves worn by a proper Victorian lady, as cotton and silk were easily stretchable, thus revealing the imperfections of a hand. The leather of a young goat was essential to emulate the desired appearance of a hand with tapered fingertips. The scissor-like stretchers were helping to preserve the shape of the glove fingers after washing.\nA 1908 advice on washing the chamois gloves suggests using the stretcher as an alternative to washing and drying the gloves on hands.\nIn the 19th century the stretchers were widespread, every  good  shop or household was expected to have one. In the 21st century the original device resembling the scissors is largely forgotten. Haglund reports that while playing a version of the Kim's game, children are no longer able to guess the purpose of the implement.\nReferences\nSources\nNational Coal Mining Museum (2021).

This is the only Bulgarian government without a prime minister.\nPolicies\nImmediately after the Second Grand National Assembly completed its work, a new cabinet without a prime minister was formed, in which the conservatives and Russian generals played a leading role. The knyaz skillfully used the military generals and their Russian influence to solidify his position after the coup.During its one-year administration, the government conducted a number of constructive reforms: the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Religion was restructured according to a more modern European model; a State Council was formed; the gendarmerie came under the authority of the Ministry of War.

L. 90 363, 82 Stat. 250, enacted June 28, 1968) is an Act of Congress that permanently moved two federal holidays in the United States to a Monday, being Washington's Birthday and Memorial Day, and further made Columbus Day a federal holiday, also permanently on a Monday. This created long weekends with three days off ending with the holidays, such as Memorial Day Weekend.\nVeterans Day was moved from November 11 to the fourth Monday in October, but in 1978, it was returned to November 11, the actual date of the end of World War I and celebrated in several European countries as Armistice Day.\nThe Act was signed into law on June 1, 1968, and took effect on January 1, 1971.\nBackground\nThe Act was designed to increase the number of long weekends for federal employees, a favorite goal of the travel industry. Veterans Day was removed from this list of  always-on-Monday  holidays when it was moved back to its traditional date of November 11, by act of Congress in 1975, effective 1978.\nThis Act did not officially change the name of Washington's Birthday to Presidents Day, nor did it combine Washington's Birthday with Lincoln's Birthday, despite suggestions that those two changes be made.

Many US states have adopted some version of the Presidents Day name. The perception that the name was changed stems from the fact that the act placed federal observance of Washington's Birthday in the week of February 15 to 21 and, since that week always falls between Lincoln's birthday (February 12) and Washington's (February 22), but never includes either date, popular references have given rise to the title, which recognizes both Presidents. As of 1998, a dozen U.S. states officially refer to the holiday as  Presidents' Day.  Lincoln's Birthday holiday with very limited exceptions is no longer observed at all, at least on its actual date, though some states combine it with Washington's Birthday.\nThough the holiday was not in existence at the time, Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, which was established in 1983 and first observed in 1986, is celebrated on the third Monday in January, which falls on January 15 21, instead of King's actual birth date, January 15, for the same reasons.\nEffects\nThe Monday holiday dates this act established were:\nWashington's Birthday: third Monday in February (formerly February 22)\nMemorial Day: last Monday in May (formerly May 30)\nColumbus Day: second Monday in October (previously observed only in some states on October ",

Hadad was born in Chetumal, Quintana Roo, Mexico and currently lives in Mexico City. Of Mayan and Lebanese heritage, growing up near the Belize border and able to hear Caribbean radio stations coming from Cuba has been hugely influential on her heterogeneous perspective on social and cultural national life. Coupled with that, her incessant desire to critique the powers that be, her background as a political science major in college, her ongoing explorations in non-traditional theatrical forms, is all that fuels Hadad's unique political cabaret performances. As Roselyn Constantino has written,   o ut of Hadad s meditations on the multiplicity of influences shaping her and other Mexican's  sic  sense of themselves, and on the violence implicity  sic  in that process, emerge performances featuring a fast-paced, fragmented, parodic unveiling of traditional Mexican song, dress, and dance.

It closed after its 500th performance, in the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City. Also in the 1980s, a major television appearance was her role as Margarita in the Televisa-produced telenovela Teresa (1989), which starred fellow Mexican Lebanese actor Salma Hayek. In the early 1990s, Hadad was cast in the role of Teresa de Teresa in Alfonso Cuarón's first full-feature film, Sólo con tu pareja (Only With Your Partner), a film that, although lighthearted and comedic, includes AIDS in its story, something not openly discussed in the Mexican public sphere at that time.

But it was not about reproducing European modes of cabaret, Hadad was also interested in Mexican popular theater (teatro de carpa and teatro de revista), humor, and style to begin to create her particular mode of political cabaret.

Due to the interest and use of ranchera music in these, led to Hadad to produce and star in the tragicomic musical La Occisa or Luz, Levántate y Lucha based on the life of Mexican singer Lucha Reyes (1904-1944), a relatively famous ranchera singer, but who had gone into obscurity by the second half of the twentieth century. Hadad began to claim Reyes as the one who initiated the canto bravío (what later became ranchera music) in Mexico, but has not received this credit. Hadad states in an interview in 1997  traditionally women would sing the campirana song or bucolic songs with soft voices, with very high pitch. Women did not use the same force in singing compared to a man and Lucha (Reyes) is the one who initiates this type of ranchera singing in a bravía way among women. Because of that she changed the vernacular song . In addition to ranchera music, cabaret, teatro de carpa, and teatro de revista, films from the so-called golden age of Mexican cinema, especially the rumbera whose plots were set primarily in urban cabarets, were also highly influential in Hadad's visual and highly dramatic language.

Ciboulette's character is tragically punished for standing up for love.\nThe Leader (Tarzan): The leader of the group of contrabandists. A 21-year-old man who crosses the Canada US border to retrieve cigarettes, and smuggles them into Québec to be sold. He falls in love with Ciboulette, but recognizes that they cannot really be together. Tarzan is the  psychologically disturbed  victim  of circumstance  whose façade of control disappears during his interrogation, where it is revealed that his real name is François Boudreau and that he is an orphan. Only in death does Tarzan realize that he is already condemned due to his birth into the proletariat class, and that he cannot escape his fate.\nThe Traitor (Passe-Partout): The traitor who accidentally leads the authorities to the abandoned warehouse where their stash of cigarettes is hidden, and who betrays Tarzan by telling the police that Tarzan crossed the US-Canada border the day a border-control officer was killed. It is revealed during his interrogation that his real name is René Langlois, and that he joined the group to provide food for his mother, because his father is an alcoholic who spends his salary on drinking.

He is often seen as a realist in the play as he is the only one in the group that knows he is a criminal.\nThe Unimportant Guy (Tit-Noir): The group's accountant. It is revealed during his interrogation that his real name is Arsène Larue, and that he joined the group to obtain money for his future family and to study to become a priest. His nickname is  Tit-Noir  because when he was little, he had black hair, so his father called him  Petit-Noir , which eventually became  Tit-Noir . Tit-Noir serves a function similar to the messenger in Greek tragedy.\nThe 'Somewhat Slightly Less Intelligent' (Moineau): At the age of 20, he is the most artistic of the group. He often plays the harmonica, and joined the group so that he could become a musician. His name comes from the French word for sparrow, a humorous way of calling him a featherbrain.

Ciboulette, the youngest of the group and the only female, is in love with Tarzan, but does not reveal this despite Tit-Noir's urging, as she is worried it will ruin the business.

While the others wait for Tarzan to return, Passe-Partout attempts to supplant as the gang's leader, and disobeys Tarzan's instructions by stealing a wallet from a passerby, who is actually a detective, Ledoux. Tarzan returns to the hideout but Ledoux arrives at the gang's hideout and arrests the teenagers with a police brigade.\nThe second act begins in the police station's interrogation room. Each member is questioned individually. During the interrogations, the police receive a call informing them that a border patrol guard was murdered earlier that day. The police chief interrogates Passe-Partout, who reveals that Tarzan had crossed the border that day. Under the impression that the other gang members have betrayed him, Tarzan confesses to the murder of the border guard.\nIn the third act, the group talks about what they will do to Tarzan at the prison, and how they will execute him. Later on, it is seen on the news that Tarzan has escaped from prison. He goes straight to the  Hangar  where they keep the cigarettes.

The characters in Zone, trapped within the poverty of their social milieu, resort to  adolescent ideals  in an attempt to escape. Laroche suggests that the teenaged gang members are play-acting as the characters they saw in films. Dubé's characters reveal their deepest thoughts and feelings in their dialogue, reflecting their underlying helplessness. The irony is that the gang, who began engaging in criminal activities to escape the societal  grey zone  they inhabit, are ultimately punished by the same society that offered them no support.

It also deals with the complicated romantic relationship between a 21-year-old man, Tarzan; and a 16-year-old girl, Ciboulette.\nReception\nEdwin Hamblet criticized Zone for its  sudden and perfunctory  conclusion, finding that  Dubé tends to have trouble in ending his plays  and citing the artificiality of the plot twists. In 1953, Zone was awarded the Grand Prix for the best Canadian play at the Victoria National Drama Festival.

Others are unique to the Sikh tradition, such as Waheguru, Akal Purakh, and Sarabloh. Employment of these terms does not mean Sikhs accept the religious context in which they are understood in their original sources. For example, the meaning of the words Hari or Ram as used by Sikhs does not mean the same thing as these terms do in the Hindu (particularity Vaishnav) traditions. Usage of these names does not mean Sikhs conceptualize their concept of God in the form of the incarnated devas or devis from Indic mythology, but rather they are used to describe various aspects of God as per Sikh theology. \nThe Sikh gurus adopted the names for the divine from various faith systems as they saw these sectarian differences in linguistics as unimportant in-comparison to the actual message they were trying to spread. On page 64 of the Guru Granth Sahib, various Islamicate terms for God are also presented freely.\nYour names are countless.

Kangju existed from the 1st century BC until the 5th century AD. Its capital was reportedly at or near Bityan. After being subject to several different waves of invaders, Kangju collapsed into several independent states situated mainly in the Syr Darya valley and its tributaries of Keles and Atysi.\nThere are records that portray the determination of earlier names of Farab.

It is thought that a group of coins collected in Otrar and some towns of the oasis date back to the time of these records. There is a generic symbol of the Turgeshi in the form of a bow on the obverse of such coins and the image of a lion on the reverse side. On a second type of coin, there is an  X  sign on the reverse side; these may originate from the mint of a local ruler. There is a suggestion that the coins of the second type were minted by rulers of the Turkic state of Kangu Tarban, the population of which were the Kangars. According to the coins, in the 6th to 8th centuries, Kangu Tarban was ruled by a local dynasty of the Kangars, and their capital became a Tarban town named Turarband that was later to be called Otrar. Since the times of the golden hordes, the ruins of Otrar have been attractive because of rumours about the treasures of the ancient rulers, and about buried piles of gold coins and jewelry. The source of such legends was perhaps confirmed by the archaeological finds of various coins and jewelry.\nIn the 9th to the 10th centuries, various sources refer to Otrar as one of the Ispidjab towns.

The structure was created due to the collision of tectonic plates about 59-75 million years ago that drove a several mile thick wedge of Precambrian rock 50 mi (80 km) eastwards, causing it to overlie softer Cretaceous age rock that is 1300 to 1400 million years younger.\nThe décollement can be seen from Marias Pass as a thin tan line of rock roughly halfway up Summit Mountain and Little Dog Mountain.\nGeography\nThe Canadian Rocky Mountain foreland thrust and fold belt is a northeastward tapering deformational belt consisting of Mesoproterozoic, Paleozoic, and Mesozoic strata. The Lewis thrust sheet is one of the major structures of the foreland thrust and fold belt extending over 280 mi (450 km) from Mount Kidd near Calgary, AB in the Southeast Canadian Cordillera to Steamboat Mountain, located west of Great Falls, Northwest Montana in the United States.

Most of the Canadian Cordillera today consists of numerous tectonostratigraphic terranes that were accreted to the stable margin of North America from the Jurassic to Early Tertiary as a result of eastward and northward drifting island arcs that collided with the continental lithosphere of North America. These terranes were accreted due to upper-crustal rocks being detached from the denser lower-crustal and proto-Pacific upper mantle lithosphere that was subducted under the North American craton. The allochthonous upper crustal terranes were juxtaposed over top of each other and over the western margin of the North American craton along a system of interconnected, northeast and southwest verging major thrust faults.\nRise of the Rockies and formation of the Rocky Mountain Thrust and Fold Belt\nThe onset of deformation of the Rocky Mountain fold and thrust belt was due to collisional tectonic forces that occurred on the west edge of the North American craton.

A profound unconformity separates the sedimentary cover from the Archean to Paleoproterozoic crystalline crust of North America. This thrust and fold belt has a thin skinned geometry as indicated by the array of thrust faults that interleave and overlap along strike and cut across strata at low to moderate angle that flatten with depth, repeat the same Cambrian to Triassic stratigraphy from thrust sheet to thrust sheet, and merge into a common basal décollement, the Rocky Mountain basal décollement.

The thrust sheets involved in the Canadian Rocky Mountain foreland thrust and fold belt consist of different aged strata indicative of significant deformation over time. The dominant structure of the deformational belt is a series of thrust faults, which are mostly listric and north-easterly or easterly verging. These thrust faults follow long bedding parallel detachments separated by ramps. As a result, a series of overlying thrust sheets is produced that follow their associated fault detachments. In addition, there is a westward dipping basal detachment that extends into the Cordilleran metamorphic core at mid-crustal levels.

Studies and modern dating have found that eastward propagation of thrusting took place in four distinct pulses that are separated by relative tectonic quiescence. 40Ar 39Ar dates indicate that these pulses occurred in the Late Jurassic (163-146 Ma), middle Cretaceous (103-99 Ma), Late Cretaceous (76-68 Ma), and late Paleocene- early Eocene (57-51 Ma), separated by quiescent periods of  40 Ma,  20 Ma, and  10 Ma respectively.\nThe Rockies were uplifted during the Laramide Orogeny which occurred between 80 and 55 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous to the Early Paleocene as a result of subduction of the Kula and Farallon plates beneath the North American continent. Furthermore, the first radiometric ages obtained from direct dating of thrust-fault gouge from the front ranges of the southern Canadian Rockies identified two distinct deformation episodes named the  Rundle pulse  and the  McConnell pulse .

These pulses were dated and are interpreted to have occurred at 72 Ma and 52 Ma respectively.\nLewis thrust system\nThe Lewis thrust Is a low-angle thrust fault in which Precambrian sediments have been thrust over younger Cretaceous sediments. The thrust sheet is constrained by lateral ramps on either side. In the south this occurs near Marias Pass, Montana, where the ramp geometry is parallel to the direction of sheet movement. In the north, the thrust sheet is forced up and over an oblique ramp near the Kootenay Pass region in British Columbia. The overall shape of the thrust sheet as it moved north-eastward has a general convex shape towards the foreland.\nThe Lewis sheet is carried by the Lewis thrust fault where the compression and thrusting (in the southern Canadian Rocky Mountains Foothills and Eastern Front ranges) was associated with oblique, right-hand convergence between the Intermontane terrane and the North American craton. This transpression in the Late Cretaceous led to the tectonic inversion of the Cordilleran miogeocline and the Belt-Purcell basin as the Lewis sheet began to buckle and fold, where strata was then overturned until a break or fault was formed.

Similarly, the thick succession of Mesoproterozoic strata consisting of the Belt-Purcell supergroup followed the same sequence of events leading to the structural culmination seen in the southern end of the Purcell anticlinorium.\nThe Lewis thrust is cut by two major extensional fault systems, the Flathead fault and the Rocky Mountain trench fault system. Both of which are late Eocene to Miocene in age. However, the amount of shortening that has taken place on the thrust is not connected to Eocene extension due to the Rocky Mountain trench fault system and the Flathead fault having no influence positionally on the footwall and hanging wall cutoffs of the Lewis thrust. Instead, this transpression was replaced with transtension in the early Eocene involving east west crustal extension and tectonic exhumation, which brought up mid-crustal metamorphic rocks to the surface to be exposed.

Additionally, this transition from transpression to transtension resulted in rapid cooling of the metamorphic core complexes as they were exhumed and brought to the surface. Dextral transtension on intracontinental strike-slip faults in northeastern and southwestern British Columbia culminated with the mid Eocene extensional exhumation of midcrustal metamorphic core complexes. This leads to the basal décollement being exposed and the association with north south faulting, dyke emplacement, and voluminous magmatism, which in turn, marked cessation of crustal shortening. Paleotemperatures and geothermal gradients indicate that the Lewis thrust sheet was 7.5 8.4 mi (12 13.5 km) thick when thrusting commenced.\nDuplexes\nThrust faults often associate three types of structures, imbricate fan structures, ramp-flat structures, and duplex structures, all of which are seen within the Lewis thrust and the Rocky Mountain thrust and fold belt. Duplex structures are common and have been located in numerous locations along the Lewis thrust.

Two windows in this section showing exposures of Upper Cretaceous strata exposed beneath the Lewis Thrust occur adjacent to the Flathead Fault. Within these windows, the Lewis thrust is folded along with overlying and underlying strata in a series of northwest-trending anticlinal culminations that extend the length of the west side of the salient. Furthermore, two distinct structural levels can be seen in this section, an upper level comprising the majority of the mass of the Lewis thrust sheet which is characterized by broad open folds in relatively undeformed rocks, and a fairly thin lower level consisting of stacked imbricate, southwest-facing, sigmoidal thrust fault slices, bounded below by the Lewis thrust, and above by a separate bedding-parallel thrust called the Tombstone thrust.

Erosion over time has shaped the mountains into their characteristic shape, where they tower over the associated prairies.\nGeochronology\nThe fault motion of the Lewis thrust is dated based on the oldest age for motion being defined by the youngest sediments on the footwall, which are said to be about 65 million years old. Fission track analysis of Uranium-bearing minerals such as Zircons and Apatite which involves dating the radioactive uranium found in sediments along the Lewis thrust using isotopic ratios of Uranium provides constraints of the late pre-deformational paleogeothermal gradient and thickness of the Lewis sheet. This data, after being calibrated into geologic ages, led to the conclusion that maximum burial and heating in the Lewis thrust occurred during the Campanian over a time interval of less than 15 million years prior to the start of movement of the thrust sheet.

This is supported by locations further south along the thrust fault in Montana where faults on the leading edge cut through a 76 Ma volcanic marker proving that the onset of fault movement must be younger than 76 Ma.\nThe Youngest movement along the fault or in other words, the end of movement for thrust movement is based on the stratigraphic and structural characteristics of early Eocene deposits and is limited by the age of normal faults that cut the thrust and the associated sediments found within these normal faults. Additionally, The cooling of the metamorphic core complexes that arose and were exhumed is said to mark the end of deformation of the thrust belt which was done by using radiometric Uranium in zircons to provide a cooling age that is consistent with tectonic transition from compression to extension.

In addition, the same faults in Montana that cut a volcanic marker were also found to be cut by 59 Ma porphyry dikes. This limits the youngest age for movement to have occurred at 59 Ma. Together, dates revealed for oldest and youngest movement along the fault place the overall movement of the Lewis thrust fault to have occurred over a span of about 15 Ma in the Late Cretaceous to Early Paleocene periods between 75 and 59 Ma.\nPaleotemperatures have been derived from vitrinite reflectance by measure of the percentage of incident light reflected from the surface of vitrinite particles in a sedimentary rock from the Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous formation along the Lewis thrust.

In one study, seismic data recorded along the 49 N parallel (the border between Canada and the US) was recorded from the Rocky Mountain trench fault in the foreland belt to the east flank of the Moyie anticline of the Purcell anticlinorium, which is thought to be the location where the Lewis fault tapers off. Seismic data produced showed total displacement of 115 km of the Lewis thrust sheet. This was done by locating the position of the footwall cutoff of the Lewis sheet which is interpreted in the seismic section as truncated reflectors at 11 15 km depth underlying the Purcell anticlinorium and overlying the basement reflectors. 75 km East along the profile is the exposure of the Lewis fault in the Waterton area, which directly links to the most displaced portion of the",

Results showed that there was 75 km of direct movement of the thrust sheet along the Lewis fault, and an additional 40 km of transport by the formation of footwall-domain duplexes. Although this study did not take into consideration that it could be possible that the Lewis thrust sheet moved further east along the prairies and was eroded away, the data proved to be of high quality as it allowed excellent ties to be made to previous drill holes, mapped structures, measured stratigraphy, and existing geologic and seismic data. This study acted as a reinforcement to previous work and was very consistent with previous data collected. Additionally, this seismic data presented is significant in extensional terms as a direct link between reflectors on the West and East sides of the Rocky Mountain trench correlate to the same stratigraphic unit, where extension can be restored and an extensional distance of about 10 km was calculated by the difference of the pre extension and post extension.\nThere is controversy over how the overthrust movement occurred and the effect this movement had on the surrounding geology.

More specifically, attempting to determine if the thrust movement was continuous or if movement was subject to a more stick-slip style of movement remains inconclusive. However, the anomalously high vitrinite reflectance values obtained from the Lewis thrust at Marias Pass, the McConnell thrust at Mt. Yamnuska, the Coleman fault at Wintering Creek and several others indicate temperatures of 350 650  C were generated during thrusting. Furthermore, these high vitrinite reflectance values were restricted to extremely narrow sections adjacent to and within the fault zones. This is indicative that the high temperatures were fairly short-lived. Thus, the high temperatures are interpreted to be the result of frictional heating during stick slip faulting. Evidence for the local high temperatures within the fault zone indicate that local areas of frictional stress must have existed, with the possibility of this occurring due to ramps in the fault plane where drainage of high pore pressures may have occurred. Moreover, samples from the hanging wall collected in close proximity to the fault plane show no evidence for heating during progressive burial of sediments. This absence of evidence for heating during faulting is indicative of low frictional stress and therefore, low rates of slip. This shows solid agreement with the evolution of the Canadian Rocky mountain foreland thrust and fold belt, including the Lewis thrust sheet which has been interpreted to have developed and commenced movement in pulses.\nReferences\n Geology Fieldnotes: Glacier National Park, Montana .

The verses of Alvars are compiled as Nalayira Divya Prabandham and the 108 temples revered are classified as Divya Desam. Poigai is one of the three principal Alvars, with the other two being Bhoothath Alvar and Peyalvar, collectively called Mutalamalvargal, who are regarded to be born out of divinity. Poigai composed hundred verses that are classified as Mutal Tiruvantati, and his composition is set in the antati style, in which the ending syllable is the starting one for the next verse.\nAccording to traditional account, the first three Alvars belong to Dvapara Yuga (before 4200 BCE). As per Hindu legend, Poigai was found in a small pond near the Yadhotakaari temple at Tiruvekkaa. In Tamil, small pond is called poigai, and since he was found in a pond, he got the name Poigai.\nAs per legend, the three Alvars were once confined in a small dark enclosure during a rain in Thirukovilur and they experienced a fourth individual among them.

Bhoothath Alvar arrived there looking for a hiding place and Poigai Alvar accommodated him, with both sitting together. In the meanwhile, Pei Alvar also came to the same place as all the three preferred to stand because of lack of space. The darkness became dense and inside the small room, they were not able to see each other. In the meanwhile, they felt a fourth person also forced his way among them.

It contains the only dikes in the White Peak. Boreholes have enabled the extraction of significant amounts of water, used by local industry.\nBefore the quarrying, the southern part of the valley was described as  narrow, flat-bottomed, rocky...  with  almost perpendicular cliffs of limestone on either side... , whereas the northern part was broader and grassy.\nHistory\nThe dale fell within the bounds of the mediaeval Forest of High Peak. The surrounding land was first farmed in about 1250, by people connected with the nearby hamlet of Tunstead.\nIn 1867, an extension of the Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway was opened, running through the valley between Peak Forest and Millers Dale. This section of line remains open, for freight traffic, now known as the Great Rocks Line after this area.\nThe valley is now dominated by Tunstead Quarry, a large limestone quarry, worked since 1929. Given its economic importance, the boundary of the Peak District National Park was carefully drawn to exclude the dale. By 1973, Tunstead was the largest quarry in Europe, and permission",

By 1973, Tunstead was the largest quarry in Europe, and permission to extend it into the National Park was rejected on the grounds that there was sufficient stone to last until at least 2000. Following a Public Inquiry and a High Court case, the Secretary of State ultimately overrode the National Park Authority's decision and granted permission for a 148.57-hectare (367.1-acre) extension within the Peak District National Park. It remains the largest producer of limestone in the Peak District, with about 5.5 million tonnes extracted each year.\nIn 1932, quarrying opened a fissure which contained remains of bison, Irish elk and deer, washed down from the surface in the distant past. In 1957, the painter Peter Lanyon visited the valley to study the faces of the quarry, seeing them as revealing both the geological and human history of the area.\nSee also\nBuxton lime industry\n   References",

Land for the town was purchased because it was inexpensive old farm land that had artesian wells. It was also located near the Santa Fe Railroad line. Ranchers, farmers, skilled workers, teachers, and business people were lured to the town in south Tulare County, California.\nSeveral events led to the closing of the town. Allen, who was the leader of the town, died in an accident in 1914. Over time, the town experienced a shortage of water. The Great Depression and World War II drew people to places with greater opportunities. More people left when three of the town's wells were found to have arsenic in 1965. Wishing to maintain the historic town, supporters lobbied to make the area a park. Governor Ronald Reagan signed the legislation to make a park from some of the land in 1973.

It was updated in 1985 from funding attained from historic development section of the California Parks and Recreation Facilities Act of 1984.\nWomen's Improvement League\nWhile living in Allensworth, Leavell founded the Women's Improvement League. She also provided the land for the founding of the Mary Dickinson Memorial Library. The founding of the library developed out of a library being approved by the Allensworth Board of Trustees. The reading room they approved was too small for the community. Leavell therefore created the property to develop more land for a larger library. The library is named after her mother and was completed in July 1913. The building of the library cost  500. It could hold 1,000 books. The Allensworths donated their personal book collection to the library.

The club colours came about as one of the founders, Peter Kavanagh, had two sets of jerseys, one green and the other red. Originally the main colours were to be green and white (the colours of Saint Patrick and the shamrock) but because neighbouring clubs Round Towers and Lucan Sarsfields used green and white, it was decided to use red and white and keep the green as second colours.\nThe first match to ever take place was the U13 s against Round Towers of Clondalkin which John Daly (founder and current club President) refereed. The match took place in a field where the Assembly Hall and St Brigid's School currently stands today.\nThe first championship won was U16 1 2 football in 1966. St Patrick's have traditionally been stronger in football but in recent times have enjoyed more success on the hurling front.

This decision was born out of their genuine concern of the land's wildlife. In 1969 it was established by Shaikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan and in 1972 it opened to the public. Among the species they wanted to protect were ungulates such as the Arabian oryx.\nToday, the zoo hosts over 4,000 animals, some of them extinct in the wild, some endangered. It features a big cat house containing lions, mountain lions, jaguars, black panthers, leopards, and cheetahs. In addition, it has a reptile house, monkey compounds, an aquarium, and an aviary. From February 2010 until July 2010, the Al Ain Zoo hosted the  Dinosaur Trail,  a small section that includes around 15 to 20 mechanical dinosaurs with sensors, such as Tyrannosaurus rex. It included information about each dinosaur, living habits, natural habitat and basic features. \nIn April 2019 the zoo began its expansion program in order to build new compounds' areas and sites, such as the conservation and breeding centres, African Safari, World Desert Zoo, and the Sheikh Zayed Desert Learning Centre.\nIn March 2022, as",

They stated that according to their Code of Ethics it is essential from time to time to make such actions. This is needed in light of global efforts of conservation breeding programs, education programs, or basic biological studies. Having said that, they continued their statement that concluded that the zoo's intention to import African elephants does not meet WAZA's Code of Ethics. The outcome of that statement was the decision to terminate Al Ain Zoo membership in WAZA until further notice.\nFollowing that event and statement, on September 15, 2022, the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) also announced the termination of the membership of Al Ain Zoo in the United Arab Emirates. The zoo s membership ended on December 31, 2022, following the decision of the EAZA Council that EAZA can no longer reasonably be expected to allow the institution to remain a member. The decision comes after careful examination of evidence related to importing wild-caught African elephants from Namibia, which the Council agreed constituted multiple breaches of EAZA Codes and Standards. \nOn August 14th it was reported that for the first time in years three Arabian sand cats were born in the zoo.\nGallery\nSee also\nAl Hefaiyah Conservation Centre\nDubai Dolphinarium\nDubai Safari Park\nDubai Zoo\nEmirates Park Zoo near Abu Dhabi City\nSir Bani Yas in the Western Region\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Al Ain Zoo at Wikimedia Commons\nOfficial website",

This species features 49 pairs of legs and can reach 85 mm in length.\nDiscovery\nThis centipede was first described in 1900 by the Austrian myriapodologist Carl Attems. He based the original description of this centipede on two specimens, an adult male and a juvenile. These specimens were found on the island of Mahé in Seychelles.\nTaxonomy\nAttems originally described this centipede as a subspecies of Mecistocephalus punctifrons. In 1902, the Swiss zoologists Henri de Saussure and Leo Zehntner elevated M. glabridorsalis to the rank of species. Some other authors, however, continued to deem this centipede a subspecies or a junior synonym of M. punctifrons. Authorities now regard M. glabridorsalis as an accepted species.\nIn 1981, the French myriapodologist Jean-Marie Demange described M. vanmoli as a new species based on specimens found on the island of Mahé in Seychelles. In 2010, the Italian biologists Lucio Bonato and Alessandro Minelli deemed M. vanmoli to be a junior synonym of M. glabridorsalis. Consequently",

The body is mostly yellow with some dark pigment on the dorsal surface of the trunk, but the head and anterior segments are reddish brown. The head is about 1.6 to 1.9 times longer than wide.

The areolate area on the anterior part of the clypeus is about as long as the smooth areas on the posterior part of the clypeus (plagulae). This areolate area features about four pairs of setae arranged in a transverse row, but with the middle pair usually posterior to the others.

The claw on each of the second maxillae narrows abruptly into a tip that is usually rounded.\nThe first article of the forcipule features a small proximal tubercle and a large but obtuse distal tooth that points out from a wide base rather than forwards. The second and third articles of the forcipule each feature a small tubercle, with the tubercle on the third article larger than the one on the second. The base of the ultimate article of the forcipule features a small tubercle.

While it is primarily considered as a desperate attempt from Murat to retain the Neapolitan throne, the Rimini Proclamation was among the earliest calls for Italian unification. \nThe Rimini Proclamation is dated to 30 March 1815, when Murat's army was passing through Rimini in the Neapolitan War against the Austrian Empire, though it may have been published only after Murat's defeat at the Battle of Tolentino in May 1815.

In 1808, Napoleon named Joachim Murat as King of Naples; Murat had married Caroline Bonaparte, Napoleon's younger sister, in 1800.

On 11 January 1814, the Kingdom of Naples and the Austrian Empire signed the Treaty of Naples, under which Murat defected to the coalition. As part of the treaty, Murat would keep the Neapolitan throne in return for sending 30,000 troops against the Kingdom of Italy.

It calls on the  good and unhappy Italians of Milan, Bologna, Turin, Venice, Brescia, Modena,  and  Reggio  to  come together in firm union  for  a Constitution worthy of the century and of you .\nIn its desire for independence and constitutionalism, the proclamation was written to inspire liberal elites in northern Italy.\nAftermath\n400 volunteers joined Murat's army on 30 March 1815. Murat's eastern column advanced northwards from Rimini towards the River Po, entering Bologna on 2 April, while the western column reached Florence on 8 April. On the same day, the eastern column engaged 3,000 Austrian soldiers at the Battle of Occhiobello. Following its defeat at Occhiobello, it was pushed southwards, leading to Murat's decisive defeat at the Battle of Tolentino on 2 3 May. Murat returned to Naples on 18 May, where Caroline had already surrendered to the British, and fled immediately to southern France.\n",

Murat returned to Naples on 18 May, where Caroline had already surrendered to the British, and fled immediately to southern France.\nHearing of Napoleon's defeat at the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815, Murat fled to Corsica, from which he attempted an impossible invasion of Calabria. Napoleon remarked:  Murat attempted to reconquer with 200 men that territory which he failed to hold when he had 80,000 at his disposal.  Murat was captured, sentenced to death, and shot by firing squad in Pizzo Calabro on 13 October 1815.\nIn Il re lazzarone (1999), Risorgimento scholar Giuseppe Campolieti hypothesises that the Rimini Proclamation was only published on 12 May 1815, after Murat's defeat at Tolentino, and backdated to 30 March.\nLegacy\nThe Rimini Proclamation is primarily considered a desperate attempt from Murat to retain the Neapolitan throne. Nevertheless, and somewhat ironically for a French king, it was among the earliest calls for Italian unification and independence. The proclamation impressed poet Alessandro Manzoni, who wrote a song entitled Il proclama di Rimini , but he left it unfinished after Murat's campaign failed.\nSee also\n(in Italian) Text of unification and independence.

Like the modernists, and in contrast to primordialists, ethnosymbolist scholars agree nationalism is a distinctly modern phenomena.\nThe term was first used as  ethno-symbolist approach  in an article by Daniele Conversi, Smith's former student at the London School of Economics. However, Conversi was slightly critical, arguing:  if we focus exclusively on the power of the past and its symbols, we miss two other key features of nationalism: first, its relationship with political power, and particularly with the state; second, its crucial border-generating function .\nJohn A.

Armstrong\nArmstrong's contribution to ethnosymbolism is his  myth-symbol complexes  in Nations before Nationalism (1982), which firstly underlined the significance of la longue durée, according to Anthony D.

Armstrong believes that ethnic consciousness can far back in ancient civilisations such as Egypt, and that nationalism is merely  the final stage of a larger cycle of ethnic consciousness reaching back to the earliest forms of collective organization . Therefore, similar to the longue durée of Annales School, formation of ethnic identity should be examined across a timespan of many centuries.\nDrawing on the work of Fredrik Barth, Armstrong argues that  groups tend to define themselves not by reference to their own characteristics but by exclusion, that is, by comparison to 'strangers' . In other words, the character of a group is never fixed, and in accordance with group member's individual perceptions the boundaries of identities vary. Armstrong contrasts this to modern nationalist thought, which  has sought permanent  essences  of national character instead of recognizing the fundamental but shifting significance of boundaries for human identity . Despite these pursuits, Armstrong maintains that, historically,  persistent group identity did not ordinarily constitute the overriding legitimization of polity formation .\nNonetheless, for Armstrong,  myth, symbol, communication and cluster of associated attitudinal factors are usually more persistent than purely material factors , indicating his emphasis on the persistence of symbolic boundary mechanisms. He specified and analysed several factors that ensure such persistence.\nThe first such factor, also the most general one, is ways of life and the experiences associated with them.

He specified and analysed several factors that ensure such persistence.\nThe first such factor, also the most general one, is ways of life and the experiences associated with them. There are two fundamentally different ways of life: the nomadic and the sedentary. The second factor is religion, exemplified by Christianity and Islam, both of which gave birth to different civilizations and myths symbols. The third factor is city formation, whose effect upon ethnic identification requires examination of a host of factors ranging from the impact of town planning to the unifying of centrifugal effects of various legal codes, especially the Lübeck and Magdeburg law. The fourth factor is the role of imperial polities in maintaining myth-symbol complexes across dispersed geographical spaces. The final factor is language. Uniquely, Armstrong concludes that  the significance of language for ethnic identity is highly contingent  in the pre-modern era. Its significance relied on political and religious force and allegiances for centuries.\nIn his later works, Armstrong more explicitly agreed with modernists like Benedict Anderson and Eric Hobsbawm that national identity had been an invention, although he maintained an emphasis on  the antiquity of some inventions and the repertory of pre-existing group characteristics that inventors were able to draw upon .\nAnthony D.

Smith developed a distinct perspective from his teacher, best exemplified in the so-called  LSE debate  on nationalism (named by Gellner). Smith argues the  modern state cannot be understood without taking pre-existing ethnic components into account, the lack of which is likely to create a serious impediment to 'nation-building . Smith believed the definitions of  nation  and  nationalism  offered by both modernism and primordialism were limited. For him, the problem of modernism is mainly that modernists define nation as  modern nation  with characters of European nations of 18th and 19th centuries, making their definition Eurocentric and partial. Instead, Smith proposes an  ideal-typical  definition of the nation:  A named human population sharing an historic territory, common myths and historical memories, a mass, public culture, a common economy and common legal rights and duties for all members . Smith also introduces the important term ethnie, meaning  ethnic group , which is used to describe pre-modern ethnic communities. Ethnies contain six main attributes:\na collective proper name\na myth of common ancestry\nshared historical memories\none or more differentiating elements of common culture\nan association with a specific  homeland \na sense of solidarity for significant sectors of the population\nAccording to Smith, there are four main",

Lateral communities are usually made up of aristocrats and elites. For example, the Normans were united by shared myths of descent and the achievements of their dukes, but this identity was limited to the upper classes. On the other hand, vertical communities are more inclusive and connect different social classes through shared culture and history. For instance, the Israelite community united various social groups with common religious and historical traditions.

In later works, Smith added a third type: immigrant nations that consist of the fragments of other ethnies, such as the United States and Australia.\nAccording to Smith there are three ways in which the past may influence the national present:\nThrough the recurrence of the nation-form. The concept of the nation, Smith tells us, refers to a type of cultural resource and of human association that is potentially available in all periods of human history.\nThrough established continuities. Continuity can be found in  collective proper names, language codes and ethnic landscapes, all of which may linger on, even after the community to which they were attached has all but vanished . These components may also provide the framework for the revival of the community in a new form. Smith refers to the Greeks as a good example of this revival through continuity of names, language and landscapes.\nThrough appropriation and reinterpretation - exemplified in the tendency of later generations to rediscover, authenticate, and appropriate aspects of what they consider to be  their  ethnic past.\nJohn Hutchinson\nJohn Hutchinson was a PhD student of Smith's at the London School of Economics.

Political nationalists are essentially cosmopolitan rationalists whose conception of nation  looks forward ultimately to a common humanity transcending cultural differences . Although the fact that the world has been divided into multiple political communities has forced them to work within existing borders, political nationalists' objectives are to  secure a representative state for their community so that it might participate as an equal in the developing cosmopolitan rationalist civilization .\nIn contrast, cultural nationalists believe humanity is  infused with a creative force which endows all things with an individuality  similar to nature. They regard the state as accidental, since for them a nation is essentially a distinctive civilisation,  the product of its unique history, culture and geographical profile . Nations are organic entities and living personalities. Hutchinson contests that cultural nationalism hardly draws attention from theories of modernism.\nNot only has he challenged modernism in his earlier works, he has also engaged postmodernism in his more recent works, especially in Nations as Zones of Conflict (2005).\nCriticism\nThomas Hylland Eriksen says it is misleading to claim there is an unbroken continuity from pre-modern cultures to national ones.\nSimilarly, Walker Connor and John Breuilly criticize ethnosymbolists for",

Breuilly argues it is impossible to know from the evidence what meaning ethnic sentiments had for the majority of the people in the pre-modern era, going on to note how, unlike modern nations, many pre-modern identities lack an institutional basis through which national identity achieves form.\nBreuilly is also skeptical of anachronistic readings of cultural materials from the past, explaining how nationalist\nintellectuals and politicians seize upon myths and symbols in order to promote a particular national identity. Indeed, in many cases, he argues nationalists simply invent myths or ignore contrary evidence. Furthermore, in contrast to the ethnosymbolist emphasis on early symbols, myths, values and traditions, Breuilly states there are many nationalist movements that have succeeded without having a rich ethnohistory to feed upon.\nUmut Özkirimli and Spyros Sofos criticize the unproblematic relationship between nations and ethnies posited by Smith, suggesting that ethnosymbolist thinking is marked by  retrospective ethnicization .

In 1422 Emperor Sigismund Mundelsheim awarded municipal law. The Lords of Urbach participated in many robberies on traveling merchants. Therefore, the imperial cities of Heilbronn and Schwäbisch Hall moved in 1440 before with an army of 600 men on horseback against Mundelsheim and destroyed the community.\n1595 Mundelsheim was sold to the House of Württemberg. Until 1806 was Mundelsheim seat of an urban district that came up first in the rural district office Beilstein and then in the rural district office Marbach. When this was dissolved in 1938 in the course of municipal reform, the community fell to the rural district of Ludwigsburg, where it now belongs.\nReligion\nWhile the Reformation had prevailed in the neighboring municipalities of Württemberg since 1534, the Baden districts such as Mundelsheim and Besigheim did not follow suit until much later.

She sent one to Studio Ghibli because she had been a fan of their films for years. At the time, Arrietty was in pre-production and producer Toshio Suzuki wanted a Celtic-inspired film score. Less than ten days later, she received an email from Studio Ghibli about her CD. The envelope, because it was handwritten, had caught the eye of Suzuki, and he had listened to the CD. He was captivated by Corbel's voice and the sound of the harp, and played the CD for the film's director and Yamaha Music. As a result, Corbel was assigned to write the title song of the film. She was later asked to write more songs. By 2009, she was asked to compose the whole score.

Prior to its proclamation, the Central Council of Ukraine was elected in March 1917 as a result of the February Revolution, and in June, it declared Ukrainian autonomy within Russia. Its autonomy was later recognized by the Russian Provisional Government. Following the October Revolution, the Central Council of Ukraine denounced the Bolshevik seizure of power and proclaimed the Ukrainian People's Republic with a territory including the area of approximately eight Russian imperial governorates (Kiev, Volhynia, Kharkov, Kherson, Yekaterinoslav, Poltava, Chernigov and Podolia). It formally declared its independence from Russia on 22 January 1918.\nDuring its short existence, the republic went through several political transformations   from the socialist-leaning republic headed by the Central Council of Ukraine with its general secretariat, to the socialist republic led by the Directorate and by Symon Petliura. Between April and December 1918, the socialist authority of the Ukrainian People's Republic was suspended, having been overthrown by the pro-German Ukrainian State of Pavlo Skoropadskyi, who was elected as the Hetman of Ukraine by a congress of peasants. After the collapse of the Ukrainian State, the Ukrainian People's Republic declared its unification with the West Ukrainian People's Republic in January 1919.

After the Polish Ukrainian War, it signed an alliance with the Second Polish Republic. On 10 November 1920, the state lost the remainder of its territory to the Bolsheviks. The Peace of Riga on 18 March 1921 between Poland, Soviet Russia (acting also on behalf of Soviet Belarus), and Soviet Ukraine sealed the fate of the Ukrainian People's Republic.\nAfter the October Revolution, many governments formed in the territory of Ukraine, most notably the Ukrainian People's Republic of Soviets based in Kharkov, and its Soviet successors. This force, along with the Ukrainian People's Republic, the White movement, Poland, Green armies, and anarchists, fought constantly with each other, which resulted in many casualties among Ukrainians fighting in the Ukrainian War of Independence as part of the wider Russian Civil War of 1917 1923. Soviet Russia would extend its control over what would ultimately become the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, which became a founding member of the Soviet Union in 1922.\nHistory\nRevolutionary wave\nOn 10 June 1917, the Central Council of Ukraine declared its autonomy as part of the Russian Republic by its First Universal at the All-Ukrainian Military Congress.

At first Vynnychenko protested and left his post as Secretariat leader, but eventually returned to reassemble the Secretariat after the Tsentralna Rada accepted the Kerensky Instruktsiya and issued the Second Universal.\nAfter the October Revolution the Kievan faction of the Bolshevik Party instigated the uprising in Kiev on 8 November 1917 in order to establish Soviet power in the city. Kiev Military District forces attempted to stop it, but after the Tsentralna Rada threw its support behind the Bolsheviks, the Russian forces were eliminated from Kiev.

The Bolshevik Red Army entered Ukraine from the Russian SFSR in support of the local Soviet government. As the relationships between members within the Tsentralna Rada soured, a series of regional Soviet republics on the territory of Ukraine proclaimed their independence and allegiance to the Petrograd sovnarkom (Odesa Soviet Republic (southern Ukraine), Donetsk-Krivoi Rog Soviet Republic (eastern Ukraine)). The Donetsk-Kryvoi Rog Republic was created by a direct decree of Lenin as part of the Russian SFSR with its capital in Kharkov. That decree was successfully implemented by Fyodor Sergeyev who became the chairman of the local government as well as joining the Soviet government of Ukraine, simultaneously.

On 20 February 1918 the council of the Kuban People's Republic accepted the resolution for a federal union of Kuban with Ukraine as Bolshevik forces pushed towards Yekaterinodar. It was agreed to forward the resolution for ratification to the Ukrainian government.\nAfter the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Ukraine became a virtual protectorate of the German Empire which at that time seemed more favorable than being overrun by the Soviet forces that were spreading havoc in the country. Germany was anxious about losing the war and was trying to speed up the process of food extraction from Ukraine, so it decided to install its own administration in the person of Generalfeldmarschall von Eichhorn who replaced the Colonel General Alexander von Linsingen. On 6 April the commander of the Army group Kijew issued an order in which he explained his intentions to execute the conditions of the treaty. That, of course, conflicted with the laws of the Ukrainian government, which annulled his order.

The German Austro-Hungarian victories in Ukraine were due to the apathy of the locals and the inferior fighting skills of Bolsheviks troops compared to their Austro-Hungarian and German counterparts.\nThe Germans arrested and disbanded the Tsentralna Rada on 29 April 1918 to stop the social reforms that were taking place and restarted the process of food supply transfer to Germany and Austria-Hungary. The German authorities also arrested the Ukrainian Prime Minister, Vsevolod Holubovych, on terrorist charges, and thus disbanded the Council of People's Ministers. Prior to this, the Rada had approved the Constitution of the Ukrainian People's Republic. Concurrently with all these events and a few days prior to the change of powers in the country on 24 April 1918 the government of Belarus confirmed the Belarusian Chamber of Commerce in Kiev headed by Mitrofan Dovnar-Zapolsky on the initiative of the Belarusian secretary of finance Pyotr Krechevsky.\nHetmanate\nAfter the coup, the Rada was replaced by the conservative government of Hetman Pavlo Skoropadsky, the Hetmanate, and the Ukrainian People's Republic by a  Ukrainian State  (Ukrainska derzhava).

Skoropadsky, a former officer of the Russian Empire, established a regime favoring large landowners and concentrating power at the top. The government had little support from Ukrainian activists, but unlike the socialist Rada, it was able to establish an effective administrative organization, established diplomatic ties with many countries, and concluded a peace treaty with Soviet Russia. In a few months, the Hetmanate also printed millions of Ukrainian language textbooks, established many Ukrainian schools, two universities, and the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences.\nThe Hetmanate government also supported the confiscation of previously nationalized peasant lands by wealthy estate owners, often with the help of German troops. This led to unrest, the rise of a peasant partisan (guerrilla) movement, and a series of large-scale popular armed revolts. Negotiations were held to garner support from previous Rada members Petliura and Vynnychenko, but these activists worked to overthrow Skoropadsky. On 30 July, a Russian Left Socialist-Revolutionary, Boris Mikhailovich Donskoy, with help from the local USRP succeeded in assassinating von Eichhorn, blowing him up in downtown Kiev at a broadlight.\nDue to the impending loss of World War I by Germany and Austria-Hungary, Skoropadsky's sponsors, the Hetman formed a",

The subsequent Kiev offensive, staged by the Polish army and allied Ukrainian forces, was unable to change the situation.

Thus, they reached a line from Himara on the Ionian coast east to Prespa Lake. Pending the final decision of the following peace treaty, the region remained under Greek military control. On 17 December 1913, the Protocol of Florence ceded the northern part of Epirus to the newly established Principality of Albania. This turn of events catalysed an uprising among the local Greek population, who declared the independence of Northern Epirus. The Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus was thus proclaimed in Argyrokastro (Gjirokastër) on 28 February 1914, while a provisional government was formed under Georgios Christakis-Zografos.\nMeanwhile, serious disturbances broke out in a number of places between the Northern Epirote forces and Albanian gendarmerie units and irregulars. An International Commission of Control formed by the Great Powers to secure stability and peace in the region was unable to achieve an agreement between the two sides.\nProtocol of Corfu\nBy May 17, 1914, at a meeting held nearby in Corfu, Greece, representatives from both sides signed an agreement that would be known as Protocol of Corfu.

The latter claimed that the northern border of Northern Epirus should be drawn further north, including additional areas which, according to them, where once also part of historical Epirus. Additionally, some Epitore representatives claimed that they should negotiate for wider autonomy, while the Greek populations of Vlorë and Berat, which lay north of the claimed autonomist boundary, should also enjoy the same religious and educational rights.\nThe Greek government, without being involved until then in the situation, was aware of the negotiations and the possibility of a final agreement. Greek Prime Minister Venizelos urged Zografos to approve the protocol s terms as soon as possible without asking for even wider autonomy.

After the outbreak of World War I on July 28, 1914, the situation in Albania became unstable and political chaos ensued. When the country became split into a number of regional governments, Prince William departed the country in September 1914. On 27 October, after approval of the Great Powers, the Greek army re-entered Northern Epirus and the Provisional Government of Northern Epirus formally ceased to exist, declaring that it had accomplished its objectives. The region was de facto annexed to Greece until the second half of 1916, when Italian troops evicted the Greek army from the area. After the end of World War I it was finally ceded to the Principality of Albania.\nReferences\nSources\nBoeckh, Katrin (1996).

    "text": "Scream is a 1996 American slasher film directed by Wes Craven and written by Kevin Williamson. It stars David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, Matthew Lillard, Rose McGowan, Skeet Ulrich, and Drew Barrymore. Set in the fictional town of Woodsboro, California, the plot follows high school student Sidney Prescott (Campbell) and her friends, who, on the anniversary of her mother's murder, become the targets of a costumed serial killer.\nWilliamson, who was struggling to get his projects off the ground, was inspired by reports of a series of murders by the Gainesville Ripper as he wrote a screenplay that satirized the clichés of the slasher genre popularized in films such as Halloween (1978), Friday the 13th (1980), and Craven's own A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984). Developed under the title Scary Movie, Williamson's script became the subject of an intense bidding war from multiple studios before Miramax Films purchased the rights for its Dimension Films label. Craven, despite turning down the opportunity multiple times, agreed to direct the film after he had read the script as he was determined to re-establish himself after several career setbacks. The involvement of Barrymore and Cox helped secure more support from the studio. Principal photography took place from April to June 1996 in California on a budget of  15 million.

Principal photography took place from April to June 1996 in California on a budget of  15 million. Craven trimmed down the violence in the film after being involved in a tense conflict with the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) over the desired R rating.\nReleased on December 20, Scream was not expected to perform well due to concerns over releasing a slasher film in a time normally reserved for holiday entertainment. However, it went on to gross approximately  173 million worldwide through the strength of word of mouth, becoming an unexpected success and one of the highest-grossing films of the year. Contemporary reviews were positive, with praise going to the performances of its cast and its unique meta humor, but criticism was directed at its excessive violence and lack of suspense in favor of that humor. Scream revitalized both Craven's and Barrymore's careers and helped bolster the careers of its young cast.\nIn the years since its release, Scream's reception has continued to be positive. It has been credited with rekindling interest in the horror genre during the 1990s following a decline in the genre's popularity and has been credited for shifting the genre towards younger audiences and casting established actors.

While house-sitting, Williamson watched a Turning Point documentary about serial killer Danny Rolling which he said left him unsettled. Williamson later noticed an open window, armed himself with a knife, and called his friend for support. The pair began discussing horror characters that had resonated with them such as Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees. The following morning, Williamson was woken by a nightmare and used the experience as inspiration for the opening home invasion of Scream. He was also influenced by a one-act play he wrote in college about an unknown caller taunting a young girl.\nWilliamson spent the next three days writing a script for a slasher film he called Scary Movie while listening to the score to Halloween for further inspiration. He also drafted two five-page outlines for possible sequels. He developed much of the script around a single line of dialogue,  movies don't create psychos, movies make psychos more creative . This was his response to contemporary concerns about the influence of cinematic violence on audience, and he  thought it was a great line .

At the time, the successful slasher films of the 1970s and 1980s had fallen out of favor, in part because of increasingly poorly received sequels to long-running horror franchises.\nHis characters were intentionally designed to be knowledgeable about these horror films and their typical elements, with the intention of creating a unique killer who was not only aware of horror film clichés but also exploited them for his own advantage. Williamson expressed his approach,  I thought if you could expose the rules and play with them, then the audience doesn't know what they're going to get. Suddenly they're on edge. I started playing with the tropes, and the 'rules' were part of that.  The opening scene depicting Casey Becker's death emulates that of Janet Leigh's character in Psycho (1960) by killing off a possible main character early on. Williamson believed it would hook studio executives and leave audiences unsure how the plot would progress. Williamson set the script in his hometown of Bayboro, North Carolina, believing its quiet atmosphere would provide a strong contrast with a serial killer's actions.\nWilliamson pursued Scary Movie because it was the type of horror film he enjoyed as a child but believed were no longer being made.

Williamson's agent had him scale back the gore, removing descriptions such as  the insides are slowly rolling down her leg , because it would make it difficult to sell the script. Williamson refused to cut any dialogue, however, believing it set it apart from similar films.\nDevelopment\nBy 1995, there was competition to secure the rights to Scary Movie, with early interest expressed by Morgan Creek Entertainment, Paramount Pictures, Universal Pictures, and filmmaker Oliver Stone. The script came to the attention of producer Cathy Konrad of Woods Entertainment, which had a development deal with production studio Miramax Films. She brought it to Richard Potter, the director of development for Miramax Films' genre-film-focused subsidiary Dimension Films. Potter expected a  stupid spoof  but was drawn in by the opening scene and recommended Miramax Films chairman, Bob Weinstein, pursue the rights. He agreed, considering it an opportunity to produce films instead of distributing those of others. Although others offered larger figures, Williamson's lawyer advised him take Weinstein's offer ( 400,000  500,000) because Dimension Films was willing to make the film immediately.\nWilliamson revised",

This solved a separate difficulty Williamson was having explaining why all but the core group of characters leave Stu's party in the finale, as they go to see Himbry's corpse. The Scary Movie title was also changed to Scream late in production because Weinstein was concerned Scary Movie would lead audiences to believe it was a comedy instead of a horror.\nThe search for a director was protracted, with Danny Boyle, Tom McLoughlin, Sam Raimi, George A. Romero, Bryan Singer, Quentin Tarantino, Robert Rodriguez, and Anthony Waller being considered. No agreements were secured because those approached for the role interpreted the script as a comedy instead of a horror satire.

His interest was renewed after The Haunting of Hill House adaptation was cancelled and he experienced the personal disappointment of his failed horror comedy, Vampire in Brooklyn (1995). After reading the script, Plec said Craven suggested the studio  'make him an offer he can't refuse.' And so Dimension did. And he took it.  The deal also offered Craven his choice of other projects to direct after Scream.\nWilliamson met Craven to discuss the script, believing he would request substantial rewrites, but Craven's notes related mainly to typos and some minor additions including restoring some of the gorier content and refining the ending which was not yet fully realized. Williamson said  The story stayed pretty much intact, but we added some scares, and shortened it.

But that suddenly starts happening in their actual lives. \nCasting\nAtypical for the genre at the time, Scream featured a cast of established stars, such as Drew Barrymore and Courteney Cox, as well as relatively unknown actors. Executive producer Cary Woods used his friendship with Barrymore's agent to cast her in the lead role of Sidney Prescott, but she later requested the smaller role of Casey Becker. Maddalena suggested that Barrymore had wanted to leave the project entirely, but took the smaller role to avoid disappointing Bob Weinstein and his brother Harvey. The filmmakers agreed to the change, believing it would be impactful to kill off their most well-known actor during Scream's opening and convince audiences that no character was safe. Vinessa Shaw and Reese Witherspoon were also considered for Sidney Prescott.

Describing what attracted her to the role, Campbell said Sidney was  a fantastic character for any kind of movie  who transitions from  tormented, traumatized, insecure young woman to overwhelmingly empowered and strong .\nWoods suggested Courteney Cox for the cold and calculating Gale Weathers, believing it would be interesting to play against her typical personable characters in series such as Family Ties (1982 1989) and Friends (1994 2004). Craven did not believe Cox could play the part and so she wrote a letter assuring him that  being 'a bitch' wouldn't be a stretch at all .

As a result, McGowan had to reaudition for the role twice. McGowan influenced Tatum's design, dying her hair blonde to avoid having two dark-haired main female characters, removing an Indigo Girls poster from Tatum's bedroom (because she would not listen to the relatively older band), and rejecting costuming suggestions in favor of her self-bought outfits.

To develop his character, Ulrich researched serial murders, psychological profiles, and outfitted one of his hotel rooms to the Billy persona to help him get into character, outfitting it with punk rock posters and blacklights. He said,  I was into punk music in my teens and really just trying to recapture that angst ...

Production designer Bruce Miller explained that it was important to portray the characters as vulnerable in their homes which made it essential that they could film inside and outside the properties. Scouts researched locations in the United States and Canada but struggled to locate a house for the opening scene which featured plentiful windows and visibility. Craven initially researched Wilmington, North Carolina but it failed to meet his expectations:  I wanted to have very American looking houses ... and a lot of the houses there were very dark brown, or brick, and that didn't look attractive to me.  Locations near Vancouver were discounted for similar reasons, as was Napa County, California.\nSanta Rosa in Sonoma County, California offered most features the filmmakers required, but the Weinsteins rejected the additional  1 to 2 million required to film there until the filmmakers convinced them that Craven's name would attract enough audiences to compensate for the added cost.

The Healdsburg, California town square appears as the location of the Woodsboro Town Square, the fountain, and the exterior of the town police station.\nStu's home was an unoccupied property in Tomales which offered a dark and isolated atmosphere for the finale. Cinematographer Mark Irwin unsuccessfully argued against using the property because it was on top of a hill, introducing logistical challenges for accessing trailers and equipment. Miller built a facade of barns in front of the house so trailers could be sited closer while remaining concealed. The art department extensively modified the house, adding Gothic elements such as beams and stained-glass windows to give it a haunted feel, painting the walls red (although they realized later this made the blood stand out less), and adding a white picket fence.

Ten days of filming were to take place there in early June at a cost of  30,000 to 50,000, but permission was revoked in March 1996 by the Santa Rosa school district. The change was ostensibly because of the disruption filming would cause during school hours and scheduled exams, but several school board members objected to the violent content in the script, and hundreds of locals attended a council meeting to debate against and for the production; the board ultimately voted against allowing filming.\nThe Sonoma Community Center served as a replacement filming location, but scenes had to be rewritten to accommodate the new location and additional costs to transform the former elementary school into one appropriate for young adults, including larger desks and installing lockers. Craven estimated the disruption and location changes caused by the Santa Rosa district's decision cost the production  350,000, including the  27,000 the center was paid for three days of filming.

Special effects company KNB EFX Group was commissioned to design a mask, but the filmmakers disliked their  gargoyle-ish , witch, and goblin-like masks designs. While location scouting a house, Maddalena came across what would become the Ghostface mask. This mask, featuring a white shroud, was designed by Brigitte Sleiertin as  the Peanut-Eyed Ghost  for the novelty company Fun World in 1991, based on a design by makeup artist Loren Gitthens. However, Craven and the studio wanted to own the design used in the film and tasked KNB EFX with creating a similar but legally distinct design, stretching the nose and chin. Unhappy with the results, Craven eventually decided to pursue the original Fun World design.

So just having the voice to react to made it larger in their minds .\nFor safety, stunt performers portrayed the killer in costume, although Craven portrays the killer in parts of the opening. The first few days of filming used a custom mask designed for Scream, but Craven did not like it and reshot various scenes with the Fun World design before it was licensed. Because the hung Casey was to appear gutted from chest to waist, effects artist Howard Berger decided against applying prosthetics to Barrymore in favor of a mannequin that could be hollowed out, showing her spine holding her upper and lower parts together.

He was critical of the Fun World Mask believing it was  flat  and not scary and ordered that the opening scene be re-filmed with alternative masks to see which worked best.

Scream was filmed with an anamorphic lens, which distorts and stretches the image to achieve a specific aspect ratio. However, neither Craven nor Irwin had much experience with this type of lens.

By the time they had filmed Gale returning with a gun, Ulrich said he and Lillard were  roaming around like caged animals  to keep the intensity of their performances high, to the point Craven asked them to relax because they were scaring Cox. Lillard described maintaining that level of adrenaline as exhausting. Campbell, Kennedy, Lillard, and Ulrich endured multiple nights covered in fake blood, and the costumes could not be washed to maintain continuity (they were dampened each night to make the blood appear fresh). When Ulrich stabs a sofa, the filmmakers were unaware it was stuffed with feathers which stuck to the fake blood; Maddalena considered Craven  nuts  for keeping the feathers in the scene. Lillard improvised lines such as  My mom and dad are going to be so mad at me  and  You fucking hit me with the phone, you dick , the latter taking place when Ulrich threw a phone near him as intended but the sticky blood caused it to veer off and inadvertently hit Lillard. Ulrich suggested Billy cracking his neck before shooting Gale, and the sound was added in post-production. Campbell's stuntwoman accidentally stabbed Ulrich with an umbrella tip, missing the protective vest he was wearing and hitting the site of an open heart surgery Ulrich had as a child.\nFilming concluded on June 14, 1996.

The main cast and select crew members, including Craven, often gathered together in the early mornings after filming for meals, activities, and socializing. Arquette's hotel room was transformed into a makeshift club where they would congregate. However, due to complaints from other residents, they eventually relocated their early morning gatherings to a nearby barn.\nPost-production\nThe Scary Movie title remained late into production, appearing on the cast and crew gifts for completing filming. Harvey Weinstein suggested Scream based on the Michael and Janet Jackson song  Scream . Many of the cast and crew were initially unhappy with the change. Sony Pictures filed a lawsuit against Dimension and Miramax, claiming Scream infringed on their copyright of Screamers (1995). The case was settled out of court with Dimension being able to use Scream going forward. Although Arquette's and Kennedy's characters were killed in the script, alternate scenes were filmed showing them survive in case they proved popular with test screening audiences.

The successful screenings also resulted in Miramax asking Craven to direct two Scream sequels.\nScream was rated NC-17 by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), restricting its audience to those over 17 years of age, which was considered  box-office suicide  by industry experts. The MPAA told Craven that Scream would never receive a more commercial R-rating, allowing younger people to see the film when accompanied by an adult. Craven said,  I'm a director who can do something very well but am not allowed to put it on screen. And they ultimately get you, as they did on this one, on intensity. They say, 'it's not a specific shot, it's not blood, it's just too intense' . The filmmakers eventually convinced the MPAA that Scream was a spoof, believing they were too focused on the horror aspects.\nIt took up to nine cuts to address the MPAA's complaints, including removing any movement of Steve Orth's internal organs, trimming Kenny's throat being slit (because the actor's pained expression was too  disturbing ), moving Billy and Stu stabbing each other off screen, and reducing scenes of Casey's hanging body and Tatum's crushed head.

Craven gave Beltrami a weekend to compose  The Cue from Hell , the score for the film's opening sequence, which secured his hiring. Beltrami wrote the piece from Casey's perspective and used an  operatic  style, employing a range of instruments, including piano and brass. Beltrami described himself as  bumbling  through the scoring process, acknowledging his limited knowledge of horror music styles. He incorporated elements of the western genre, particularly for Dewey's theme, and took cues from composers including Elliot Goldenthal, Ennio Morricone, Eric Serra, Christopher Young, and Hans Zimmer.\nDue to budget constraints, Beltrami had to work with a small orchestra of fewer than 50 performers. To compensate for the lack of string harmonics, he instructed the string players to whistle, and asked Craven, Lussier, Maddalena, and Woods to join and boost their numbers.

Bob Weinstein opted to release Scream in December as counterprogramming, offering teenagers an alternative to more traditional holiday fare. The decision was unpopular with the cast and crew, with Williamson expecting the film to fail. Weinstein explained,  people said we were crazy to put out Scream over Christmas ...

During a promotional interview, Ulrich inadvertently revealed he portrayed one of the killers and called his agent to get the story blocked.\nBox office\nThe premiere of Scream took place on December 18, 1996, at the AVCO theater in Westwood, Los Angeles. It was released in the United States and Canada on December 20. During its opening weekend, the film grossed  6.4 million across 1,413 theaters an average of  4,497 per theater making it the fourth-highest-grossing film of the weekend, behind 101 Dalmatians ( 7 million), Jerry Maguire ( 13.1 million), and the debut of Beavis and Butt-Head Do America ( 20.1 million).

However, Scream received positive audience word-of-mouth and exit-polling responses, leading the studio to increase the marketing and distribution budget. This contributed to Scream's performance improving in the following weeks. Although it fell to fifth place in its second weekend, it increased its weekend gross to  9.1 million, and again in its third weekend, rising to third place with  10 million. Scream remained in the top-ten-highest-grossing films for nine weeks in total, becoming a surprise success and grossing a total of  103 million. This figure made it the number 13 highest-grossing film of 1996, and highest-grossing slasher film of its time, until Halloween (2018). It was Miramax's second film to gross  100 million in the United States and Canada after Pulp Fiction (1994). The film was most successful with teenagers and young people in their 20s.\nOutside of the U.S. and Canada, Scream is estimated to have grossed a further  70 million, including  14 million in the United Kingdom, making it the number 21 highest-grossing film.

In Japan, the release date was postponed from May 1997 to August after the murder of a 14-year-old boy, whose killer was apparently obsessed with horror movies.\nIndustry analysis showed that most of the films released toward the end of the year were box office failures, including both big-budget fare and a surge of films targeted toward women. Only a few were seen as successes, including 101 Dalmatians, Beavis and Butt-Head Do America, Jerry Maguire, Ransom, Scream, and Star Trek: First Contact.

Some critics said that the film's intelligence and wit beneath the gore would be appreciated by  sophisticated viewers , but Ebert was unsure if the degree of violence was  defused by the ironic way the film uses it and comments on it .\nJanet Maslin wrote that while Scream offered original ideas for the genre, it quickly exhausted them. John Hartl offered a similar sentiment, believing Scream was so focused on referencing other films that it did not know when to  settle down to tell a coherent story . Bill Stamets considered these references insightful, particularly the killers' motives, saying  Killers without motives are far more scary. \nCritics such as Berardinelli, Thomas, and Leonard Klady wrote positively of the ensemble cast and their instrumentality in the film's success.

The debut of Scream coincided with growing discourse in the United States on the impact of on-screen violence and its potential consequences for society. During this time, the Clinton administration introduced the V-chip, a device designed to enable parents to block mature television content. However, news programs remained exempt from the ratings system, which Delgado said continued to  exploit  violent incidents to captivate audiences. Gale portrays a relentless television reporter who used Maureen's murder to further her own career and seeks to do the same with the Woodsboro murders. Although Gale advocates for the innocence of Cotton Weary in Maureen's death, she does so both because she believes he is innocent and to secure a lucrative book deal. While Gale's actions revolve around profiting from the suffering of others, she is depicted not as a villain but a careerist and an antagonist to Sidney who evolves into a heroic figure, aiding in the deaths of Billy and Stu. Gardener wrote that making a living from murder is not morally equal to committing murder, but that it represents the commodification of crime and female trauma.

He compared it to contemporary sensationalized cases such as the Murder trial of O. J. Simpson, Lorena Bobbit's assault of her husband, the Long Island Lolita case, and the Gainesville Ripper. The Ripper's defence included his assertion of being influenced by films such as The Exorcist III (1990). Despite public concerns about the influence of violent media, instances of violent crime were decreasing when Scream was released and there remained no direct link between violent media content and real-life crimes. Even so, public fascination with these media portrayals created a form of celebrity for the victims or perpetrators, with dramatic events being turned into documentaries and films. In Scream, Sidney jokes that a film will be made about the traumatic events of her life and, in the sequels, the film-within-a-film Stab horror series is created, based partly on the events of each preceding Scream entry.\nAnalysis\nAuthor Padraic Maroney wrote that Scream was pro-feminism, depicting several final girls who fight the killer instead of submitting.

The success of Scream demonstrated to studios that although typically seen as fare for young males, horror films had an untapped female market. Writer Aime Simon said Sidney, like Craven's Nancy Thompson, is allowed to develop as a character by surviving successive films. The Scream films often explore female trauma through characters such as Sidney and Gale, including the dangers posed by angry males who feel rejected. Gardener said that although this may not have been Craven's intention, the film's narrative effectively conveys this theme. She continued that the male killers in Scream enact violence and intimidation primarily on women, including Casey who romantically rejects Stu before the events of the film, and Sidney's mother Maureen, as Billy blames her for the end of his parents' marriage. Maureen is not responsible for his mother leaving, but Billy blames her, takes his anger out on her directly, and then abuses Sidney's emotional vulnerability caused by her death. In this way, the portrayal of Billy and Stu as angry entitled men seeking revenge is more relatable and realistic than supernatural horror villains.\nScream has been analyzed for homosexual or queer undertones, influenced by Williamson's own experiences as a gay man.

Subconsciously, I think the Scream movies are coded in gay survival.  Several publications have highlighted the positive response from gay fans of the franchise to these underlying themes.\nSome writers, such as Maroney, Brant Lewis, and Joe Lipsett, have discussed the theory that Billy and Stu are in a homosexual relationship or that Stu held unrequited feelings for Billy. Professor David Greven wrote that Billy and Stu are representative of the changing notions of masculinity and the underlying currents of queer desire in 90s films. The interactions between them throughout the movie contain themes of homoeroticism, such as when Stu playfully touches Randy's earlobe or leans on Billy during the climax before they stab each other with phallic weapons. Greven believed that although it is easy to assign homosexuality to Stu because of his lack of motive to kill and apparent willingness to please his friend, Billy also features homoerotic characteristics such as the gay trope of fixating on his maternal relationship, similar to Norman Bates in Psycho, and Billy's visual styling resembling actor James",

It is credited with revitalizing the horror genre, which had significantly declined in popularity by the early 1990s. Far Out and MTV described Scream as a  ground-breaking  slasher film that  successfully crossed over into the mainstream  because of its deft blend of traditional horror with self-aware commentary and satire. Vox wrote that Scream  mainstreamed metatextual storytelling and made that analytical understanding of the genre mainstream in a lot of ways .\nStudios rushed to capitalize on Scream's success with teen-centric horror films and television series leading into the 2000s, such as I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997), Urban Legend, The Faculty (both 1998",

Scream also serves as the subject of the parody film Scary Movie (2000), which in turn launched its own franchise of horror spoofs. Director Jordan Peele has credited Scream as a direct inspiration for his own influential horror film, Get Out (2017), in manipulating the audience's expectations of the contemporary horror genre.\nScream helped launch or bolster the careers of its principal stars, including Campbell, Ulrich, Lillard, McGowan, Kennedy, and Arquette. Williamson became an in-demand screenwriter, contributing to horror films such as I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997) and television series Dawson's Creek (1998 2003). Scream helped revitalize Craven's career after several career setbacks and a string of poor performances.

The Billy and Stu version of Ghostface (voiced by Jackson) appears as a playable character in the fighting game Mortal Kombat 1 (2023). As of 2021, Lillard's improvised dialogue,  My mom and dad are gonna be so mad at me , was still quoted to him by fans.\nIn the years since its release, Scream was cited as an influence in several violent crimes and murders, with perpetrators sometimes dressing as Ghostface, as in the 2006 murder of Cassie Jo Stoddart.

The use of Caller ID to identify incoming callers also increased by 300  following Scream's release.\nRetrospective assessments\nScream is regarded as a classic of the horror genre, and among the greatest horror and slasher films ever made. Several publications have also listed it among the best films of the 1990s. Williamson believed Scream's success was due, in part, to fitting the contemporary zeitgeist when  everyone wanted to have scary and fun in their life ... If the movie had been released at any other time, I'm not sure that would've been the case . Campbell believed it connected with audiences because of a deft combination of humor, horror, and intelligence.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 77  from the aggregated reviews of 122 critics, with an average score of 7.1 10. The consensus reads:  Horror icon Wes Craven's subversive deconstruction of the genre is sly, witty, and surprisingly effective as a slasher film itself, even if it's a little too cheeky for some . The film has a score of 66 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 25 critics, indicating  generally favorable reviews . The British Film Institute (BFI) called the opening scene  one of the all-time great pre-credit scenes an unforgettable masterclass of building tension, heart-stopping terror, and shocking images .

Scream 2 (1997) achieved similar financial and critical success as Scream. Williamson was unavailable to write Scream 3 (2000), the trilogy's concluding chapter, and was replaced with Ehren Kruger. The film fared less well than its predecessors, commercially and critically, and is regarded as the franchise's most divisive entry. Williamson returned to the series with the reboot film Scream 4 (2011). While Scream 4 has been positively reassessed since its release, its modest box office and critical reception on its release, as well as Craven's death, placed the franchise on hold.\nA television adaptation, Scream (2015 2019), ran for three seasons. The Weinsteins refused to license the Fun World costume for the show or allow references to the films, which was controversial with fans and contributed to the series' low ratings, poor reception, and eventual cancellation.\nThe film series was relaunched with Scream (2022), and its success led to immediate development of a sixth installment, Scream VI (2023).

Covering an area of 1,373 ha (3,390 acres) and a maximum depth of 135 m (443 ft), the lake is located in the Lake Sumner Forest Park and on the main stem of the Hurunui River. Several other lakes such as Loch Katrine, Lake Sheppard, Lake Taylor and Lake Mason also lie within the park.\nThe Lake Sumner region is a popular area for hunting, tramping, trout fishing, whitewater kayaking and mountain biking. Several Department of Conservation tramping huts in the region make it a common destination for overnight trips; however, the area's comparatively remote location and difficult vehicle access mean it is seldom crowded.\nHoka Kura is a cold inland oligotrophic lake formed approximately 18,000 years ago.

The Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) conducted a raid and discovered that Valtoha's property was illegally drawing power. The sanctioned load was 4.85 kW, but the actual consumption was 11 kW, with unauthorized connections bypassing the meter. Additionally, the team found wires connected directly from a transformer, indicating deliberate power theft.\nClaiming B. R. Ambedkar Fanned Casteism\nDuring a TV discussion in 2016, Valtoha accused Dr. B. R. Ambedkar of promoting casteism by advocating reservations. This remark drew sharp backlash from the AAP, which demanded legal action and later saw public protests in Tarn Taran, including effigy burning.\nThreats to Officials - Video Goes Viral\nIn 2017, a video circulated showing Valtoha allegedly threatening Tarn Taran s Deputy Commissioner (DC) and police officers. He warned them against harassing Akali workers, stating he had taken note of names and would act accordingly.

This, to the extent that beyond the economic advantages mentioned by the Multinational, there were deep disagreements highlighted by various environmentalists, led by citizen Renzo García, the carnival marcha creator, who stated that in their opinion, the generation of environmental liabilities, the contamination and the destruction of the territory would not have any equivalent in the presumed advantages used by the company.

Dennis worked closely with both Bob Moses and Medgar Evers as well as with members of SNCC, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. His first involvement in the Civil Rights Movement was at a Woolworth sit-in organized by CORE and he went on to become a Freedom Rider in 1961. Since 1989, Dennis has put his activism toward the Algebra Project, a nonprofit organization run by Bob Moses that aims to improve mathematics education for minority children. Dennis also speaks publicly about his experiences in the movement through an organization called Dave Dennis Connections.\nEarly life\nDave Dennis was born in 1940 on a plantation of a sharecropper in Omega, Louisiana. All he knew was a life of segregation, he says in one interview with Ebony magazine,  I grew up in this life where you had to stay in your place.

It takes the name from the hamlet of Bluesky, and was first described in Shell's Bluesky No. 1 well by Badgley in 1952.\nLithology and Depositional Environment\nThe formation is composed of mudstones, conglomerates and sandstones which can be quartzose or contain chert grains. Many of the Bluesky sandstones do not display bedding features although some low and moderate-angle large scale cross-bedding has been observed in some sections. The sediments were deposited in both marginally marine nearshore and fully marine offshore settings following a transgression of the ancient Moosebar Sea. Bluesky sediments are separated from Gething strata by a scoured or loaded contact and occasionally by a burrowed Glossifungites surface. The Bluesky Formation can be very porous and produces hydrocarbons in many areas across Western Canada. Heavy oil is produced from the Bluesky formation in the Peace River area.\nDistribution\nThe Bluesky Formation reaches a thickness of 46 meters (151 ft) in the Pouce Coupe area, and thins out toward north and west. Thin sands can be found in the Peace River area.\nRelationship with other units\nAlthough some early workers included the Bluesky Formation in the Bullhead Group, it is usually classified as the basal unit of the Fort St. John Group.

It is conformably overlain by the Wilrich Member of the Spirit River Formation and conformably underlain by the Gething Formation. Northeast of the town of Peace River it was deposited unconformably on Mississippian limestone. It is equivalent with the Glauconitic Sandstone of the Mannville Group in central and southern Alberta, as well as with the Wabiskaw Member of the Clearwater Formation in the eastern part of northern Alberta.\nBitumen Deposits\nThe Bluesky deposit of bitumen comes from the  clean estuarine reservoir sands of the Cretaceous-age Bluesky Formation  in the Peace River. Secondary production area is the Gething Formation. The combined Bluesky-Gething deposit is the primary target area for oil sands development in the Peace River area. There is a reservoir at about 600 m (2,000 ft) 700 m (2,300 ft) below the surface. Heavy oil in the Peace River, produced from bitumen deposit is extracted using wells not by mining.\nThe oil sands of the Bluesky-Gething were deposited during the Cretaceous Period within a transgressive system, with the lower fluvial to nonmarine Gething Formation at the base and the estuarine Bluesky Formation at the top. Deposition of the Bluesky-Gething reservoir and nonreservoir units was controlled by topography of the pre-Cretaceous unconformity. The Red Earth Highlands separate the Bluesky-Gething into northeast and southwest accumulations and includes part of the Seal Lake area.

The language is spoken by an estimated 800,000 people. \nSepulana is classified within the Bantu language family, specifically as part of the Sotho-Tswana group, and is considered an Eastern Sotho language, alongside Pai and Kutswe. Historically, Sepulana has been incorrectly regarded as a dialect of Northern Sotho (Sesotho sa Leboa) or Sepedi, a perception stemming from its geographical proximity to the Bapedi people, despite clear linguistic distinctions. This historical miscategorisation has implications for its current status. Sepulana exists predominantly in an unwritten form and is not formally taught in schools. Despite its non-official status, significant community-led efforts are underway for its documentation, revitalisation, and official recognition.\nLinguistic classification\nSepulana's linguistic classification places it firmly within the broader Bantu language family. It belongs to the Sotho-Tswana group, which corresponds to the S.30 label in Guthrie's 1967 71 classification of Bantu languages. This group encompasses closely related languages such as Setswana, Northern Sotho, Southern Sotho, and Lozi.\nWithin the Sotho",

This group encompasses closely related languages such as Setswana, Northern Sotho, Southern Sotho, and Lozi.\nWithin the Sotho-Tswana group, linguists classify Sepulana as part of the Eastern Sotho varieties, alongside Pai and Kutswe. These Eastern Sotho varieties are often considered more divergent from the core Northern Sotho dialects. Maho (2002) notably left the  East Sotho  varieties of Kutswe, Pai, and Pulana unclassified within Sotho-Tswana, further emphasizing their distinctiveness from other Sotho-Tswana languages.\nA significant aspect of Sepulana's linguistic identity is its distinction from Northern Sotho and Sepedi. While it shares some similarities with Sepedi (Northern Sotho), Sepulana is explicitly stated not to be a dialect of Sepedi (Sesotho Sa Leboa). Northern Sotho functions as an umbrella term for a collection of related dialects, with Sepedi being the specific dialect spoken by the Pedi people. The written form of Northern Sotho was largely based on the Sepedi dialect, developed by missionaries in 1860. This historical standardisation process led to  Sepedi  being used as a broader term for the entire language family, even though it is technically just one dialect. \nThe historical classification of",

This historical standardisation process led to  Sepedi  being used as a broader term for the entire language family, even though it is technically just one dialect. \nThe historical classification of Sepulana as a mere dialect, particularly during the apartheid era, was a political decision rather than a purely linguistic one, contributing to ongoing debates about its status. This historical imposition has fueled the Mapulana people's ongoing efforts to gain recognition for their language as a sovereign official tongue. The Pan South African Language Board (PanSALB) conducted a survey in 2017 to address the controversy surrounding the names Sepedi and Sesotho sa Leboa, finding that a majority of respondents preferred Sesotho sa Leboa, indicating a broader dissatisfaction with the imposed Sepedi label. This situation underscores the complex interplay between linguistic classification, historical power dynamics, and cultural identity in South Africa.\nGeographic distribution and demographics\nSepulana is primarily spoken in the Bushbuckridge area, a low-veld region situated near the border of Mpumalanga and Limpopo provinces in South Africa. This area is also known as Mapulaneng, a name that holds deep cultural significance as it directly translates from the Sepulana language to mean  Place of the Mapulana people .

This direct linguistic link between the place name  Mapulaneng  and the  Mapulana people  and their language  Sepulana  signifies a profound, inherent connection between the community, their ancestral land, and their linguistic identity. The town of Bushbuckridge itself originated around a trading store established in 1884 and was named for the abundant bushbuck herds and a prominent ridge in the 1880s. \nThe Mapulana people are a distinct ethnic group, and their language, Sepulana, is a central component of their cultural identity. The estimated number of native Sepulana speakers is approximately 800,000. The Bushbuckridge Local Municipality serves as the administrative center for this region, which is home to a significant population of Mapulana speakers. The substantial number of speakers, coupled with the language's non-official status, highlights a notable discrepancy in formal recognition for this linguistic community.\nCurrent status and influences\nSepulana currently exists predominantly in an unwritten form and is not taught in schools.

These influences include neighboring indigenous languages such as Swati and Xitsonga (Tsonga). The oral history of the Mapulana people also recounts historical conflicts with Swazis and Shangaans, indicating long-standing interactions that would naturally lead to linguistic exchange. More dominant South African languages, including English and Afrikaans, have also exerted influence. Furthermore, other Sotho-Tswana languages like Sepedi, Setswana, and Southern Sotho (Sesotho) have made inroads into Sepulana. Children in the region often acquire English, Afrikaans, and Sepedi at school, while migrant workers returning home introduce words and phrases from Setswana, Sesotho, and Afrikaans. \nDespite these influences and the pervasive presence of other languages, Sepulana has retained its unique vocabulary and linguistic features, distinguishing it from other Sotho languages. However, the absence of a standardized written form and formal education, coupled with the pervasive influence of other languages and the active discouragement of Sepulana in educational settings, collectively pose a significant threat to the language's vitality.

Studies indicate that the use of Sepulana by first-language speakers can negatively impact their learning of Sepedi, the standardised language taught in schools. Subject advisors have actively discouraged the use of Sepulana in classrooms, asserting that only Sepedi, as the official language, should be used, and often dismissing Sepulana as  not a language but a dialect . This perspective has been criticized for its bias and for disregarding the principle that all language varieties can be promoted and developed. Within the Mapulana community, some sub-dialects, such as HiPaye (spoken by the Mambayi subgroup), are facing extinction, with very few speakers remaining. This decline reflects the broader challenges to language transmission and survival.\nOrthography and phonology\nCurrently, Sepulana exists primarily in an unwritten form, meaning there is no widely adopted or standardized writing system for the language. The existing written form for Northern Sotho, with which Sepulana is sometimes erroneously associated, was standardized using the Latin alphabet. This orthography was developed by missionaries in 1860, largely based on the Sepedi dialect, and employs specific conventions for sounds, such as 'š' for the  ʃ  sound and circumflex accents to distinguish certain vowel sounds.\nIn response to the need for a more linguistically efficient writing system for highly agglutinative",

The emergence of Ditema tsa Dinoko, an ideographic writing system specifically designed for Eastern Sotho languages such as Sepulana, represents a proactive, community-aligned initiative to address the historical absence of a written form for these languages. This system aims to remedy the  slowness in reading  often associated with the numerous multigraphs used in Latin scripts for these languages. Ditema tsa Dinoko is characterized as a syllabary, where individual graphemes representing consonants, vowels, and featural elements are combined into syllabic blocks known as amabheqe. The positioning of consonant graphemes within this system often corresponds to their place of articulation (e.g., labials at the apex, alveolars across the middle). It also incorporates specific markers for articulatory mode, such as Uphimbo (a voicing line), Lerothodi (a glottal action dot), and Ingungwana (a nasalization marker). \nLike other Bantu languages, Sepulana",

Bantu languages typically feature complex noun class and concord systems. Northern Sotho, for instance, is a non-articled language. Academic studies on the core vocabulary and morphological structures, such as compound words, in Sepedi provide insights into the grammatical characteristics shared across related Sotho-Tswana languages.\nDocumentation and revitalization efforts\nSignificant community-led initiatives and partnerships are actively engaged in documenting, preserving, and promoting the Sepulana language, aiming to counteract its historical marginalization.\nA pivotal organization in these efforts is the Mapulaneng Writers' Association (MWA). The MWA serves as an advocacy and lobby group dedicated to Mapulana culture, history, and language. In a notable step towards establishing a written literary tradition for Sepulana, the MWA introduced and launched six newly published novels written in the language in 2019.

This project's primary goal is the oral Bible translation and transcription of the New Testament into Sepulana. Phase 1 of the project successfully completed the oral Bible translation of 40 narratives from both the Old and New Testaments, as well as an oral and written translation of the Gospel of Mark.

Song-writing workshops have been organised with the Mapulana community to create worship songs based on the translated scriptures, thereby integrating the language with cultural and religious practices. These initiatives align with broader language preservation strategies that emphasize community-based programs, cultural events, and the integration of traditional knowledge with language learning. The multi-faceted approach to Sepulana revitalisation, encompassing literary publications, religious translations, and political lobbying, demonstrates a comprehensive and strategic community-led effort to secure the language's future and counteract historical marginalisation. The ultimate aim is to empower indigenous communities to lead their own revitalisation efforts, potentially leveraging technological advancements such as app development to teach younger generations.\nCultural context of the Mapulana people\nThe Sepulana language is inextricably linked to the rich cultural heritage and history of the Mapulana people.

The Mapulana (or Pulana) are a low-veld ethnic group whose name is believed to be derived from their founding leader, Lepulana, who later adopted the name Chiloane. Their historical origins can be traced back to the Kgalagadi, from where they settled in Thaba Chueu, in what is now eastern Lesotho, and Shakwaneng (Carolina) during the 1500s.\nResearch indicates that the Mapulana people comprise three main ancestral groups: the Mapulana of Mohlomi, who are of Bakwena origin; the Mapulana of Matshwe I, of Pulane, who are of Amazizi (Nguni) origin and previously resided along the Tugela River before joining other Mapulana at Thaba Chueu; and the Mapulana of Chiloane, who are of Barolong (Setswana) origin and separated from the main Barolong tribe during the reign of Tau. This diverse ancestry suggests a complex historical tapestry and potential linguistic influences from various Sotho-Tswana and Nguni groups. Historically, the Mapulana of Chiloane inhabited Phageng (Empakeni) and the Lepunama River area (Nelspruit), while the Mapulana of Mashego lived at Motsheteng (Emjind",

Like most Sotho-Tswana groups, they venerate Badimo (ancestors). Ancestral acknowledgement ceremonies, known as go phasa badimo, involve facing east towards Shakwaneng, pouring traditional beer and animal blood on a sacrificial platform (legandelo), and ritually calling out the names of ancestors according to hierarchy. The Mmalo (Coral) tree is commonly planted on these sacrificial platforms.\nTraditional medicine is a recognised specialty among the Mapulana, a practice facilitated by the abundance of medicinal herbs in the subtropical climate of Mapulaneng. Traditional doctors, or Dingaka, undergo rigorous and lengthy training under a Gobela (Guru), with trainees referred to as letwasane (Sangoma). Rainmaking was also a notable specialty of the Mapulana, with the tribe's name itself possibly linked to their rain-making capabilities or the Lepunama (White) River.\nThe Mapulana also practice initiation rites for their youth, marking the transition into womanhood and manhood.

These initiation schools (koma) are held during the winter months. Boys who undergo initiation together form a mphato or moroto (regiment), with an elaborate system in place to distinguish regiments based on their initiation year. The rich tapestry of Mapulana cultural practices and their diverse ancestral origins clearly demonstrate that Sepulana is not merely a linguistic code but a fundamental, living component of a complex cultural heritage. The vitality of Sepulana is directly linked to the continuity of these cultural practices, as the language serves as the primary vehicle for transmitting oral histories, performing rituals, teaching traditional medicine, and conducting initiation ceremonies. Its preservation is therefore crucial for the continuity of Mapulana identity and the unique knowledge systems embedded within their traditions. \nThe Mapulana share borders and have had historical interactions with several neighboring tribes, including the AmaSwazi to the south, the Mahlanganu Tsongas to the east, the Bapedi baSekhukhune and Bakone to the west, and the Banareng and Batokwa to the north.

He served as chancellor and was a reformer of the State of Qi during the Spring and Autumn period of Chinese history. His given name was Yiwu (Chinese: 夷吾; pinyin: Yíwú). Zhong was his courtesy name. He is mainly remembered for his reforms as chancellor under Duke Huan of Qi, as well as his friendship with his colleague Bao Shuya, though his reputation remained controversial among the Confucians, as detailed in the appraisal section.\nThrough Guan Zhong's reforms and skilful diplomacy Qi became the most powerful of the feudal states and Duke Huan became the first of the Five Hegemons. Though knowledge of his reforms is limited, in particular he instituted a famous fiscal policy known as  balancing the light and the heavy , associated with salt and iron monopolies.

The Shiji records that, as partner, Guan Zhong often took more than his share of the profits, in effect cheating Bao Shuya. Bao, however, recognised his impoverished background and was not offended.\nTutors of different princes\nSubsequently, Guan Zhong was appointed tutor to Prince Jiu, the younger brother of the ruling Duke Xiang of Qi. Bao Shuya, meanwhile, became tutor to Jiu's younger brother, Prince Xiaobai.\nIn 686 BC, Duke Xiang was murdered in a palace coup by two of his ministers, who then installed Gongsun Wuzhi, a scion of the ducal house, as the new Duke. Recognising that they were in mortal danger, both Prince Jiu and Prince Xiaobai fled with their respective tutors. Prince Jiu fled to the State of Lu, while Prince Xiaobai went to the State of Ju.\nBecoming chancellor\nIn 685 BC, Gongsun Wuzhi himself was killed in another palace coup, and the ministers of Qi sent envoys to Ju, hoping to receive Prince Xiaobai back and succeed to the duchy.

In the resulting conflict, Guan Zhong shot an arrow at Xiaobai which hit his belt buckle. Xiaobai pretended to cough blood and collapse, tricking Guan Zhong into thinking he was mortally wounded.\nEventually, Xiaobai won the race back to Qi, and was installed as Duke. The State of Lu attempted to enforce Prince Jiu's claim, but was defeated in battle, after which Qi forced Lu to execute Prince Jiu and send Guan Zhong back as a prisoner. Xiaobai originally wanted to execute Guan Zhong as well, but Bao Shuya strongly recommended sparing him and elevating him to chancellor, even though that meant he would outrank Bao himself. Xiaobai was eventually convinced.\nDomestic reforms\nDuke Huan had inherited a state in turmoil, after three years of civil wars and usurpation had severely depleted the treasury. As Chancellor, Guan Zhong instituted extensive reforms aimed at organising and strengthening the Qi state.\nAdministratively, the capital was divided into 21 districts: six of merchants, which provided the Qi state's trade revenue, and fifteen of attendants, which provided the core of the Qi army.

Similarly, the population outside the capital was organised: 30 households were formed into one village, 10 villages as one troop, 10 troops as one district, 3 districts as one county, and counties grouped into five regions. Administrators were appointed at every level, with the regional administrators reporting on their jurisdictions to the Duke every year.\nEconomically, Guan Zhong disbanded the well-field system instituted since the Zhou dynasty; instead, all land was to be taxed according to its productivity. At the same time, Qi's coastal position was exploited through the expansion of fisheries and salt production, while trade was encouraged through certain privileges. For instance, people bearing goods to market on foot, and carriages arriving empty at markets to make purchases, were not subject to tolls; this encouraged the use of the state-managed markets.\nGuan Zhong wrote that because taxation would reduce the people's wealth and make them dislike the government, it was better to obtain revenue by monopolizing the sale of salt, iron, forest products, and ore. Thus, these  goods of the mountains and seas  (namely iron and salt) should be state managed. Similarly, a price-regulation scheme existed for food, with granaries buying grain in",

Similarly, a price-regulation scheme existed for food, with granaries buying grain in bounty years to be released into the market in lean years. Finally, coinage was also unified to encourage trade within Qi.\nAppraisal\nGuan Zhong would ultimately be identified with the Legalist school as a result of his administrative reforms. Though actually legalistic philosophy did not develop until hundreds of years later, R. Eno of Indiana University does consider that  If one were to trace the origins of Legalism as far back as possible, it might be appropriate to date its beginnings to the prime ministership of Guan Zhong, chief aide to the first of the hegemonic lords of the Spring Autumn period, Duke Huan of Qi (r. 685 643). \nHe is said to have indulged in a luxurious lifestyle, and did not equate a ruler's moral purity with his ability to govern. Duke Huan, who loved hunting and women, asked Guan if these indulgences would harm his hegemony, to which Guan replied that the ruler's love for luxury would not harm his hegemony. It would only be harmed through inappropriate staffing and misuse of talent.

One passage  recounts  Confucius as considering him  mediocre  for his lack of frugality and knowledge of ritual.\nDespite all this, he might be considered,  at least in most respects  an  ideal Confucian minister . Guan Zhong is reported to have advised Duke Huan: 'Summon the wavering with courtesy and cherish the remote with virtuous conduct. So long as your virtuous conduct and courtesy never falter, there will be no one who does not cherish you.'  When Duke Huan was approached to dethrone the ruling clans of his state, Guan Zhong advised him that he had won their adherence through politeness (li) and trustworthiness (xin).\nWhen Confucius's students criticized Guan Zhong as lacking propriety, crediting his ambition and achievement Confucius said of him that  It was due to Guan Zhong that Duke Huan was able to assemble the feudal lords on numerous occasions without resorting to the use of his war chariots. Such was his goodness! ... Through having Guan Zhong as his minister Duke Huan became protector over the feudal lords.

However, in pre-Qin period,  Ren  has a distinctive utilitarian definition. Hence, from this standpoint, Guan Zhong followed  Ren .\nAchievements\nGuan Zhong started multiple reforms in the State of Qi. Politically, he centralized power and divided the state into different villages, each carrying out a specific trade. Instead of relying on the traditional aristocracy for manpower, he applied levies to the village units directly. He also developed a better method for choosing talent to be governors. Under Guan Zhong, Qi shifted administrative responsibility from hereditary aristocrats to professional bureaucrats. He is also credited for creating the first official government sponsored brothel known as  女市  which funded the government treasury.\nDuring his term of office, the State of Qi became much stronger.

Later, in 652 BC he advised the duke not to ally with a vassal ruler's son who wished to depose his father. Duke Huan often listened to Guan Zhong's sound advice such that his status amongst other Zhou vassal states rose. As a result, the duke came to be recognized as the first Hegemon or leader of the vassal alliance.\nIn recognition of Guan Zhong's service, Duke Huan gave him the honorary title of  Godfather  (仲父). The same title was later given to Lü Buwei by Prince Zheng, the future Qin Shi Huang.\nState Monopoly on Salt and Iron\nUnder Guan's guidance several important economic reforms were introduced. He created a uniform tax code and also used state power to encourage the production of salt and iron.\nHe believed that monopolizing the nature resources was helpful on improving the government income, with fewer complaints from the public than raising taxes.

State of Hengshan was famous for its weapon production. Guan then ordered officials to buy arms from State of Hengshan in large quantities. After ten months, worrying that the price will continuously grow up, State of Yan, State of Dai and later State of Qin followed up the buying. The price then jumped sharply and, as a result, almost all household in State of Hengshan switched to make weapons instead of farming. One year later, Guan ordered officials to buy rice from State of Zhao, at a price more than three times higher than normal. By seeing the potential huge profit, State of Hengshan sold its rice inventory to officials from State of Qi. Afterwards, Guan suddenly ordered State of Qi's army to invade State of Hengshan. With selling out of weapon and rice, State of Hengshan soon surrendered.\nSome historians marked Qi-Hengshan War the early form of Economic Warfare.\nPublications\nHe composed the Guanzi encyclopedia, officially compiled by the Jixia Academy during the Warring States period.\nIn popular culture\nGuan Zhong is one of 32 historical personages featured in the Koei game Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI, where he is referred to as Guan Yiwu.\nReferences\nExternal links\nWorks by Zhong Guan at Project Gutenberg\nWorks by or about Guan Zhong at the Internet Archive\n Master Guan .

Tropical and sub-tropical tree species can be cultivated to grow and thrive indoors, with some suited to bonsai aesthetics shaped as traditional outdoor or wild bonsai.\nBonsai and related practices, like penjing, hòn non bộ, and saikei, involve the long-term cultivation of small trees and landscapes in containers. The term bonsai is generally used in English as an umbrella term for all miniature trees in containers or pots.\nIndoor vs. traditional bonsai\nIndoor bonsai is the cultivation of an attractive, healthy plant in the artificial environment of indoors rather than using an outdoor climate, as may occur in traditional bonsai. Indoor penjing is the cultivation of miniature landscapes in a pot or tray, possibly with rocks, bonsai trees, and ground covers, and sometimes with small objects or figurines.\nBonsai vs. other forms of house plant\nCompared to the usual potted house plant, bonsai are rooted in a much smaller amount of soil. Consequently, they require more frequent watering and feeding. This form is therefore best suited for drought-resistant species. Compared to usual house gardening, bonsais require a lot more pruning, both of branches and roots.\nCultivation and care\nMany of the techniques used to grow and shape outdoor bonsai apply equally to indoor bonsai.

For example, shaping techniques like pruning, wiring, and grafting work much the same for both types of bonsai. But indoor bonsai also have some special requirements for cultivation and care.\nLighting\nAn indoor room comfortably lit for human use provides too little light for most species of tree to grow. Few species will thrive with less than 500 lux available several hours per day. Successful indoor bonsai cultivation requires either selecting from the short list of low-light-tolerant trees, or providing additional lighting for the trees. Insufficient light may not kill some species outright, but will make their growth so slow that the bonsai shaping techniques cannot be used: the plant will not grow back after pruning or leaf trimming.\nThe simplest way to provide extra light is to place the bonsai close to an outside window. Care is taken not to harm the plant either with cold air entering through the window, or with high radiated heat from direct exposure to the sun. More controllable light, and more flexibility in situating the bonsai, can be obtained using artificial lighting. Fluorescent lighting (preferably with bulbs radiating growth-friendly spectra) and light-emitting diode lighting can give sufficient light to support a significant number of indoor bonsai species. These lights also",

Fluorescent lighting (preferably with bulbs radiating growth-friendly spectra) and light-emitting diode lighting can give sufficient light to support a significant number of indoor bonsai species. These lights also have the advantage of blending with other indoor lighting, so that the plants can be grown in normal living quarters. For plants needing the highest amount of light, or for large numbers of bonsai being maintained indoors, a space dedicated to bonsai cultivation can support high-intensity lamps and optionally the special ventilation or cooling often needed for their use.\nTemperature\nSuitable temperatures for indoor bonsai extend from standard room temperature downward. The best temperature range for a tree is determined by its species and, less directly, by its normal range in the wild. Tropical trees are usually tolerant of room temperature year-round but cannot tolerate temperatures approaching freezing, as might occur near an open window in cold weather. Semi-tropical and Mediterranean-climate trees often grow better when temperatures drop well below room temperature during winter months. The lower temperature, combined with shorter periods of daylight, triggers an expected annual dormancy which many non-tropical species need in order to thrive. These non-tropical trees need a cool location in the winter, such as a cool window ledge or  cold room  area in the house.

In addition to the need for seasonal temperature variation, many non-tropicals grow better when there is a distinct difference between day temperatures (warm) and night (cooler).\nHumidity\nIndoor conditions, particularly in homes outside the tropics, imply very low humidity. Both air conditioning and room heating reduce air humidity significantly. Some tree species, such as ficus sp. with their waxy leaves, are tolerant of low humidity. Many species, however, require additional humidification to survive indoors. As with lighting, some humidification solutions can be integrated into the regular living area and some require a dedicated space. Local humidity can be raised by locating the bonsai containers over a tray of water, or by placing them in a bed of dampened sand. For better effect, the bonsai can be placed in enclosures, such as terrariums, that are humidified from within. For the maximum humidity, a dedicated room with high-capacity evaporative or misting humidifiers can support the most sensitive bonsai.\nPlants suitable for indoor bonsai\nTropical\nThe creation of bonsai is limited only by the imagination and talent of the gardener, although some species are much more suitable than others.

    "text": "Essence of Decision: Explaining the Cuban Missile Crisis is book by political scientist Graham T. Allison analyzing the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Allison used the crisis as a case study for future studies into governmental decision-making. The book became the founding study of the John F. Kennedy School of Government, and in doing so revolutionized the field of international relations.\nAllison originally published the book in 1971. In 1999, because of new materials available (including tape recordings of the U.S. government's proceedings), he rewrote the book with Philip Zelikow.\nThe title is based on a speech by John F. Kennedy, in which he said,  The essence of ultimate decision remains impenetrable to the observer - often, indeed, to the decider himself. \nThesis\nWhen he first wrote the book, Allison contended that political science and the study of international relations were saturated with rational expectations theories inherited from the field of economics. Under such a view, the actions of states are analyzed by assuming that nations consider all options and act rationally to maximize their utility.\nAllison attributes such viewpoints to the dominance of economists such as Milton Friedman, statesmen such as Robert McNamara and Henry Kissinger, disciplines such as game theory, and organizations such as the RAND Corporation. However, as he puts it:\nIt must be noted, however, that an imaginative analyst can construct an account of value-maximizing choice for any action or set",

However, as he puts it:\nIt must be noted, however, that an imaginative analyst can construct an account of value-maximizing choice for any action or set of actions performed by a government.\nOr, to put it bluntly, this approach (which Allison terms the  Rational Actor Model ) violates the principle of falsifiability. Also, Allison notes that  rational  analysts must ignore a lot of facts in order to make their analysis fit their models.\nIn response, Allison constructed three different ways (or  lenses ) through which analysts can examine events: the  Rational Actor  model, the  Organizational Behavior  model, and the  Governmental Politics  model.\nTo illustrate the models, Allison poses the following three questions in each section:\nWhy did the Soviet Union decide to place offensive missiles in Cuba?\nWhy did the United States respond to the missile deployment with a blockade?\nWhy did the Soviet Union withdraw the missiles?\nModels\nThe  Rational Actor  Model\nThe origin of Allison's first model is explained above. Basically, under this theory:\nGovernments are treated as the primary actor.\nThe government examines a set of goals, evaluates them according to their utility, then picks the one that has the highest  payoff. \nUnder this theory, Allison explains the crisis like this:\nJohn F.

Kennedy, in 1961, revealed that the Soviet Union, despite rhetoric, had far fewer ICBMs than it claimed. In response, Nikita Khrushchev ordered nuclear missiles with shorter ranges installed in Cuba. In one move, the Soviets bridged the  missile gap  while scoring points in the Cold War. Based on Kennedy's failure to back up the Bay of Pigs Invasion, they believed the U.S. wouldn't respond harshly.\nKennedy and his advisors (EXCOMM) evaluated a number of options, ranging from doing nothing to a full invasion of Cuba. A blockade of Cuba was chosen because it wouldn't necessarily escalate into war, and because it forced the Soviets to make the next move.\nBecause of mutually assured destruction by a nuclear war, the Soviets had no choice but to bow to U.S. demands and remove the weapons.\nAllison guessed that Kennedy must have made an  under the table  agreement concerning American nuclear missiles in Turkey. The American tapes released following 1993 confirmed this and the missiles were quietly removed from Turkey a few years after the crisis.\nThe  Organizational Process  Model\nAllison noted there were many facts that the rational model had to ignore, such as why the Soviets failed to camouflage the nuclear sites during construction, but did so only after U-2 flights pinpoint",

March and Herbert A. Simon, which argue that existing governmental bureaucracy places limits on a nation's actions, and often dictates the outcome. He then proposed the following  organizational process  model propositions:\nWhen faced with a crisis, government leaders don't look at it as a whole, but break it down and assign it according to pre-established organizational lines.\nBecause of time and resource limitations, rather than evaluating all possible courses of action to see which one is most likely to work, leaders settle on the first proposal that adequately addresses the issue, which Simon termed  satisficing. \nLeaders gravitate towards solutions that limit short-term uncertainty (emphasis on  short-term ).\nOrganizations follow set  repertoires  and procedures when taking actions.\nBecause of the large resources and time required to fully plan and mobilize actions within a large organization (or government), leaders are effectively limited to pre-existing plans.\nUnder this theory, the crisis is explained thus:\nBecause the Soviets never established nuclear missile bases outside of their country at the time, they assigned the tasks to established departments, which in turn followed their own set procedures.

Such mistakes included such gaffes as supposedly undercover Soviet troops decorating their barracks with Red Army Stars viewable from above. Alternatively, the secrecy may have been the gaffe, stoking American fears unnecessarily.\nKennedy and his advisors never really considered any other options besides a blockade or air strikes, and initially, were almost unanimously in favor of the air strikes. However, such attacks created massive uncertainty because the U.S. Air Force couldn't guarantee it would disable all the nuclear missiles. Additionally, although Kennedy wanted a  surgical  air strike that would destroy the missiles without inflicting extensive damage, the existing Air Force plan required extensive bombing that would have created more collateral damage than Kennedy desired. Because the U.S. Navy already had considerable strength in the field, because there was a pre-existing plan in place for a blockade, and because Kennedy was able to communicate directly with the fleet's captains, members fell back on the blockade as the only safe option.\nThe Soviets simply did not have a plan to follow if the U.S. took decisive action against their missiles.

Khrushchev's communications indicated a high degree of desperation. Without any back-up plan, the Soviets had to withdraw.\nThe  Bureaucratic Politics  Model\nAfter reading works by Richard Neustadt and Samuel P. Huntington, among others, Allison proposed a third model, which takes account of court politics (or palace politics). While statesmen don't like to admit they play politics to get things done, especially in high-stakes situations such as the Cuban missile crisis, they nonetheless do.\nAllison proposed the following propositions for this model:\nA nation's actions are best understood as the result of politicking and negotiation by its top leaders.\nEven if they share a goal, leaders differ in how to achieve it because of such factors as personal interests and background.\nEven if a leader holds absolute power (e.g., the President of the United States is technically the commander-in-chief), the leader must gain a consensus with his underlings or risk having his order misunderstood or, in some cases, ignored.\nRelated to the above proposition, the make-up of a leader's entourage will have a large effect on the final decision (i.e., an entourage of  yes men  will create a different outcome than a group of advisors who are willing to voice disagreement).\nLeaders have different levels of power based on charisma,",

Likewise, if a leader has already implicitly decided on a particular course of action, an advisor wishing to have influence must work within the framework of the decision the leader has already made.\nIf a leader fails to reach a consensus with his inner circle (or, at least, the appearance of a consensus), opponents may take advantage of these disagreements. Therefore, effective leaders must create a consensus.\nBecause of the possibilities of miscommunication, misunderstandings, and downright disagreements, different leaders may take actions that the group as a whole would not approve of.\nAllison had to admit that, because the Soviets were not as open with their internal affairs as the Americans, he simply didn't have enough data to fully interpret the crisis with this model. Nonetheless, he made the following attempt:\nKhrushchev came under increasing fire from the Presidium because of Kennedy's revelation of the Soviet lack of ICBMs, as well as American successes in the Berlin Airlift. Also, the Soviet economy was being stretched, and military leaders were unhappy with Khrushchev's decision",

Also, the Soviet economy was being stretched, and military leaders were unhappy with Khrushchev's decision to cut the size of the Red Army. Placing missiles in Cuba was a cheap and quick way for him to secure his political base.\nBecause of the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion, Republicans in the Congress made Cuban policy into a major issue for the upcoming congressional elections later in 1962. Therefore, Kennedy immediately decided on a strong response rather than a diplomatic one. Although a majority of EXCOMM initially favored air strikes, those closest to the president - such as his brother and Attorney General, Robert F. Kennedy, and special counsel Theodore Sorensen - favored the blockade. At the same time, Kennedy got into arguments with proponents of the air strikes, such as Air Force General Curtis LeMay. After the Bay of Pigs Invasion fiasco, Kennedy also distrusted the CIA and its advice. In order to avoid appearing weak to the hawkish members of EXCOMM, Kennedy rejected the purely diplomatic proposals of United States Ambassador to the United Nations Adlai Stevenson. This combination of push and pull led to a consensus for the implication of a blockade.\nWith his plans thwarted, Khrushchev tried to save face by pointing to American missiles in Turkey, a position similar to the Cuban missiles.

While Kennedy refused to move these missiles  under duress,  he allowed Robert Kennedy to reach a deal with Soviet ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin, in which the Turkish missiles would be quietly removed several months later. Publicly, Kennedy also agreed never to invade Cuba.\nImplications\nWhen the book was first published, Allison's primary message was that the concept of mutually assured destruction as a barrier to nuclear war was unfounded. By looking at organizational and political models, such an outcome was quite possible - nations, against what was predicted by the rational viewpoint, could indeed  commit suicide. \nHe pointed to several incidents in history that seemed to back this assertion. His most salient point: prior to the attack at Pearl Harbor, Japanese military and civilian leaders, including those responsible for making the decision, were fully aware that they lacked the industrial capacity and military might to win a war against the U.S. They went ahead and attacked anyway.\nHe also believed that the organizational model explained otherwise inexplicable gaffes in military history. To return to 1941, he noted that the U.S. intercepted enough evidence to indicate that Japan was about to attack Pearl Harbor, yet the commander did not prepare.

The answer, Allison revealed, was not some conspiracy, but that what the intelligence community viewed as a  threat of attack,  the commander interpreted as a  threat of sabotage.  This miscommunication, due to different viewpoints, allowed the attack to be pulled off successfully - as Allison sarcastically noted, having U.S. planes lined up wing-to-wing and surrounded by armed guards was a good plan for preventing sabotage, but not for surviving an aerial attack.\nLikewise, the political process model explained otherwise confusing affairs. Allison pointed to the decision by General Douglas MacArthur to defy his orders during the Korean War and march too far north. The reason was not a  rational  change in U.S. intentions, but rather, MacArthur's disagreements with Harry Truman and other policymakers, and how officials allowed MacArthur to make what they considered unwise moves because of concerns over political backlash due to the general's public popularity.\nAbove all, he described using rational actor models as dangerous. By using such models (and modes of thinking), people made unreliable assumptions about reality, which could have disastrous consequences. Part of what allowed the attack on Pearl Harbor to be pulled off was the assumption that, since Japan would lose such a war, they would never dare attack.

Part of what allowed the attack on Pearl Harbor to be pulled off was the assumption that, since Japan would lose such a war, they would never dare attack. The assumption under MAD is that nobody will ever start a nuclear war because of its consequences. However, humans are not inextricably bound to act in a rational manner, which history has proven time and time again.\nWhile Allison did not claim that any of his additional two models could fully explain anything, he noted that policymakers and analysts alike would benefit from stepping away from the traditional model and exploring alternate viewpoints (although this last remark could be viewed as facetious on Allison's part).\nCriticism\nThe book is part of an ongoing argument between supporters of rational expectations theories and analysts who look for alternative explanations.\nMoreover, Allison pointed out that the  rational actor  model continues to be applied even in long-term analyses (i.e., analyses that take place long after the event or  crisis  is past). In Essence of Decision, Allison suggests that one reason for the popularity of rational actor models is that, compared to other models, they require relatively little data and provide researchers with an  inexpensive approximation  of the situation. Allison also quotes Thomas Schelling's description of rationalistic thinking and vicarious problem solving:\nYou can sit in your armchair and try to predict how people will behave by asking how you would behave if you had your wits around you.

You get, free of charge, a lot of vicarious, empirical behavior.\nFinally, in Allison's first edition (1971), he was unable to fully explore his theories because much of the information was still classified. As a result, he made a number of assumptions on his own part. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the release of American recordings of EXCOMM, this new information (included in the revised 1999 edition) sometimes agreed with Allison's assumptions, but sometimes didn't.\nFor example, in 1971, Allison guessed that Kennedy must have made an  under the table  agreement concerning the Turkish missiles, probably using his brother as a liaison. The American tapes confirmed this.\nHowever, Allison also guessed in 1971 that Khrushchev must have formed his own  EXCOMM,  or his own committee of advisors, to aid him during the crisis, and even named the Russian leaders he believed were with Khrushchev at the time. However, the Soviet records revealed that these individuals were not present, and Khrushchev was effectively stuck alone in his office during the crisis without the type of support Kennedy had.\nReferences\nAllison, Graham (1971).

It is native to areas in South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria.\nDescription\nThe bushy shrub or small typically grows to a height of 1.5 to 4 metres (5 to 13 ft) and has glabrous and terete branchlets. Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. The grey to green, inclined to ascending and straight or slightly incurved, rigid phyllodes are 3 to 9 cm (1.2 to 3.5 in) in length and 0.8 to 1.5 mm (0.031 to 0.059 in) wide and are quite brittle and tend to break easily. It blooms between July and October producing simple inflorescences which occur in group of one to three in the axils and have spherical flower-heads with a diameter of 3 to 7.5 mm (0.12 to 0.30 in) and contain 20 to 30 bright yellow coloured flowers. Following flowering it produces glabrous and firmly papery seed pods which are straight to curved and raised over each seed and slightly constricted between them and have a length of 3 to 9 cm (1.2 to 3.5 in)",

    "text": "A magnetic lens is a device for the focusing or deflection of moving charged particles, such as electrons or ions, by use of the magnetic Lorentz force. Its strength can often be varied by usage of electromagnets.\nMagnetic lenses are used in diverse applications, from cathode ray tubes over electron microscopy to particle accelerators.\nDesign\nA magnetic lens typically consists of several electromagnets arranged in a quadrupole (see quadrupole magnet), sextupole, or higher format; the electromagnetic coils are placed at the vertices of a square or another regular polygon. From this configuration a customized magnetic field can be formed to manipulate the particle beam.\nThe passing particle is subjected to two vector forces \n \n \n \n \n H\n \n Z\n \n \n \n \n   displaystyle H_ Z  \n \n (parallel to the core), and \n \n \n \n \n H\n \n R\n \n \n \n \n   displaystyle H_ R  \n \n (parallel to the radius of the lens). \n \n \n \n \n H\n \n R\n \n \n \n \n   displaystyle H_ R  \n \n causes the particle to spiral through the lens, and this spiraling expose the electron to \n \n \n \n \n H\n \n Z\n \n \n \n \n   displaystyle H_ Z  \n \n which in turn focus the electron. Note that the magnetic field is inhomogeneous, particles close to the center are less strongly deflected than those passing the lens far from the axis.\nUses\nTelevision sets employing cathode ray tubes use a magnetic lens in the form of a deflection yoke to enable an electron beam to scan the image by deflecting it vertically and horizontally.\nSee also\nCharged particle beam\nElectron optics\nElectron beam technology\nIon beam\nMass spectrometry\nQuadrupole ion trap\nQuadrupole mass analyzer\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Magnetic lens at Wikimedia Commons",

At age six, Orrico wrote her first song, entitled  Always Answer . She also attended missionary school with singer Allen Stone.\nCareer\n1999 2001: Early work and debut album\nOrrico got her start at the age of 13, by attending a Christian music festival, Praise in the Rockies, held in her then-home state of Colorado. Orrico inadvertently entered a high-stakes talent competition, and won. A ForeFront Records executive was on hand and approached her for a record deal. She later signed with them. In 2001, she toured with Destiny's Child as their opening act on select dates of their Survivor tour in the United States.\nShe went on to release two albums. The first was Genuine (2000), which she recorded at age 14. It sold over 13,000 copies in the first week, the highest debut-week sales ever for a female Christian artist.

    "text": "In set theory and its applications throughout mathematics, a class is a collection of mathematical objects (often sets) that can be unambiguously defined by a property that all its members share. Classes act as a way to have set-like collections while differing from sets so as to avoid paradoxes, especially Russell's paradox (see   Paradoxes). The precise definition of  class  depends on foundational context. In work on Zermelo Fraenkel set theory, the notion of class is informal, whereas other set theories, such as von Neumann Bernays Gödel set theory, axiomatize the notion of  proper class , e.g., as entities that are not members of another entity.\nA class that is not a set (informally in Zermelo Fraenkel) is called a proper class, and a class that is a set is sometimes called a small class. For instance, the class of all ordinal numbers, and the class of all sets, are proper classes in many formal systems.\nIn Quine's set-theoretical writing, the phrase  ultimate class  is often used instead of the phrase  proper class  emphasising that in the systems he considers, certain classes cannot be members, and are thus the final term in any membership chain to which they belong.\nOutside set theory, the word  class  is sometimes used synonymously with  set . This usage dates from a historical period when classes and sets were not distinguished as they are in modern set-theoret",

This usage dates from a historical period when classes and sets were not distinguished as they are in modern set-theoretic terminology. Many discussions of  classes  in the 19th century and earlier are really referring to sets, or rather perhaps take place without considering that certain classes can fail to be sets.\nExamples\nThe collection of all algebraic structures of a given type will usually be a proper class. Examples include the class of all groups, the class of all vector spaces, and many others. In category theory, a category whose collection of objects forms a proper class (or whose collection of morphisms forms a proper class) is called a large category.\nThe surreal numbers are a proper class of objects that have the properties of a field.\nWithin set theory, many collections of sets turn out to be proper classes. Examples include the class of all sets (the universal class), the class of all ordinal numbers, and the class of all cardinal numbers.\nOne way to prove that a class is proper is to place it in bijection with the class of all ordinal numbers. This method is used, for example, in the proof that there is no free complete lattice on three or more generators.\nParadoxes\nThe paradoxes of naive set theory can be explained in terms of the inconsistent tacit assumption that  all classes are sets .

With a rigorous foundation, these paradoxes instead suggest proofs that certain classes are proper (i.e., that they are not sets). For example, Russell's paradox suggests a proof that the class of all sets which do not contain themselves is proper, and the Burali-Forti paradox suggests that the class of all ordinal numbers is proper. The paradoxes do not arise with classes because there is no notion of classes containing classes. Otherwise, one could, for example, define a class of all classes that do not contain themselves, which would lead to a Russell paradox for classes. A conglomerate, on the other hand, can have proper classes as members.\nClasses in formal set theories\nZF set theory does not formalize the notion of classes, so each formula with classes must be reduced syntactically to a formula without classes. For example, one can reduce the formula \n \n \n \n A\n  \n  \n x\n  \n x\n  \n x\n  \n \n \n   displaystyle A   x mid x x   \n \n to \n \n \n \n  \n x\n (\n x\n  \n A\n  \n x\n  \n x\n )\n \n \n   displaystyle  forall x(x in A leftrightarrow x x) \n \n.

This causes Morse Kelley set theory to be strictly stronger than both NBG and ZFC.\nOther set theories, such as New Foundations or the theory of semisets, still give rise to  proper classes  (insofar as they require classes that are not sets), because they do not postulate that all subclasses of a set are themselves sets.

Reagan cites the failure of President Harry S.

Forand is quoted as having said,  If we can only break through and get our foot inside the door, then we can extend the program after that.  Forand is likened to labor union leader Walter Reuther, who is quoted as having said,  It's no secret that the United Automobile Workers is officially on record of backing a program of national health insurance.  The Forand bill is described as being praised by socialists:  They say once the Forand bill is passed this nation will be provided with a mechanism for socialized medicine capable of indefinite expansion in every direction until it includes the entire population. Now we can't say we haven't been warned. \nReagan describes Representative Cecil R.

Reagan cites the expansion of private health insurance and the passage of the 1960 Kerr-Mills Act, which provided federal funds to states to cover the  medically needy,  as evidence that King's legislation is unnecessary. Reagan concludes that the new bill is  simply an excuse to bring about what they wanted all the time: socialized medicine.  Reagan warns against the danger of encroaching on the relationship between patients and doctors, and of an attack on doctors' freedoms.\nReagan encourages his listeners to join a letter-writing campaign to Congress with the message,  We do not want socialized medicine.  Reagan quotes Representative Charles A. Halleck of Indiana as having said,  When the American people wants something from Congress, regardless of its political complexion, if they make their wants known, Congress does what the people want.  Reagan warns that if his listeners do not stop the proposed medical program,  behind it will come other government programs that will invade every area of freedom as we have known it in this country until one day as Norman Thomas said we will wake to find that we have socialism.

In response, Reagan accused him of  pure demagoguery  in suggesting that California's elderly had reason to fear a Reagan victory in the race for governor.\nIn 1980, President Jimmy Carter, campaigning for re-election against Reagan, told crowds that:  As a traveling salesman for the American Medical Association campaign against Medicare,  Reagan  sowed the fear that Medicare would mean socialism and that it would lead to the destruction of our freedom.  When the subject arose in a televised debate in late October, Reagan responded:  When I opposed Medicare, there was another piece of legislation meeting the same problem before Congress. I happened to favor the other piece of legislation and thought it would be better for the senior citizens. ... I was not opposing the principle of providing care for them...

In January 1864, the regiment was re-formed as its three-year term had expired. The unit later participated in raids with Stoneman and Wilson before it was discharged on August 14, 1865. Charles Oliver Brown, D.D. followed his father at the age of thirteen, Major Oliver M. Brown, with the unit, served throughout the war and became the  Boy Bugler  of Sherman's Army.\nSeveral Kelleys Island men volunteered and served in the 3rd Ohio Cavalry including: Pitt Simmons, John Ward, John Monaghan, Stephen French, Michael Hughes, August Raab, John T. Woodford, George Wright, Henry Pope and Jacob Rush (mostly companies A and L). Jacob Rush's involvement in the unit was particularly interesting. He enlisted at the age of 15, was brought home by his parents, then allowed to enlist again a few months later. Just weeks before his enlistment expired, he was sent on one last mission and captured as a spy. He provided a first hand account of his interrogation by General Nathan Bedford Forrest. He spent 8 months in Cahaba Prison where he helped organize a (failed) escape attempt. Upon his release at the end of the war, he was one of the few soldiers who survived the 'Sultana' explosion. He worked his way home and established the Island House resort on Kelleys Island. When that burned in 1877, he moved to Larned, Kansas and played a key role in building that city. He also served as a Kansas State Senator. He was a prolific writer for the local newspaper, the Islander, and shared many stories of his time in service in the 3rd Ohio Cavalry.\nSee also\nList of Ohio Civil War units\n   References",

Thalhammer was dismissed from LASK in September 2021.\nCercle Brugge and KV Oostende\nWithin two months, Thalhammer was approached by lowly Belgian Pro League team Cercle Brugge, who were second-from-bottom and fighting relegation. The Austrian won seven of his first eight games in charge at Cercle, finishing the 2021-22 Pro League season 10th of the 18 clubs, missing out on the European play-offs by two places.

The company designed and manufactured in-ear computing technology, including earplugs and wireless smart earbuds.\nHistory\nDoppler Labs was co-founded by Noah Kraft, Fritz Lanman, and Dan Wiggins. Kraft had previously worked in the entertainment industry, and was employed as a strategic consultant for Google working for John Hanke on a mobile game called Ingress. Kraft also worked for Lyor Cohen during the founding of 300 Entertainment. Lanman was an executive at Microsoft and a prominent angel investor. Dan Wiggins is a long-time veteran in the acoustics and technology world who has worked for Rode, Event Electronics, Siemens, Microsoft, SONOS, Apple, Dolby and many more.\nBefore voice assistants or true wireless technology were prevalent, Doppler Labs envisioned that computing would move onto the body and into the ear and that voice would become a more primary interface for how humans interact with technology. With Apple's removal of the headphone jack, the launch of the AirPods, and the prevalence of Alexa, the smart earbud category that Doppler helped create was expected to become a  40 billion industry by 2020.\nIn July 2015, Doppler raised  17 million in series B funding bringing the company's total funding to over  50 million.

It is a three-dimensional action-adventure game that was developed by Talon Inc. and published by Sammy. The story focuses on a counter-terrorist unit known as INTER-ANTS (International Anti-terrorist Service).\nGameplay\nThe game is set in 2001, when a terrorist organization known as Hephaestus has risen, with the aforementioned INTER-ANTS being formed as a response to combat them.\nDeep Freeze is an action adventure game. All the characters act in teams. At the beginning of each mission, players can pick one of five characters who will play as a partner and provide cover fire. This computer-controlled partner can be controlled through simple commands.\nThe game features many weapons the player can choose from the start, including a shotgun, Uzi submachine gun, and magnum handgun. Players can also collect grenades in the game, which can flush out enemies hidden behind obstacles such as barrels. The player can also perform rolls, which allows them to dodge bullets from enemies.\nDespite being released in Japan only, the game features English voice acting. However, all the menus in the game are in Japanese.\nThe game uses pre-rendered backgrounds and camera switching in a similar fashion to the game Resident Evil.\nRelease\nThe game was shown at the 2000 Tokyo Games Show gaming convention in Japan.",

The publisher, Sammy, was more well known at the time for developing pachinko games.\nDeep Freeze was released on January 14, 1999, for the Sony PlayStation home console, and was published by Sammy. The game was re-released on July 19, 2000, in the SuperLite 1500 budget line of games. The game has never been released outside of Japan, nor has it ever been released on the PlayStation Network game archives either.\nReception\nThe game received mostly positive reviews upon release. Famitsu gave the game a score of 26 out of 40. Ralph Karels writing in the German video game magazine Video Games gave it a 75 out of 100. He recommended the game for fans of Resident Evil series, and those who like import games. However, he cautioned that knowledge of Japanese is needed to complete the game because the menus are in Japanese. Super Gamepower gave it a score of 4 out of 5 in all categories (sound, graphics, fun, control) and an overall score of 4 out of 5. The writer described the game as like Resident Evil, with more action and shooting but less blood and gore.\nMega Fun gave it a 78.\nGamers' Republic gave the game a score of C and was rather critical of it. The writer says that the mixture of fast action and pre-rendered backgrounds does not mix and causes disorientation. The writer explained that such a format worked for Resident Evil since it was slower paced, it doesn't work in Deep Freeze. Also, the writer commented on the voice acting, calling it  horrendous  and said the enemy AI was too passive for simply standing there while the player reloaded.\nSee also\nHard Edge\n   References",

From the east, the highway stretches from the Grantley Adams International Airport in Christ Church, to the western end at Cave Hill Road and University Drive, Cave Hill Campus, University of the West Indies, in Saint Michael. It roughly encircles the Parish of Saint Michael and the wider metropolitan area of Bridgetown.\nRoute description\nThe highway consists of two-lane and dual carriageway sections with at-grade intersections, mostly roundabouts. A 2006 2007 expansion project enlarged some areas, and there was some public sentiment voiced in local media about the project's lack of a competitive tender process or studies to justify costs. On July 24, 2006, Rayside Construction and C.O.

    "text": "Dyadic kinship terms (abbreviated DY or DYAD) are kinship terms in a few languages that express the relationship between individuals as they relate one to the other. In English, there are a few set phrases for such situations, such as  they are father and son , but there is not a single dyadic term that can be used the way  they are cousins  can; even the latter is not truly dyadic, as it does not necessarily mean that they are cousins to each other. The few, and uncommon, English dyadic terms involve in-laws: co-mothers-in-law, co-fathers-in-law, co-brothers-in-law, co-sisters-in-law, co-grandmothers, and co-grandfathers. \nExamples of dyadic terms for blood kin include Kayardild (Australian) ngamathu-ngarrba  mother and child , derived from ngamathu  mother , and kularrin-ngarrba  brother and sister , from kularrin  cross-sibling , with the dyadic suffix -ngarrba. Not all such terms are derived; the Ok language Mian has a single unanalysable root lum for  father and child .\nDyadic blood-kin terms are rare in Indo-European languages. Examples are Icelandic and Faroese, which have the terms feðgar  father and son , feðgin  father and daughter , mæðgin  mother and son ,",

The Royal Proclamation of 1763 enlarged the colony of Canada under the name of the Province of Quebec, which with the Constitutional Act 1791 became known as the Canadas. With the Act of Union 1840, Upper and Lower Canada were joined to become the Province of Canada.\nBy the 1860s, interest developed in forming a new federation between the Canadas and the other British colonies of British North America, that led to Confederation in 1867. A number of other British colonies that are today part of Canada, such as Newfoundland and British Columbia, and large territories such as Rupert's Land, initially remained outside the newly formed federation.\nNew France under British rule\nIn North America, the Seven Years' War had seen Great Britain conquer the entirety of the French colony of Canada. The war officially ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on February 10, 1763.

Although many British people (including the American colonies to the south) hoped the French Canadians would be assimilated this was not the case as distinct rules of governance for Quebec were set out in the Quebec Act such as allowing the French Canadians to retain their Catholic religion and their French system of civil law. The Quebec Act became one of the Intolerable Acts that infuriated the thirteen British colonies in what would become the United States of America.\nAtlantic coast\nThe island colony of Newfoundland had been dominated by the British for a long time before the French finally abandoned any claims to the area.

The establishment of Halifax sparked Father Le Loutre's War, which, in turn, led to the British expelling the Acadians from the region during the French and Indian War. As they later captured Cape Breton Island and Prince Edward Island, the policy of expulsion was extended there as well. The few Acadians who managed to return to the area have created the contemporary Acadian society. Once the Acadians were expelled, other settlements were formed by New England Planters.\nAmerican Revolution\nIn 1775, American revolutionaries (Patriots) attempted to push their insurrection into northeastern Quebec. Support for the Patriot cause was mixed; the clergy and landowners were generally opposed to it, while English-speaking merchants and migrants from the Thirteen Colonies were generally supportive of it.

The only major event of their resistance was the Battle of Fort Cumberland, when Eddy and a combined force of Massachusetts Patriots, Acadians, and aboriginals besieged the fort in November 1776. The siege was broken and Eddy's forces were scattered when British reinforcements arrived. Eddy and Allan continued to make trouble on the frontier between what is now Maine and New Brunswick from a base in Machias for several years.\nThe Maritime provinces were also affected by privateering, and raids on settlements by privateers in violation of their letters of marque.

From there, part of his men took Vincennes, but was soon lost to British Lieutenant Colonel Henry Hamilton, the commander at Fort Detroit. It was later retaken by Clark in the Siege of Fort Vincennes in February 1779. Roughly half of Clark's militia in the theatre were Canadien volunteers sympathetic to the American cause.\nIn the end, the British Empire was defeated in the Revolutionary War and formally ceded parts of southwestern Canada to the new United States as part of the Treaty of Paris. During and after the Revolution, approximately 70,000 or 15  United Empire Loyalists fled the United States, with the rest of the 85  choosing to stay in the new nation.

On land, expeditions took place hoping for a discovery of a practicable river route to the Pacific for the extension of the North American fur trade, namely the North West Company. Sir Alexander Mackenzie led the first starting out in 1792 overland from Lake Athabasca via the Peace and Fraser Rivers, reaching the Pacific ocean near present-day Bella Coola on 20 July 1793. Mackenzie became the first European to reach the Pacific overland north of the Rio Grande which preceded the Lewis and Clark Expedition by twelve years. Shortly thereafter, Mackenzie's companion, John Finlay, founded the first permanent European settlement in British Columbia, Fort St. John. The North West Company sought further explorations firstly by David Thompson, starting in 1797, and later by Simon Fraser.

During the war, unsuccessful attempts were made by the Americans to invade Upper Canada, after overestimating the amount of support they would receive from Canadian colonists. Much of the settler population of Upper Canada (now southern Ontario) were Americans who had very recently arrived in the colony, and some of them did support the invading force; however, the rest of the settler population was made up of the descendants of Loyalists or the original French colonists, who did not want to be part of the United States. The first American invasion came in October 1812, but they were defeated by General Isaac Brock at the Battle of Queenston Heights. The Americans invaded again in 1813, capturing Fort York (now Toronto).

In English Canada, it is seen as a victory against American invasions, with heroic legends surrounding many of the participants (such as Isaac Brock and Laura Secord) and battles (especially those in the Niagara Peninsula).\nFur trade\nFor centuries one of the most important economic ventures in North America was the fur trade. This trade, which had been pioneered by the French, came to be dominated by the British as they gained increasing territory on the continent. The main British fur trading posts were located inside of what became the United States (the British were forced to relocate northward as borders were established with the new nation). First Nations were central to the trade as they were the primary fur trappers. The role gave the peoples of many of the First Nations a political voice as, though they were viewed as an underclass, they were too important to simply be ignored. The American Revolution led to intense competition between the British and the U.S. By the 1830s changing fashions in Europe had begun a steep decline in fur prices",

The American Revolution led to intense competition between the British and the U.S. By the 1830s changing fashions in Europe had begun a steep decline in fur prices and an overall collapse in the market. Apart from the economic losses to whites involved in the fur trade, many of the First Nations were devastated, both in terms of economic loss and in terms of loss of influence in local politics.\nTimber trade\nAs the fur trade declined in importance, the timber trade became Canada's most important commodity. The industry became concentrated in three main regions. The first to be exploited was the Saint John River system. Trees in the still almost deserted hinterland of New Brunswick were cut and transported to Saint John where they were shipped to England. This area soon could not keep up with demand, and the trade moved to the St. Lawrence River where logs were shipped to Quebec City before being sent on to Europe. This area also became insufficient, and the trade expanded westward, most notably to the Ottawa River system, which by 1845 provided three quarters of the timber shipped from Quebec City. The timber trade became a massive business. In one summer 1200 ships were loaded with timber at Quebec City alone.\n Responsible government  and the Rebellions of 1837 38\nAfter the War of 1812, the first half of the 19th century saw the growth of political reform movements in both",

The colonial legislatures set out by the Constitutional Act had become dominated by wealthy elites, the Family Compact in Upper Canada and the Château Clique in Lower Canada. The moderate reformers, such as Robert Baldwin and Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine, argued for a more representational form of government which they called  responsible government .\nBy  responsible,  the reformers meant that such a government would be ultimately responsible to the will of the subjects of the colonies, not to authorities in London. The critical move toward responsible government came between 1846 and 1850. In practice, it meant that the Executive Council of each colony formulated policy with the assistance of the legislative branch. The legislature voted approval or disapproval, and the appointed governor enacted those policies that it had approved. It was a transition from the older system when the governor took advice from an executive council, and use the legislature chiefly to raise money.

His attempts at reform were ignored by the British, and in 1834, the assembly passed The Ninety-Two Resolutions, outlining its grievances against the legislative council. Papineau organized boycotts and civil disobedience. The colonial government illegally ordered the arrest of Papineau. The Patriotes resorted to armed resistance and planned the Lower Canada Rebellion in the fall of 1837. British troops in the colony quickly put down the rebellion and forced Papineau to flee to the United States. A second rebellion by the Frères chasseurs of Robert Nelson broke out one year later, but the British put it down as well, with much loss of life and destruction of property.\nWilliam Lyon Mackenzie, a Scottish immigrant and reformist mayor of York (Toronto), organized the Upper Canada Rebellion in December 1837 after the Patriotes rebellion had begun. Upper Canadians had similar grievances; they were annoyed at the undemocratic governance of the colony, and especially by the corrupt and inefficient Bank of Upper Canada and the Canada Company.

Metcalfe fought to preserve the prerogatives of the Crown and the governor's control over the administration and patronage.

However, the achievement must be seen in the wider politics of British North America which had seen the major boundary disputes with the United States settled (see Rush Bagot Treaty, Treaty of 1818, Webster Ashburton Treaty, Oregon Treaty), thus easing tensions which for most of the first half of the 19th century had Americans threatening war or retaliation.\nThe Union Act of 1840 was ultimately unsuccessful, and led to calls for a greater political union in the 1850s and 1860s.

A political conservative, MacDonald forged political relationships and coalitions with George-Étienne Cartier, the leader of powerful French Canadian bleus, and George Brown of the more stridently reformist English-Canadian and anti-French  Grits . MacDonald came to realize that Canada's likeliest hope of resisting absorption into the United States was to reform itself into a workable federation. A delegation from the Canadas made its way to a conference being held in Charlottetown in 1864 by representatives from the Maritimes who had intended to hold discussions regarding a federation of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. This conference was followed by a subsequent conference in Quebec City. The Seventy-Two Resolutions from the 1864 Quebec Conference laid out",

This conference was followed by a subsequent conference in Quebec City. The Seventy-Two Resolutions from the 1864 Quebec Conference laid out the framework for uniting British colonies in North America into a federation. They were adopted by the majority of the provinces of Canada and became the basis for the London Conference of 1866, which led to the formation of the Dominion of Canada on July 1, 1867. Federation emerged from multiple impulses: the British wanted Canada to defend itself; the Maritimes needed railroad connections, which were promised in 1867; British-Canadian nationalism sought to unite the lands into one country, dominated by the English language and British culture; many French-Canadians saw an opportunity to exert political control within a new largely French-speaking Quebec. Finally, but by no means least significant, were fears of possible U.S. expansion northward in the wake of the end of the United States Civil War. On a political level, there was a desire for the expansion of responsible government and elimination of the legislative deadlock between Upper and Lower Canada, and their replacement with provincial legislatures in a federation. This was especially pushed by the liberal Reform movement of Upper Canada and the French-Canadian rouges in Lower Canada who favoured a decentralized union in comparison to the Upper Canadian Conservative party and to some degree the French-Canadian bleus which favoured a centralized union.",

Even Queen Victoria was supportive, noting  ...the impossibility of our being able to hold Canada, but we must struggle for it; and by far the best solution would be to let it go as an independent kingdom under an English prince.  In the end Canada went as a Dominion under the Crown of the United Kingdom itself. It was a fresh start, but not one that was greeted with universal joy. While some envisaged Confederation for the British North American colonies as a way forward together, La Minerve, a newspaper in the new Province of Quebec endorsed the federation because it provided  la seule voie qui nous soit offerte pour arriver à l'indépendance politique.  ( the only way offered to us to achieve political independence ).

However, despite its declaration that it is an Act to promote and protect individual privacy, it in fact only covers information privacy. The Privacy Act was created to combat concerns about technological advances and their potential to be used to access private information, when this risk had been far less under manual data systems.\nThe Act contains 13 Information Privacy Principles which govern the handling of private information by agencies. An 'agency' is widely defined as any person or body of persons, whether public or private, and whether corporate or unincorporated, with specified exceptions. There are also numerous exceptions to the Information Privacy Principles, which can be found both within the principles and in other places within the Act.\nWhen an individual feels there has been a breach of the principles he or she can lodge a complaint with the Privacy Commissioner. The Privacy Commissioner investigates the complaint and undertakes a process of conciliation rather than punishment. If the complaint cannot be settled, it may be referred to the Human Rights Review Tribunal, which may or may not consider the situation anew, and it's quite likely",

If the complaint cannot be settled, it may be referred to the Human Rights Review Tribunal, which may or may not consider the situation anew, and it's quite likely that they won't consider a complaint at all (especially if the issue is related to debt). If the Tribunal finds there has been a breach, it may award a range of remedies including damages and restraining orders.\nThe Privacy Act recognises that privacy is not an absolute concept and that there are other factors which need to be weighed to determine what the outcome should be. The Privacy Commissioner must always have regard to factors such as human rights, social interests, and international obligations and guidelines. The Privacy Commissioner is able to make authorisations regarding the use of private information which would normally be contrary to the Act if he or she is satisfied that the public interest or benefit outweighs the interference with privacy.\nBroadcasting Act 1989\nThe Broadcasting Act 1989 requires broadcasters to maintain standards consistent with the privacy of the individual. The Act establishes the Broadcasting Standards Authority (BSA), which has the functions of receiving and deciding complaints against broadcasters, issuing opinions relating to ethical conduct and standards in broadcasting, and issuing codes of practice for broadcasters and encouraging compliance with them.

The case which is accepted to be the first which found that a tort of privacy may exist was Tucker v News Media Ownership Ltd, in which the judge supported the introduction of such a tort into the law of New Zealand. A few years later in \nBradley v Wingnut Films, the judge accepted that a tort of privacy did exist in New Zealand law, but that it should be approached with caution as it was in the earlier stages of development. The most crucial New Zealand High Court decision was that of P and D v Independent News Auckland Ltd, where the court defined the elements of a tort of privacy as:\nThe public disclosure of facts\nThe facts disclosed are of a private nature\nThe facts made public would be considered highly offensive to a reasonable person\nThere is insufficient legitimate public concern in having the facts made public.\nThe New Zealand Court of Appeal in a bare majority in Hosking v Runting",

The tort was affirmed as protection in this area was needed and the breach of confidence tort was not suitable to cover situations involving privacy. The two requirements for the tort set out by the majority closely reflect those set out in P v D:\nExistence of facts which were reasonably expected to be private\nPublicity given to those facts which would be considered highly offensive by the objective and reasonable person.\nIn addition, privacy had to be weighed against the defence of legitimate public concern which encompasses the right to freedom of expression.\nThe Supreme Court of New Zealand has in one case accepted that a tort of privacy exists for the purposes of a case before it, but had differing opinions about its requirements and application. In Brooker v Police the court acknowledged the decision of Hosking but refrained from commenting.\nSecurity and intelligence\nNew Zealand s intelligence and security agencies\nTwo government bodies are responsible for monitoring New Zealand's national security: the Government Communications Security Bureau (the 'GCSB') and the Security Intelligence Service (the 'SIS').

Prior to the introduction of the Intelligence and Security Act 2017, these bodies operated strictly independently of one another, and general mystery surrounded their exact functions and capabilities. Much of the confusion originated from the fact that the SIS and GCSB appeared to have differing objectives which meant that, if required, co-operation and coordination would likely be complex and convoluted.\nFor example, only the SIS could perform surveillance, or spy, on New Zealanders, as provided by the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service Act 1969. There were stipulations as to what 'spy-activities' were permitted, and as a pre-requisite, any proposed surveillance had to be relevant to  security  and its associated threats, such as instances of 'espionage, sabotage, subversion or terrorist attacks'.\nThe 2013 surveillance landscape\nIn September 2012, Paul Neazor, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security advised John Key, the then New Zealand Prime Minister, of a situation which would later be called an  unlawful interception  of an individual known as Kim Dotcom by the GCSB. Following a formal request from the United States' Federal Bureau of Investigation that Kim Dotcom be extradited to the United States, the GCSB spied on Mr Dotcom in order to assist the FBI's request.

They assigned the then Cabinet Secretary Rebecca Kitteridge with undertaking the review to look into the  activities, systems and processes since 1 April 2003 . This date is significant as it was the date from which the Government Communications Security Bureau Act 2003 came into force.\nThe  Kitteridge Report  ultimately concluded that GCSB lacked the legal basis and authority to perform many of its intelligence acts   including the surveillance carried out on Kim Dotcom. The Kitteridge Report made a number of recommendations to ensure that the Government agency had the legal authority to do the activities necessary. All of the recommendations presented in the Kitteridge Report were accepted by the Government and GCSB which led to a number of legislative reforms.

One of the prominent issues identified was that the fragmented legislative landscape meant that it was difficult to bring the multiple agencies together when required. Because each intelligence and security agency operated under its own legislative framework, it was confusing for New Zealanders to understand which agency was responsible for what, and exactly what their lawful powers and capabilities were.\nThe reviewers concluded that a  single Act  was necessary to overcome these issues. They commented that a single Act would:\n give a comprehensive and much clearer view of the agencies' functions and powers, and the checks and balances that apply to the operation of their powers    and  would avoid inconsistencies and gaps between various statutes and enable a consistent set of fundamental principles to be applied to the agencies and their oversight . \nUnderstandably, drawing the two bodies together would make it easier for them to co-operate and work together when required.\nAnother issue concerning to the reviewers was the lack of security protection available to New Zealanders under the prevailing legislation. The most recent piece of legislation dealing with intelligence and surveillance was enacted some 47 years ago, the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service Act 1969.

It has a round body and three or four metal strings.\nName\nAccording to A. S. Famintsyn, domra is the russified form of Arabic tanbura.\nHistory\nThe first known written mention of the domra is in Admonitions of Metropolitan Daniel (1530). This musical instrument gained great popularity in the 16th 17th centuries, replacing the gusli. There are numerous mentions of the domra in historic documents of this period. For instance, Alphabet (1654), in the Moscow Synodal Library, says:  As to what musikiia is: Musikiia, playing, that is, the sounding of gusli and kiniry, or lyres, and domry, and similar things . \nIn addition, medieval Russian illuminated manuscripts of the Psalter contain images of musicians with necked plucked-string instruments, and some of those miniatures are clearly captioned  depiction of domras . Judging by those images, late medieval Russian domry can be divided into two types: lute-shaped, which had five to six strings, a large body and а pegbox angled back, and tanbur-shaped, which had three to four strings, a small body and a straight peg",

According to the edict:\nWhenever domras appear, they should be confiscated and, after those objects of demonic games are broken, burned. And people who play them should be beaten and sent to the end of our state.\nIn 1896, a student of Vasily Vasilievich Andreyev found a broken instrument in a stable in rural Russia. It was thought that this instrument may have been an example of a domra, although at that time no illustrations or examples of the traditional domra were known to exist (the traditional domra was only known through numerous mentions in folklore, though examples existed of the dombra, a related Turkic instrument). A three-stringed version of this instrument was later redesigned in 1896, patented, and introduced into the orchestra of Russian folk instruments.\nOrchestral instruments\nThe basic domra is tuned as follows:\nThree strings: EAD tuning.\nFour strings: GDAE tuning (like",

    "text": "In the textile arts, plying (from the French verb plier,  to fold , from the Latin verb plico, from the ancient Greek verb πλέκω.) is a process of twisting one or more strings (called strands or plies) of yarn together to create a stronger yarn. Strands are twisted together in the direction opposite that in which they were spun. Plied yarns will not unravel, break, or degrade as easily as unplied yarns. When enough twist is added to the plies to counter the initial twist of each strand, the resulting yarn is  balanced , having no tendency to twist upon itself. \nThe number of strands used to make the yarn is usually the same as the number of plies it has. Two-ply yarn means two strands were used, three-ply yarn means three strands were used, etc. Embroidery floss is generally a six-ply yarn, for example. There are some exceptions to this, most notably in chain plying.\nPlying handspun yarns\nThere are two common ways to ply a balanced yarn: regular and chain plying. \nBoth methods involve the manipulation of  singles  unplied strands on their own into multiple-ply yarns by applying twist in the opposite direction than how the single was spun. For example, if in spinning the single the wheel was spinning clockwise (called a  Z  twist, as on any given side the fibres appear to cross",

For example, if in spinning the single the wheel was spinning clockwise (called a  Z  twist, as on any given side the fibres appear to cross each other like the line in the middle of the letter  Z ), the wheel must spin counter-clockwise (an  S  twist) in order to ply it.\nRegular plying\nRegular plying consists of taking 2 or more singles and twisting them together. This can be done on either a spinning wheel or a spindle.\nWhen plying, the singles are kept separate, either with the fingers or with a tool. This tool can be anything from the top of a salt dispenser, and the singles threaded through the holes, or a specially carved piece of wood with holes in it. The singles are kept separate to ensure that they do not get tangled and so the tension can be controlled.\nMost spinners who use spinning wheels ply from bobbins or spools. This is easier than plying from balls because there is less chance for the yarn to become tangled and knotted. So that the bobbins can unwind freely, they are put in a device called a Lazy Kate, or sometimes simply kate. The simplest lazy kate consists of wooden bars with a metal rod running between them. Most hold three or four bobbins. The bobbin sits on the metal rod. Other lazy kates are built with devices that",

Other lazy kates are built with devices that create an adjustable amount of tension, which adds control to how much string is unwound using a given amount of force. Some spinning wheels come with a built-in lazy kate. \nOn a drop spindle, two-ply is created by placing the spools on a lazy kate, tying the ends together onto the drop spindle, holding equal lengths of singles together and dropping the spindle. The weight of the drop spindle, combined with the twist in the singles, causes the drop spindle to turn in the opposite direction that the singles were twisted in until the two singles are plied together.\nChain plying\nChain plying (also known as Navajo plying) consists of making large loops, similar to crocheting. Only one single is necessary, and if the single is already dyed, this technique allows it to be plied without changing the color scheme. \nThe spinner first makes a loop on the end of the leader the string left on the bobbin, which the new yarn is spun from that is large enough to slip their hand through. They pull some of the working yarn through the loop. Then the spinner starts applying twist to the three plies, consisting of the two sides of the loop together with the yarn pulled through",

Then the spinner starts applying twist to the three plies, consisting of the two sides of the loop together with the yarn pulled through it. When the loop and the yarn are nearly fully plied together, a new loop of yarn is pulled through the initial loop, and spinning continues. This process is repeated until the yarn is all plied. This technique allows the spinner to try to match up thick and thin spots in the yarn, thus making for a smoother end product.\nCenter-pull ball plying\nCenter-pull ball plying results in yarn similar in appearance to regular plying. However, it doesn t require a lazy kate or multiple bobbins. It requires a single bobbin and a center-pull ball winder or a nostepinne to create the center-pull ball that is plied with.\nOnce the ball is wound, the single from both the center and outside are held together, in a similar manner to the regular plying method, then twisted together. This results in a two-ply yarn.\nCenter-pull ball plying results in one single being more tightly wound than the other, causing a fluffier and looser texture when knit, compared to the regular plying method.\nMachined yarns\nMachines that ply yarn use the 'regular' method mentioned above.

The main difference is that gears control the intake, making sure that the strands all have the same tension and the same length. Other than that, the process for plying is exactly the same as when hand done.\nNovelty yarns\nMany novelty yarns make use of special plying techniques to gain their special effects. By varying the tension in the strands, or the relative sizes of the strands, or many other factors different effects can be achieved. For example, when a soft, thick strand is plied against a tightly twisted thin strand, the resulting yarn spirals. Another example is bouclé, which is a yarn where one strand is held loosely and allowed to make loops on the other yarn while plying.\nSee also\nRope\nReferences\nBibliography\nAbby Franquemont, Respect the Spindle, spin infinite yarns with one amazing tool, Interweave (2009) ISBN 9781596681552, pp100 111.\n   External links",

It is a remake of the Bengali film Saat Pake Bandha (1963).\nPlot\nBharathi is the daughter of retired principal Appa Rao, with values and self-esteem. She and lecturer Chandrashekar fall in love. Bharathi's mother, Manikyamba, does not like this alliance because of its prestige. But Appa Rao convinces her and arranges the marriage of Chandrashekar and Bharathi. After the wedding, Manikyamba constantly criticizes Chandrashekar, so he leaves their house with Bharathi and they live happily. Manikyamba dislikes her daughter's middle-class life. She starts boasting about her son-in-law to the relatives. This hurts Chandrashekar, so he does not want to return to her house, and Bharathi is sandwiched between her mother and husband. Gradually, ego clashes arise between the couple, and they lose tolerance for each other and separate with the intention of divorcing.

It is in the family Mustelidae and is the lone member of the genus Poecilogale. It has a long, slender body with short legs and a bushy tail. One of the smallest carnivorans in Africa, it measures 24 to 35 cm (9.4 to 13.8 in) long excluding the tail, with males generally larger than females. It has black fur over most of its body, with distinctive white bands running from the top of its head down its back, with the tail being completely white. The closest living relative of this species is the striped polecat, and it may also be related to the extinct Propoecilogale bolti.\nThe African striped weasel is most commonly seen in savanna and veld grasslands with termite mounds, but has also been recorded in semideserts, rainforests, fynbos and even areas used by humans such as pine plantations and agricultural land. It is a powerful digger and excavates burrows which it inhabits. Though not commonly seen, it has been listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because of its wide range and habitat",

There are no known major threats to the species, though it is commonly used in local traditional medicine. Owls and domestic dogs are known to prey on it, and weasels sometimes die in fights against each other. This weasel generally flees from any perceived threats, but may try warding off its attacker with noises, fake charges or a noxious fluid sprayed from its perineal glands.\nAfrican striped weasels are specialized predators that feed almost entirely on rodents, though they occasionally eat birds as well. Even when hungry, they ignore other types of small animals and eggs provided to it as food. This animal commonly bites its prey in the back of the neck while rolling around or kicking the prey's back, likely in an attempt to dislocate the neck. Larger prey may instead be dispatched with bites to the throat, though only females have been observed doing this. This weasel rarely drinks water, only doing so in small quantities when the weather is hot. It is mostly a nocturnal and solitary animal, though small groups of up to four individuals are sometimes seen.

Breeding takes place from spring to the end of summer, and two to three young tend to be born per litter after a gestation period of about 30 days.\nTaxonomy and evolution\nThe African striped weasel was first described in 1864, when British zoologist John Edward Gray studied a skin of the animal purchased by the British Museum ten years earlier that was labeled as that of a  zorilla . He recognized that this skin was unlike that of any other known member of the mustelid family, and determined that it represented a new species which he named Zorilla albinucha. The specific name combines the Latin words albi meaning 'white' and nucha meaning 'nape'. Five years later, Gray published a catalogue of some of the mammal specimens in the British Museum, in which he moved the species into the genus Mustela as Mustela albinucha, commenting that it only has the colouration of a zorilla. In 1883, another British zoologist, Oldfield Thomas, noticed that the species had significant differences in the skull compared to any known mustelid genera. He therefore established the new genus Poecilogale, the sole included species being Poecilogale albinucha. The generic name is derived from the Ancient Greek words poikilos (ποικίλος), meaning 'particol",

The generic name is derived from the Ancient Greek words poikilos (ποικίλος), meaning 'particoloured' or 'cunning', and galē (γαλῆ), meaning 'weasel'. Thomas' study was based on five African striped weasel specimens, four of which were kept in the British Museum, with the remaining one in the Paris Museum of Natural History.\nIn 1865, German naturalist Wilhelm Peters reported two mustelid specimens from Golungo Alto, Angola. He described one of them as a new species which he named Zorilla africana, and thought the other should also be considered a variety of this species. However, Austrian explorer Friedrich Welwitsch told him that the latter specimen represents the species named a year earlier as Zorilla albinucha. Welwitsch believed that the two forms were consistently different, and that even the local indigenous population refers to them by different names. In the same year, Portuguese zoologist José Vicente Barbosa du Bocage studied two skins and a skeleton of African striped weasels from Calandula, Angola and proposed that the animal's scientific name be changed to Zorilla flavistriata. Both Zorilla africana and Zorilla flavistriata are no longer deemed valid names, and are now considered",

Some authors believe that the species is monotypic and that all proposed subspecies should be considered invalid. The following five subspecies were recognized in the third edition of Mammal Species of the World, published in 2005:\nEvolution\nThe African striped weasel is the only species in the monotypic genus Poecilogale, which belongs in the subfamily Ictonychinae within the family Mustelidae. Ictonychinae is divided into two tribes, Ictonychini and Lyncodontini. This species is part of Ictonychini, which it shares with the striped polecat, Saharan striped polecat and marbled polecat. Genetic analyses indicate that the closest living relative of the African striped weasel is the striped polecat, with the two being recovered as sister taxa in multiple studies.

The following cladogram shows the position of the African striped weasel among its closest living relatives according to Gray et al., (2022):\nA fossil species, Propoecilogale bolti, was originally named as a member of the genus Ictonyx, but has been placed in a separate genus since 1987. It shows features in its skull and teeth that are intermediate between Ictonyx and Poecilogale, and has been suggested to be an ancestor of the African striped weasel. Fossil specimens of Propoecilogale have been found in the Late Pliocene and Early Pleistocene-aged cave deposits of South Africa, suggesting the animal existed between 2.6 and 1.4 million years ago.\nDescription\nOne of the smallest carnivorans found in Africa (along with the dwarf mongoose), the African striped weasel has a slender body and short legs, and is the proportionally longest mammal native to the continent.

Considering the increase in sightings from regions formerly believed to be unsuitable for them (such as in southwestern South Africa in 1998), the weasel may be more widespread than previously thought. It commonly lives below 1,500 m (4,921 ft) elevation, but may occasionally be found as high as 2,200 m (7,218 ft).\nBehaviour and ecology\nThe African striped weasel is a mostly nocturnal animal, though it can sometimes be found at dawn or dusk. This species walks with a distinctive gait, with the body stretched out or arched while the snout is held low to the ground, swinging the front part of its body from side to side in a snake-like manner. It regularly stops to stand on its hind legs so that it can survey its surroundings.

However, they may sometimes rest in natural cavities such as hollow logs or rock crevices. They defecate in well-defined latrine locations, raising their tails almost vertically when doing so, possibly as a means of scent marking. In the wild, these latrines are commonly at the bases of trees and termite mounds, whereas captive animals may deposit dung against a vertical wall instead. Captive females with nursing young have been recorded to dip their necks into water during very hot weather, which may be to both cool themselves and carry water so that they can moisten and cool their young.\nSocial behaviour and communication\nAfrican striped weasels are generally solitary, but may occasionally be seen in pairs or family groups of up to four individuals. Males are aggressive when they encounter one another, at first bristling up the hair on their tails, making short cries and fake charges, and then escalating to fighting with bites, thrashing, and aggressive shrieks if neither individual retreats. The species has been identified as making six different calls.

While they occasionally feed on reptiles, insects, and eggs, in experiments conducted during the 1970s, captive striped weasels did not attack or eat several genera of invertebrates (including various insects), reptiles, amphibians and chicken eggs offered to them, even while hungry. The weasels hunt primarily by scent, attacking prey with a sudden lunge and biting onto the back of the neck. After the initial strike, they roll around and kick the prey animal's back or pelvic region, perhaps in order to dislocate the prey's neck (as suggested in 1978 by South African researcher David T. Rowe-Rowe). When taking on larger prey such as rats, which can weigh more than the weasels themselves, adult female weasels bite at the throat instead, though males have not been recorded doing this. Prey is generally eaten",

When taking on larger prey such as rats, which can weigh more than the weasels themselves, adult female weasels bite at the throat instead, though males have not been recorded doing this. Prey is generally eaten whole while the weasel is in a crouched pose, though the feathers and legs of birds and the stomachs of mammals are sometimes left uneaten. Unlike the related striped polecat, this species does not use its front limbs to stabilize its food while eating. Although African striped weasels eat smaller prey weighing up to 180 g (6.3 oz) head first, larger prey is eaten from the shoulder first. They sometimes store prey in their burrow instead of eating it immediately, picking up small prey by the back skin off the ground and dragging larger prey backwards towards the storage area. The gut of an African striped weasel is between 1.75 and 2 times the length of its body excluding the tail, and food passes through rather quickly, with defecation occurring approximately 165 minutes after the food was consumed.\nThey do not drink frequently, gaining most of their moisture requirements through their food. When they do drink, they do so by lapping up water with their tongues. A male kept in a cage for two weeks during the winter did not drink almost any water during this time, only occasionally drinking small amounts of water during hot weather.\nReproduction\nThe breeding season of the African striped weasel is",

A male kept in a cage for two weeks during the winter did not drink almost any water during this time, only occasionally drinking small amounts of water during hot weather.\nReproduction\nThe breeding season of the African striped weasel is extensive, lasting from spring to the end of summer. The testes of the male remain large from September to April (spring to early autumn) and are shrunken for the rest of the year. A soft chattering sound, believed to be a greeting call, is emitted by the male when courting a female during this time. If the female is receptive, she may express her receptiveness by moving around him. The male will then gently chew on her cheek, sniff her vulva and hold onto her neck from behind. During mating, the male continues to grip the female's neck from behind while clutching his forelimbs around her pelvic region. The duration of copulation is variable and can be as short as 27 minutes, though it typically lasts between 60 and 80 minutes. At least three bouts of copulation can occur within a day. Females raise the young with no aid from the males and give birth to one litter per year of two or three young after a gestation period of about 30 days, though they may have a second litter if the first is lost early.\nBirth takes place in a burrow during the daytime, and the mother eats the placenta afterwards.

They are almost hairless, with their pink skin visible over most of the body, a mane of white hair on the back of the head, and a hump which stretches from the back of the head to the shoulders. Their mother carries them by this hump until it and the mane disappear at seven weeks, at which point she carries them by the scruff of the neck instead. Newborns have closed eyes and ears, making them blind and deaf, despite the eye slits and pinnae (ear flaps) already being present. Their skin becomes dark at seven days old, and the prominent black and white colouration of the species develops at 28 days old. Their milk canine teeth grow out at five weeks, at which point they begin eating the soft parts of prey killed by their mother, with permanent canines growing at 11 weeks before the milk canines are shed. Their eyes open at an age of 51 to 54 days. By 11 weeks of age they are weaned (stop drinking milk), and they start killing their own prey at 13 weeks.

Tuberculosis of the spleen is a common cause of death in some captive weasels. They are also known to kill each other in intraspecific fights (fights with others of their species). Documented predators of wild individuals include owls and domestic dogs, with humans also sometimes trapping and killing them when they visit chicken houses or to use them in traditional medicine. Some fall victim to vehicular collisions, as evidenced by roadkill carcasses found in agricultural areas. The tapeworm Taenia brachyacantha is also a known parasite of the species.\nWhen startled, African striped weasels attempt to flee by escaping into a hole, or (according to anecdotal evidence) occasionally by climbing up trees. If unable to flee, the animal may emit a sound similar to a growl or shriek while raising its tail and making fake charges at the perceived threat. If this fails, the weasel may spray a yellowish, musky fluid from its perineal glands that can be ejected up to 1 m (3 ft 3 in) away. Though this fluid",

The IUCN did not make any population estimates for the species, simply stating that the number of mature individuals is unknown, but notes that it is  rare to uncommon . It is not known to face any major threats, even though it is one of the most regularly used species in local traditional medicine. In addition, its skin is used as a good luck charm.

Examples of Green development are green infrastructure, LEED, conservation development, and sustainability developments.\nReal estate in itself has been measured as a contributing factor to the rise in green house gases. According to the International Energy Agency, real estate in 2019 was responsible for 39 percent of total emissions worldwide and 11 percent of those emissions were due to the manufacturing of materials used in buildings.\nDevelopment\nReal estate development involves planning and coordinating of housebuilding, real estate construction or renovation projects. Real estate development can be less cyclical than real estate investing.\nInvestment\nIn markets where land and building prices are rising, real estate is often purchased as an investment, whether or not the owner intends to use the property. Often investment properties are rented out, but  flipping  involves quickly reselling a property, sometimes taking advantage of arbitrage or quickly rising value, and sometimes after repairs are made that substantially raise the value of the property. Luxury real estate is sometimes used as a way to store value, especially by wealthy foreigners, without any particular attempt to rent it out. Some luxury units in London and New York City have been used as a way for corrupt foreign government officials and business people from countries without strong rule of law to launder money or to protect it from seizure. Investment in real estate can be categorized by financial risk into core, value-added, and opportunistic. Real estate value tends to depreciate with age according to hedonic regression.\nProfessionals\nReal estate agent   North America\nEstate agent   United Kingdom\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\n The dictionary definition of real estate at Wiktionary\n Quotations related to Real estate at Wikiquote",

Talking about the resemblance, Sajid stated:  I won't deny any influence in our work, but I am not sure to what extent it goes . According to him the lyrics and the vibe of the song are similar, though the tune is different. The song was talked for its similarity with many tracks performed by Govinda.\nThe song is directed by David Dhawan who is contributed by his elder son, Rohit. The lyrics of the song is penned by Kausar Munir who stated;   To crack this very simple yet catchy and populist vibe is hard, and I don't understand the game of hits and flops . Additional lyrics of the song is penned by Danish Sabri. Since the song required Dhawan to involve a lot of heavy duty steps on the ground with body weight balanced on the hands solely and to avoid any injuries to his wrist and hand, he suggested wearing biker's gloves.\nThe promotional released music video features, Nargis Fakhri through various snippets from the film and songs like  Galat Baat Hai  and  Shanivaar Raat .

The film stars Eleonora Fani, Jennifer Mischiati, Bruce Payne, and Per Fredrik Åsly in the lead roles, and features guest appearances by Gérard Depardieu and William Shatner. The story is about how the destinies of mankind are being manipulated by a race of powerful extraterrestrials known as the Creators. \nThe film was announced as the first part of a planned trilogy, whose next two installments would have been Creators: The Present and Creators: The Future. Principal photography began in 2014, but the film did not reach theaters before 2020. Its release in Italy suffered from the COVID-19 pandemic and it flopped at the box office. The film later generated some curiosity in Italy due to the script's allusions to conspiracy theories.\nPlot\nThe film provides a fictional explanation as to why the Mayan prophecy did not come to pass. As the end of the year 2012 arrives, the universe is about to undergo an extraordinary planetary alignment which will cause a total eclipse to be visible from planet Earth.

Locations included the province of Biella and the historical area of Canavese in Piedmont, as well as the Aosta Valley and Venice. Some scenes were filmed at the Verrès Castle and the Castle Savoia. The city of Biella and its province were actively involved in the making of the film, for which they provided locations as well as funding. The film's production also received support from the province's Confederation of Industry branch. Gérard Depardieu's involvement in the production reportedly played an important role in gaining support from public authorities in the Biella province. Michel J. Vandewalle, who had been an executive producer on Iron Sky (2012), worked on the film in a similar capacity.\nThe film's budget was reported to be about 8 million euros.

In 2021, after the film had been completed and released, the ministry granted the production company an incentive of about 389,000 euros, plus 71,000 euros to compensate for the COVID-related difficulties. \nPrincipal photography started in 2014.

The film, originally slated for a release in February 2016, remained unreleased at that date. In December 2017, director Zaia said that the film was  almost ready  for worldwide distribution and that it had been delayed in part due to the extensive use of green screen and special effects, and to the addition of new scenes involving new actors.

Some sources say it earned between 120,000 and 130,000 euros before its release was cut short by the resurging COVID-19 pandemic. The revenue for the producers, after deduction of ticket sales fees, was reported to be a mere 47,000 euros.\nIn January 2021, director Piergiuseppe Zaia stated that despite the film's aborted release, he and Fani were working on what would be the second installment of the trilogy. However, his production company, Artuniverse, was liquidated in December 2023 due to its inability to generate revenues.

She went on to publish geopolitical content that praised Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, and to promote QAnon-influenced conspiracy theories.\nIn 2025, several private investors who had participated in the film's funding filed a complaint against Zaia, Fani, and a banker who had organised the fundraising, saying that they had been defrauded.

It is orbited by one confirmed exoplanet, super-Jupiter HD 18742 b (proper name Bagan), and possibly by another Jovian planetary candidate (HD 18742 c).\nStellar characteristics\nHD 18742 is a yellow subgiant star with a spectral type of G8 K0 IV. Its physical parameters vary from publication to publication, with calculated radii ranging between 4.08 6.34 R , and mass estimates falling mostly between 1.36 1.73 M , though a 2017 paper suggests a significantly higher value of 2.58 0.24 M . The star has an effective temperature of about 5,000 K (4,730  C; 8,540  F) and a luminosity of 13.2 or 20.7 L , and is thought to be about 2.3 2.5 billion years old. Seen from Earth, the star has an apparent magnitude of 7.81, making it visible with binoculars and by the naked eye under the darkest skies with effort.\nNomenclature\nIn 2019, the Republic of the Union of Myanmar was assigned to giving the HD 18742 system a proper name as part",

Names were submitted and selected within Myanmar, which were then presented to the IAU to be officially recognized. On 17 December 2019, the IAU announced that HD 18742 and its confirmed planet, b, were named Ayeyarwady and Bagan, respectively.\nAyeyarwady was named after a river of the same name, the longest and most important river in Myanmar. Bagan refers to one of the ancient cities of the country located right beside the Ayeyarwady, which was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2019.\nPlanetary system\nIn 2011, radial-velocity observations made at the W. M. Keck Observatory revealed the existence of one exoplanet around HD 18742. The planet, HD 18742, is thought to be a gas giant with a minimum mass of 3.362 MJ, which orbits its host star at a distance of 1.82 AU once every 766 days",

The planet, HD 18742, is thought to be a gas giant with a minimum mass of 3.362 MJ, which orbits its host star at a distance of 1.82 AU once every 766 days (2.10 years). Its orbit is nearly circular (i.e., with a low eccentricity), similar to planets in the Solar System.\nOther than the doppler shifts caused by HD 18742 b, radial-velocity measurements used to discover the planet also included an additional linear trend. Utilizing data gathered at the Keck Observatory between 2007 and 2015, Luhn et al. subtracted the effects of HD 18742 b from the radial-velocity curve, revealing a 900-day-period signal, possibly caused by another similar planet. Though the existence of such a planet would provide a far better match to the observed curve, this signal remains a planetary candidate since it would be in a 9:10 resonance with HD 18742 b, a non-physical resonance that is previously unheard of. Follow-up observations are expected to show the true nature of the system.\nSee also\nList of proper names of stars\nList of proper names of exoplanets\nList of stars in Eridanus\nList of exoplanets discovered in 2011\nReferences\nExternal links\nJean Schneider.

Kaiser-class underway replenishment oiler operated by the Military Sealift Command to support ships of the United States Navy.\nGuadalupe, the fourteenth ship of the Henry J. Kaiser class, was laid down at Avondale Shipyard, Inc., at New Orleans, Louisiana, on 9 July 1990 and launched on 5 October 1991. She entered non-commissioned U.S. Navy service under the control of the Military Sealift Command with a primarily civilian crew on 25 September 1992. She serves in the United States Pacific Fleet. In June 2004, USNS Guadalupe rescued 13 crew and a dog from the burning Taiwanese fishing vessel Hsin Chin Chanz, around 900 miles north east of Guam in the Pacific.\nDesign\nThe Henry J. Kaiser-class replenishment oilers were preceded by the shorter Cimarron class. Guadalupe has an overall length of 206.5 metres (677 ft 6 in). It has a beam of 29.7 metres (97 ft) and a draft of 11 metres (36 ft). The oiler has a displacement of 41,353 tonnes (40,700 long tons; 45,584 short tons) at full load.

It can carry a dry load of 690 square metres (7,400 sq ft) and can refrigerate 128 pallets of food. The ship is powered by two 10 PC4.2 V 570 Colt-Pielstick diesel engines that drive two shafts; this gives a power of 25.6 megawatts (34,800 PS; 34,300 shp).\nThe Henry J. Kaiser-class oilers have maximum speeds of 20 knots (37 km h; 23 mph). They were built without armaments but can be fitted with close-in weapon systems. The ship has a helicopter platform but not any maintenance facilities. It is fitted with five fuelling stations; these can fill two ships at the same time and the ship is capable of pumping 900,000 US gallons (3,400,000 L; 750,000 imp gal) of diesel or 540,000 US gallons (2,000,000 L; 450,000 imp gal) of jet fuel per hour.

It was the site of many notable events, as well as being a residence for a few dozen people over the years. DUMBA was a unique experiment providing a combination of live music and disc jockeys (usually several DJs a night), film screenings of Super 8 and 16mm films, video, artwork, performances, vegetarian food, and an unrestricted erotic atmosphere.\nBackground and history\nDUMBA was founded in a loft, during the summer of 1996 by a group of people which included filmmaker Scott Berry, Kelly Besser, Vincent Baker, and others. It would come to call itself the  DUMBA Collective  by around 2000.\nThe group's name, DUMBA, is derived from DUMBO, the neighborhood between Fulton Landing and Vinegar Hill.\nThe 5,000-square-foot (460 m2) loft used for the collective's space was commercially zoned under the Manhattan Bridge overpass and housed six or seven residents between the years 1996 and 2006.

Diana Morrow designed several of the flyers. Bands and performers who played DUMBA include The Need, Los Crudos, Limp Wrist, Nedra Johnson, The Spaceheads, Bitch and Animal, Octant, God Is My Co-Pilot, Tribe 8, Three Dollar Bill, Kaia, Patsy, The Lookers, and many more. In time, the venue began to feature more diverse performances by artists such as Vaginal Davis.\nFuck the Mayor Collective\nDUMBA was also involved in the Fuck the Mayor Collective, a queer activist organization created in response to what some believed were the racist, classist, sexist, and homophobic policies of the Giuliani administration. In 1998, DUMBA and the Fuck the Mayor Collective created Gay Shame, a controversial anti-assimilationist and anti-consumerism response to the annual Gay Pride celebrations during June.

The event was written about by Alissa Chadburn in the San Francisco Bay Guardian:\nThe goal of Gay Shame in New York was to form a free  non-consumerist space for creating culture and community building  and to try to  build some opposition to the reactionary gay mainstream,  which  Mattilda  says has  a stranglehold on all representations of queerness in the media.\nThe collective behind Gay Shame also produced a fanzine each year for the occasion of the event, entitled Swallow Your Pride. Gay Shame was held at DUMBA in June 1998 and June 2000 (June 17, 2000).\nQueeruption, 1999\nThe second iteration of Queeruption, an annual international Queercore festival, was largely housed at DUMBA October 7 11, 1999.

There was also a Columbus Day action in Central Park in which city vehicles were  ticketed  for parking on stolen land, and to protest the arrest of a gay man, allegedly for cruising in the park (he claimed to be urinating).\nBrooklyn Babylon Cinema\nBrooklyn Babylon Cinema, a recurring analog film screening series, was born at DUMBA and continued for several years. It featured events such as the  Times Square Sinema  on May 7, 1999, which provided a kissing booth and encouraged fraternization; a tribute to the Deuce's seedy past; and  Caught Looking  (March 2000), a program about voyeurism curated by Aaron Scott, which included two video programs, as well as installations by Rob Roth and others.

His family emigrated to Canada in 1910 and he attended secondary school in Saskatoon, going on to the University of Saskatchewan, where he was awarded BA in 1927. He began working for the YMCA as boys  work secretary in Saskatoon in 1922, later becoming an Army physical education instructor. At the outbreak of World War II he went with the 1st Canadian Division to England as a YMCA Auxiliary Service officer, returning later on to Canada to train others.\nWar service\nIn 1941 Porteous was posted with the Winnipeg Grenadiers to Hong Kong, to reinforce the British garrison. The regiment arrived just in time to be overwhelmed by invading Japanese forces, and Porteous was to spend a total of 44 months in one of the notorious prisoner of war camps, where he remained until the end of the war. In due course he was decorated as an MBE, Member of the Order of the British Empire, for his outstanding contribution in maintaining prisoner morale while imprisoned.\nHonours\nPorteous returned to Saskatoon after the war and was named executive director of the Saskatoon Community Chest. He was later awarded the Order of Canada",

He died in office on 6 February 1978.\nMedical research\nAn interesting insight into Porteous' experience is that from 1960 until his death in 1978 Porteous was an enthusiastic advocate of the medical benefits of niacin. Dr. Abram Hoffer had approached him to request that he recommend it to the senior citizens in the social housing development which Porteous administered. Hoffer believed large doses of niacin, up to six grams a day, could retard the development and even reverse senility, as it dilates the blood vessels, thus improving circulation.\nPorteous insisted he would not recommend anything to anyone which he had not first tried himself. For six months, he took the six grams a day and then recommended it to the senior citizens without reservation. As he told the Department of Veterans Affairs doctor on his next annual visit (he was on a 100  disability pension) that he had not felt as well since before the war; he could even touch his hands together above his head, not having been able to raise them above his shoulders before the treatment. He discovered that niacin had greatly relieved the severe arthritis and insomnia that had plagued him as a result of his wartime imprisonment and systematic starvation over a four-year period. He supported the use of this vitamin for all Canadian and US ex-prisoners of war suffering from similar symptoms.\nBibliography\nHoffer, Abram (2008), Orthomolecular Medicine for Everyone: Megavitamin Therapeutics for Families and Physicians (Vol 2), Laguna Beach, California: Basic Health Publications, ISBN 978-1-59120-226-4\nReferences\nExternal links\nPorteous, George Archived 2011-01-24 at the Wayback Machine, Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan",

    "text": "Kristina Wong, Sweatshop Overlord is a 2021 American play by Kristina Wong. Its premise is based on Wong's experience organizing hundreds of volunteers to sew masks amid the COVID-19 pandemic, calling themselves the  Auntie Sewing Squad . Over the course of the play, Wong uses comedy to address themes such as the often unattainable nature of the American Dream, anti-Asian racism in the U.S. caused by the pandemic, and the invisible labor of women and people and color. The play was a finalist for the 2022 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, and won the Lucille Lortel Award, Drama Desk Award, and Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Solo Show.\nSynopsis\nDuring the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, Kristina Wong begins sewing masks from old bedsheets and bra straps on her Hello Kitty sewing machine. She quickly organizes the Auntie Sewing Squad, a network of hundreds of volunteers including children and her mother working from home to produce masks and address gaps in the U.S. public health system. As the project grows, Wong reflects on the blurred line between mutual aid and cult-like dedication.\nAs demand for masks declines and pandemic restrictions ease, Wong navigates life after leading the group, exploring the challenges of rebuilding personal and communal connections. The performance combines humor and generosity, inviting the audience to witness Wong s efforts to foster community during isolation while reflecting on the pandemic s broader social impact.\nProduction history\nThe play was",

It would be produced and directed by Richard Fleischer.\nThe book came out in October 1969 and became a best seller. The New York Times called it  impossible to put down. \nRuss Meyer\nFleischer withdrew, and the movie was assigned to Russ Meyer, who had directed Beyond the Valley of the Dolls for Fox. Fox was happy with the movie and signed a contract with Meyer to make three more movies: The Seven Minutes, from a novel by Irving Wallace; Everything in the Garden from a play by Edward Albee; and The Final Steal from a 1966 novel by Peter George.

In addressing the movie's use of nudity, he wrote   Meyer  has never been so much concerned with undressing his girls (there are maybe five seconds of nudity in  The Seven Minutes ) as admiring their appetites, their overwhelming proportions (but not so much their seductive flesh), their often destructive and self-destructive wills. \nVariety wrote that Irving Wallace's original novel was a  potboiler   which averted the essence of the problem in resolving the story , and noted that Russ Meyer was a  censor-exploited as well as a",

A charge imposed by the state of Victoria on zero and low emission vehicles (ZLEVs) was ruled invalid on the grounds that it imposed a duty of excise as defined by Section 90 of the Constitution. It overruled Dickenson's Arcade Pty Ltd v Tasmania, and imposed a broad view of an excise as defined by Section 90.\nFacts\nThe Zero and Low Emission Vehicle Distance-based Charge Act 2021, which came into effect on 1 July 2021, imposed a charge on the use of electric, hydrogen, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (collectively referred to as ZLEVs) on Victorian roads. The charge was 2.5 cents per kilometre for electric and hydrogen vehicles, and 2.0 cents per kilometre for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. The charge was introduced to ensure ZLEV owners paid for the maintenance of the road network, as ZLEVs would not be subject to the fuel excise.\nIn September of 2021, Melbourne ZLEV drivers Chris Vanderstock and Kathleen Davies, represented by Equity Generation Lawyers, launched a challenge against the constitutional validity of the law, arguing that the Victorian law created a tax of consumption on ZLEVs, which would be a duty of excise and exclusive to the Commonwealth under Section 90 of the Constitution.\nDecision\nA narrow majority of the Court, consisting of Kiefel CJ",

The majority ruled that Dickenson's Arcade Pty Ltd v Tasmania, which held that a tax on goods at the stage of consumption did not constitute an excise, should be reopened and overruled. Kiefel CJ, Gageler, and Gleeson JJs found that the nature of Victoria's ZLEV charge would inherently  dampen demand  for ZLEVs, as the charge applied to almost all uses of ZLEVs on Victorian roads, and therefore the Victorian charge was a tax and a duty of excise.\nJagot J, concurring with the Court's ruling, agreed that the Victorian ZLEV charge was a tax, and thus could not be imposed on the state level, distinguishing it from a  fee for service , such as a license or permit fee.\nGordon, Edelman, and Steward JJs all disagreed with the Court's opinion, authoring separate dissents.

All three dissenting justices agreed that Dickenson's Arcade should not have been reopened.\nReaction\nPlaintiffs Vanderstock and Davies welcomed the Court's ruling, stating that Victoria's ZLEV charge had disincentivised the purchase of ZLEVs and unfairly punished ZLEV drivers. Upon the announcement of the Court's ruling, the Victorian Greens and Victorian shadow treasurer Brad Rowswell called upon the Victorian government to repay charges claimed under the Zero and Low Emission Vehicle Distance-based Charge Act 2021.\nThe Court's ruling was immediately noted to have severely effected the vertical fiscal imbalance between the Commonwealth and the states. Similar charges planned to be introduced by New South Wales and Western Australia were likely prohibited, and the constitutionality of other state-imposed road user charges, such as motor vehicle duties and vehicle registration charges, could be brought into question. Every state and territory government had submitted in support of Victoria in the case.\nVictorian treasurer Tim Pallas argued that the Court had redefined an excise to mean  a tax on anything , suggesting that other state charges could be challenged under the Court's ruling. He emphasised the need to  secure the state s revenue base  through legislative changes and collaboration with the Commonwealth. New South Wales Premier Chris Minns stated that the decision in Vanderstock had  caught everyone off guard , adding that the funding of future road projects in New South Wales may have to be re-examined due to the state's reliance on road user charges.\nPallas announced in November 2023 that the ZLEV charges imposed would be repaid with interest, amounting to an approximate A 7 million repayment to ZLEV owners.\nSee also\nSection 90 of the Constitution of Australia\nAustralian constitutional law\nReferences\nExternal links\n 2023  HCA 30 (Vanderstock v Victoria) - Judgement",

These areas of descending air are thought to be essential in the production of many supercellular tornadoes. Large hail within the rear flank downdraft often shows up brightly as a hook on weather radar images, producing the characteristic hook echo, which often indicates the presence of a tornado.\nFormation\nThe rear flank downdraft can arise owing to negative buoyancy, which can be generated by cold anomalies produced at the rear of the supercell thunderstorm by evaporative cooling of precipitation or hail melting, or injection of dry and cooler air in the cloud, and by vertical perturbation pressure gradients that can arise from vertical gradients of vertical vorticity, stagnation of environmental flow at an updraft, and pressure perturbations due to vertical buoyancy variations (which are partially due to hydrostatic effects).\nVertical pressure perturbations are generated by the buildup of pressure due to the vertical buoyancy, creating a pressure perturbation gradient. The subsiding air is generally dry and as it subsides the air warms adiabatically and can form a clearing in the cloud cover called a clear slot. A clear slot can be observed to wrap around a tornado or form away from a tornado in the shape of a horseshoe.

This clearing is most likely the formation of the hook echo region associated with tornado formation. An RFD originating in dry air warming adiabatically can produce warmer observations out of the RFD at the surface.\nThermodynamic characteristics\nRFDs may present themselves as a clear slot wrapping itself at least two-thirds of the way around the tornado, but the clear slot is not always evident in cases where an RFD is present. Many documents indicate that surface pressure excesses up to a few millibars exist within RFDs. Some findings showed that within the RFDs equivalent potential temperature (θe) is cold with respect to the inflow. Moreover, the lowest wet-bulb potential temperature (θw) values observed at the surface were within the RFD. There are, however, also observations of warm, high-θe air within RFDs.\nDifference from forward flank downdraft\nCompared to the forward flank downdraft (FFD) the rear flank downdraft (RFD) consists of warm and dry air. This is because the RFD is forced down from the mid-levels of the atmosphere, resulting in compressional heating of downward moving parcels. The FFD, in contrast, is driven by precipitation loading and evaporative cooling in the precipitation core of a supercell thunderstorm",

The FFD, in contrast, is driven by precipitation loading and evaporative cooling in the precipitation core of a supercell thunderstorm, making the FFD relatively cold and wet. Both are thought to be significant in tornado formation.\nRole in tornadogenesis\nAssociation with hook echo\nRear-flank downdrafts have a well-established association with hook echoes. Firstly, the initial rear flank downdraft is air from aloft transported down to the surface by colliding and mixing with the storm. Secondly, hook echoes form through advection of precipitation from the rear of the main echo around the region of strong updraft. Thus, precipitation loading and evaporation cooling induced by the hook echo can enhance the downdraft. Some observations showed the presence of an enhanced downdraft in the vicinity of the strongest low-level rotation, behind the main storm updraft.\nDry environmental air is also entrained into the downdraft and evaporative cooling helps create more negatively buoyant air. As precipitation falls and cool entrained air circulated downward and eventually reaching the surface. This contributes to the circulation to form a hook echo. It was concluded the presence of a hook echo can reflect downdraft intensification.\nAssociation with tornadoes\nMany researchers have realized that rear flank downdrafts, especially those associated with hook echoes, are fundamentally critical to tornado formation (torn",

In 1975, Ted Fujita originated the recycling hypothesis of tornadogenesis: First, downdraft air is recirculated into the (developing) tornado, which results in an appreciable convergence on the back side of the (still developing) tornado. Then the downward transport of the angular momentum by precipitation, and the recycling of air into the tornado, will create a tangential acceleration required for the intensification of the tornado as a positive feedback loop.\nObservations of low-level vorticity couplets within RFDs indicate that tilting of vorticity by the RFD is important in the formation of tornadoes within supercell storms. During the tornadogenesis phase in supercells, the parcels of air infiltrating the tornado or incipient tornado regularly seem to pass through the hook echo and RFD, which can serve as the basis for Fujita's recycling hypothesis. Furthermore, observations of the clear slot during and just prior to the tornadic stage, imply the air infiltrating the tornado may come from the RFD.\nRegularly, generation of large vertical vorticity close to the surface in an environment which is required for tornadogenesis, is attributed to downdraft. Tornadoes may",

    "text": " Built in the 1860s, this Second Empire house is a remnant survivor of a series of fashionable mid-19th century Victorian houses, known as  Doctor's Row . The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. It is now used for professional offices.\nDescription and history\nThe Haven House is set on the north side of Pleasant Street, just west of the Malden Center MBTA station. Its historic position was at the head of a series of similar houses along Pleasant Street, which is now lined mainly with commercial buildings. The house is a 2 1 2-story wood-frame structure, topped with a slate mansard roof and resting on a granite foundation. The roof is pierced in several places by round-arch dormers, including a doubled one above the main entrance. The walls are finished in flushboard, with quoined corners. The front facade is three bays wide, with the central bay covered by a projecting glassed-in porch two stories in height. The flanking bays each have a projecting bay window on the first floor. Roof lines of the main roof, porch, and bays are dentillated and studded with brackets. An addition to the building, made during its 1989 restoration, was done in a stylistically sensitive way.\nThe house was built for Wilbur Fiske Haven, a Boston hardware merchant, during a period of growth in Malden center occasioned by the arrival of the railroad. A later resident was William Ferguson, a railroad contractor who laid miles of track in Malden and adjacent towns. In the early 1900s a large number of doctors lived in the area, including in this house, leading the neighborhood to be dubbed  Doctor's Row . The house was repurposes as a funeral home in 1929, and has most recently housed professional offices.\nSee also\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Middlesex County, Massachusetts\n   References",

    "text": "This is a list of English words that may be of Etruscan origin, and were borrowed through Latin, often via French. The Etruscan origin of most of these words is disputed, and some may be of Indo-European or other origin. The question is made more complex by the fact that the Etruscans borrowed many Greek words in modified form. Typically if a Latin word has an unknown, uncertain or disputed origin, it is considered a possible candidate for deriving in whole or in part from an Etruscan word; however, native Etruscan must then be distinguished from Greek. If no Etruscan word is clearly identifiable sometimes an attempt is made to reconstruct one. Etruscan derivations therefore are highly variable in probability; that is, some are highly speculative and others more likely.\nList\nace\nfrom Middle English aas, from Old French as, from Latin as,  a whole, a unit, copper coin , possibly Etruscan.

    "text": "A compliments slip (or with compliments slip) is a slip of paper that contains the same name and address information that would be on a letterhead of formal letter stationery, the pre-printed salutation  with compliments  or  with our my compliments , and space afterwards for a short handwritten message to be added. It is used in correspondence, as an enclosure for other material.\nCompliments slips, which are informal, can sometimes substitute for more formal letters of reply. For example, the response to a request for a product catalogue or a price list may simply be the price list or catalogue, with a compliments slip attached, rather than with a formal letter of reply. The inclusion of compliments slips in responses to such routine requests is often seen by businesses as a necessary step in maintaining good public relations.\nThere is no fixed size for compliments slips. They may vary in size from the size of a business or visiting card, from which compliments slips originally evolved, to the size of a whole sheet of letter writing paper. Eric Bain recommends that they be of a size suitable for placing inside an envelope without more than one fold, and large enough to be noticed when included in a parcel. (Standard letter stationery outside the U.S. often requires folding twice in order to be placed inside envelopes.) To this end he recommends that compliments slips be size A6 paper. Miller recommends size A5 for stationery that doubles up as both compliments slip and headed letter paper.\nSince they are informal, compliments",

Miller recommends size A5 for stationery that doubles up as both compliments slip and headed letter paper.\nSince they are informal, compliments slips are not substitutes in those cases where a formal letter is required for legal reasons. In building contract work, for example, a drawing or a copy letter sent to a contractor with a compliments slip attached is not a formal instruction to perform the work on the drawing or letter. It is at most an invitation to perform that work, at no charge to the employer. A valid instruction would be a formal letter of instruction, or an instruction provided on a printed  Architect's Instruction  form (signed by the architect).\nFalconer states that a compliments slip should never be sent instead of a personal letter, and that it is better to send a personal letter in response to a customer enquiry, because it provides a personal touch. Hailey recommends an alternative strategy for providing a personal touch: removing the salutation from compliments slips, thus forcing the entire note to be hand-written.\nReferences\nFurther reading\nAlessandra Salvaggio; Gabriella Franchi (2006).

The group is closely affiliated with the American Association of Physicians and Surgeons, a politically conservative nonprofit association advocating numerous discredited hypotheses including AIDS denialism. It is run by Arizona physician Jane Orient.\nAccording to Bloomberg News, the group was  founded to promote civil defense during the Cold War , and has been  transformed over the years into a forum  on  fringe-science topics  such as global warming denial. DDP was described by The Guardian as a  fringe political group  and as a  truly bizarre lobby group . It promotes the denialist view that man-made global warming is not real or not an important concern.\nAffiliations\nDoctors for Disaster Preparedness share the same address with AAPS.\nDDP President Jane Orient is also the Executive Director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS).\nDDP Vice-President Arthur B.

Morano wrote of climate scientists:  I seriously believe we should kick them while they're down. They deserve to be publicly flogged. \nAnnual meetings\nIn August 2015 the group held its 33rd annual meeting. While attacks on mainstream climate science are  a staple , the meeting provides a forum to a  broad  range of material. Presentations at the 2015 meeting included a theory about links between John F. Kennedy s assassination and the deaths of his brother and son; a prediction that the aim of Obamacare was to cause the collapse the U.S. health-care system and a recommendation  that the audience start stockpiling medications and finding doctors who would work for cash ; a sympathetic discussion of the theory that low doses of radiation are ",

The meeting was covered by conservative website Breitbart, attended by George Gilder, and the conservative Heartland Institute sent its science director to present his plan to abolish the Environmental Protection Agency.\nPolitical views\nDoctors for Disaster Preparedness President Jane Orient has asserted that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports are unreliable and that relevant data was  hidden, locked in the clutches of the elite few  because the data would  decisively disproves their computer models and shows that their draconian emission controls are based on nothing except a lust for power, control and profit. \nAfter a reported increase in fallout-shelter construction since the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, she was quoted as saying,  They're treating me less like a crazy woman than they did before. \nFunding\nComputer scientist and hedge fund manager Robert Mercer has been a donor to DDP.\n   References",

While still in university, his interest in meshing fantasy sports with computer science became evident as he created a fantasy wrestling game dubbed Sgt. Slaughter's Matwars which was a basis of the formation of the Silverline Games entertainment company.\nWhile working as a programmer for an investment bank in 1994, Georgopoulos produced a simple website, with the goal of teaching himself HTML; he chose this forum to express his views on one of his favorite topics: professional football (the NFL).\nFantasy sports journalism career\nGeorgopoulos' website received enough hits to encourage Georgopoulos to regularly update his commentary, as well as recruit former owners in his college roto leagues to provide additional content. By 1996, Gridiron Grumblings was born, one of the first independent sites of sports commentary \nThe site received several awards, including Netscape's  Cool Site of the Month  and  Cool Site of the Day",

Magazine as well as a recommended site of FHM Magazine.\nIn 1998, drawing on his experience in FOREX markets and as a programmer, Georgopoulos designed the  Fantasy Forecast Rating System , a ranking system to be used across all NFL positions, enabling the absolute valuation of players.\nIts success as a tool for fantasy football owners led to the concept being applied to all the major fantasy sports: baseball, basketball and hockey. Applications of his techniques were picked up by Sports Illustrated, which ran Georgopoulos' content.\nInternet Audio Broadcasts as early as 1996, Georgopoulos was producing one-hour audio broadcasts, which were made available to his readers. Dubbed  WGRD Radio , there were 117 episodes recorded through September 11, 2001. His first-person account of the 9 11 attacks on the World Trade Center marked the final broadcast of WGRD Radio.\nIn 2004, WGRD Radio was reincarnated as Gridiron Grumblings Live!, a two-hour live broadcast covering fantasy football, the NFL and other topical events.\nIndividual Defensive Players (IDPs) in standard fantasy football leagues.

While a staple of fantasy football drafts today, the inclusion of IDPs in 1996-97 was considered FFL heresy. Consistency Rankings was a metric designed to describe the degree to which a set of player performances varied either over the course of a season or a career which was in essence, the application of a Coefficient of Variance to fantasy play. Age Variance was a metric to define the statistical effect of player age on performance, by position. \nOn Sept. 4, 2010, Georgopoulos premiered a new weekly show, Sports Grumblings Live!, on SiriusXM Satellite radio. The show was a three-hour broadcast focusing on all the major fantasy sports, concurrently entertaining and informing the listeners. The show had a time slot of 8-11 PM ET on Saturday nights, on Sirius 210  XM 87. Sirius XM decided not to renew the show for a second season.\nIn 2013, Georgopoulos accepted an offer to be a featured fantasy football writer at Fantasy Sharks.com.\nIn 2020, Georgopoulos left Fantasy Sharks to form a new fantasy sports site, Nerd Fantasy Sports, which leveraged the talents of data scientists and veteran fantasy sports journalists.\nIn 2022, Georgopoulos partnered with fellow fantasy sports pioneer William",

    "text": "Broadway's Fair Julie is the third solo studio album by English actress and singer Julie Andrews, released in 1961 by Columbia Records. The album features Andrews performing a curated selection of Broadway show tunes, accompanied by Henri René   His Orchestra. Recorded during a transitional phase in her career, it followed her acclaimed stage successes in My Fair Lady and Camelot and coincided with her pregnancy with her daughter, Emma. The record comprises twelve tracks drawn from various musicals such as West Side Story, Kismet and Finian's Rainbow.\nThe album includes both celebrated and lesser-known songs from the Broadway repertoire, among them  Looking for a Boy  from Tip-Toes,  I Feel Pretty  from West Side Story and  Baubles, Bangles,   Beads  from Kismet. According to some reviews, Andrews s rendition of  A Sleepin' Bee  from House of Flowers displays her ability to adapt material originally written in dialect, while the closing number,  If Love Were All  from Noël Coward's Bitter Sweet, adds a distinctly British flavor. \nUpon release, Broadway's Fair Julie received favorable notices from critics, who praised Andrews s vocal precision and the lush orchestral production. Publications such as Billboard and Cash Box highlighted her expressive interpretations and the album s sophisticated presentation, though some critics noted unevenness across certain selections. Commercially, it failed to chart.\nBackground and recording\nBroadway's Fair Julie features Andrews performing a selection of Broadway show tunes",

Recorded during a transitional period in her career, the project followed her success in the Broadway musicals My Fair Lady and Camelot and coincided with her pregnancy, as she gave birth to her daughter, Emma Kate Walton, later that year.\nThe album was produced during a time when Andrews was exploring opportunities beyond the stage, as she transitioned toward film roles. It allowed her to record songs she had not performed in her stage career, offering a broader representation of her vocal interpretations of Broadway material. The orchestral arrangements by Henri René provide a lush backdrop to the selections, which range from upbeat show tunes to more introspective ballads.\nAlbum details\nThe album reflects the diversity of mid-20th century Broadway, showcasing songs by composers such as Leonard Bernstein, Richard Rodgers, and Kurt Weill, among others. It consists of 12 tracks, drawing from a variety of musicals, including West Side Story, Kismet, and Finian's Rainbow, among others.\nThe tracklist includes both well-known and lesser-known songs from the Broadway repertoire.

Also featuring is  How Are Things in Glocca Morra  from Finian's Rainbow and  A Sleepin  Bee  from House of Flowers, the latter of which was originally performed in a West Indian dialect that Andrews adapted to her own vocal style. The closing track,  If Love Were All,  is from Noël Coward's Bitter Sweet, adding a British touch to the collection. A previously unreleased track,  I'll Follow My Secret Heart , can be found in a CD called A Little Bit of Broadway (1988).\nReleases\nIn Japan, where Broadway's Fair Julie was not released, CBS issued a compilation album in 1965 titled Broadway's Hits ( YS-495-C), featuring twelve tracks. This collection included ten of the twelve songs from the original album, replacing  Looking for a Boy  and  If Love Were All  with  Wouldn't It Be Loverly  and  I Could Have Danced All Night , taken from the original cast recording of My Fair Lady.

In 1972, Harmony Records re-released the album, now titled T.V.'s Fair Julie, with two fewer songs:  This Is New  and  If Love Were All  ( KH 31958).\nThe album was re-released on CD three times. The first reissue (released only in Spain) came in 1995 under the Sony Music Special Marketing label, part of CBS Sony. This edition was a 2-in-1 compilation, featuring Julie Andrews' later album, Don't Go in the Lion's Cage Tonight and Other Heartrending Ballads and Raucous Ditties, on the same CD. William Ruhlmann from AllMusic rated the album four out five stars and wrote a favorable review. In 2015, Él Records, a subsidiary of Cherry Red Records, reissued the compilation once again, adding four bonus tracks from the 1954 cast recording The Boy Friend, starring Andrews. In total, this version contains 28 tracks. In 2012, Hallmark Records released the album in its entirety and individually, with the original cover art.\nCritical reception\nBillboard praised Julie Andrews's performance for  excellent results  and highlighted Henri René's  neatly  filled orchestration, also noting that the album cover was  a solid asset .

Similarly, Cash Box commends Andrews' refined vocal delivery, particularly in  Looking for a Boy  and  I Feel Pretty , while also recognizing René's instrumental support as a key strength. In contrast, Star-News shifts the focus to the  warmth and tenderness  Andrews brings to her performances, especially in  Looking for a Boy  and  I Didn't Know What Time It Was , celebrating her emotional depth rather than technical precision.\nWhile some reviews emphasize the album's strengths, others offer a more critical perspective. William Ruhlmann from AllMusic website acknowledges Andrews' ability to infuse lesser-known theater songs with warmth and charm but argues that her style falters in pieces like  A Sleepin' Bee . This contrasts with The Second Disc, which takes a more nuanced stance, praising Andrews' ability to breathe new life into Broadway standards. The latter review highlights her expressive performance in  I Feel Pretty  and her graceful handling of torch songs, also appreciating the diversity of the tracklist and her adaptability across styles.\nIn his Playbill article titled  From 'Mary Poppins' to 'Victor Victoria': The Julie Andrews Albums Every Fan Should Own , Ben Rimalower highlights the album, as a defining moment in her burgeoning recording career.

According to him, the album showcases her impeccable talent through sumptuous arrangements of Broadway standards. Rimalower particularly commends her renditions of  I Feel Pretty  and  If Love Were All , noting how she brings fresh, nuanced qualities to these familiar songs, further cementing her status as a vocal powerhouse.\nCommercial performance\nAccording to Robert Windeler, writer of Julie Andrews   A Biography, Andrews's solo albums released between the late 1950s and early 1960s, like Broadway's Fair Julie, did not do well in sales. The singer said in a Music-Business magazine's interview:  I love recording and I want to do a lot more of it. But the problem is to find a happy medium between what you as an artist want to do and what your public wants you to do. It seems I'm lucky with the show albums but I'll have to keep looking for an answer on the kind where I'm alone . According to Windeler, the limited sales prevented the singer from making more albums later on.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of Broadway's Fair Julie.\nFeaturing  With    Henri René And His Orchestra\nPhotography By  Photo    Richard Aved sales prevented the singer from making more albums later on.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of Broadway's Fair Julie.\nFeaturing  With    Henri René And His Orchestra\nPhotography By  Photo    Richard Avedon\nProducer   James Foglesong \nReferences\n    Bibliography",

The company was founded in 1884 in Liestal, Switzerland, by Albert Handschin. The Huber Group acquired the company in 1991.\nHistory\n1884 to 1945\nIn 1884, Albert Handschin founded a hand-knitting company in Liestal. Carl Ronus joined the company in 1895. The two entrepreneurs established a general partnership under the legal name Handschin   Ronus. The company had 60 employees at that time. In 1898, the company acquired the Benzbur property in Liestal. The production buildings there were ready for use a year later. In 1911, growing demand allowed the opening of a second production facility in Büren, Solothurn. The brand Hanro, a portmanteau of the surnames of the founders, was registered as a trademark in 1913. Before World War I, the company produced and exported lingerie for women. The most important sales markets in the prewar years were in France, the British Empire, and the United States.\nDuring World War I, the company adjusted its product assortment and began to produce military underwear.

The most important sales markets in the prewar years were in France, the British Empire, and the United States.\nDuring World War I, the company adjusted its product assortment and began to produce military underwear. At the end of 1919, the owners converted the general partnership into a family-owned public limited company: Hanro AG. A subsidiary was established in Australia in 1926. As a result, 17 employees settled in Bendigo and began production with the machines that they had brought with them from Switzerland. From the mid-1930s, the company expanded into beach and swimwear. Technological innovations (circular knitting machines) also allowed the company to move into outerwear.\nDuring World War II production and sales were difficult because materials were scarce, textiles were rationed, and fabrics were substituted.\n1945 to 1991\nOnce the war was over, production was picked up again. This resulted in the recruitment of young women from Italy in 1947. In the years that followed, the employment of these Italian women was considered a positive example in the history of Swiss labor migration. From 1946 to 1958 production volume grew and the number of employees doubled to a total of 689. In the 1950s, Hanro sold its products in 45 countries.\nHanro took over the textile company HIS   Co.

    "text": "Stix is a public art installation or sculpture at Korean Veterans Boulevard and 8th Avenue in Nashville, Tennessee. It was designed by Christian Moeller, and erroneously reported to be an homage to the Native Americans who owned the land prior to European settlers.  Actually, that was not my original intent. The only reference to Native American art I made was showing an image of a beautiful totem pole at an early stage of the project development. I did this in order to give an example of how the colors I proposed to use would contrast with the grayish, silver patina that the wooden poles would develop over time,  said Moeller. Its construction cost  750,000, making it the  most expensive  public art installation in Nashville. According to Nashville Public Radio, its cost and name turned it into  a magnet for skepticism  prior to its dedication in 2015. In March 2018, a car crashed into the installation.\nThe original design called for 35 poles standing 85 feet high and each pole tip was to be covered with a custom-made  LED lightcap  to emit a light glow at nighttime. The design was later revised to reduce the number to 27 poles at a height of 70 feet tall and to eliminate the lightcaps.\nCreated to resemble that of a gladiator arena to go along with the ancient theme as that of the Parthenon in Nashville. Situated on a round about, this is to give drivers the illusion they are in a chariot arena. The colored poles represent spears which used by gladiators in an attempt to skewer riders off their mounts. Drivers going through here make it a game by driving faster in order dodge the poles as if they are being used to attack the vehicles.\n   References",

Together, the collection, transport, treatment and end use of fecal sludge constitute the  value chain  or  service chain  of fecal sludge management. Fecal sludge is defined very broadly as what accumulates in onsite sanitation systems (e.g. pit latrines, septic tanks and container-based solutions) and specifically is not transported through a sewer. It is composed of human excreta, but also anything else that may go into an onsite containment technology, such as flushwater, cleansing materials (e.g. toilet paper and anal cleansing materials), menstrual hygiene products, grey water (i.e. bathing or kitchen water, including fats, oils and grease), and solid waste. Fecal sludge that is removed from septic tanks is called septage.\nIt is estimated that one-third of the world's population is served by onsite sanitation, and that in low-income countries less than 10  of urban areas are served by sewers. In low-income countries, the majority of fecal sludge is discharged untreated into the urban environment, placing a huge burden on public and environmental health.

FSM services are provided by a range of formal and informal private sector services providers, local governments, water authorities, and public utilities. This can also result in unreliable services with relatively high costs at the household level.\nAlthough new technology now allows for fecal sludge to be treated onsite (see Mobile Treatment Units below) the majority of fecal sludge is collected and either disposed of into the environment or treated offsite. Fecal sludge collection can be arranged on a scheduled basis or on a call-for-service basis (also known as on-demand, on-request, or non-scheduled services). The collected fecal sludge may be manually or mechanically emptied, and then transported to treatment plants with a vacuum truck, a tank and pump mounted on a flatbed truck, a small tank pulled by a motorcycle, or in containers on a handcart. The wider use of multiple decentralized sludge treatment facilities within cities (to avoid long haulage distances) is currently being researched and piloted.\nFecal sludge is different to wastewater and cannot simply be co-treated at sewage treatment plants. Small additions of fecal sludge are possible if plants are underutilized and able to take the additional load, and facilities to separate liquids and solids are available.

The incorporation of the entire sanitation management service chain in the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6, as opposed to just providing access to toilets, has further established acknowledge of the importance of FSM. The SDGs were launched in 2015, and SDG 6 is for  clean water and sanitation for all by 2030 ), launched in 2015, has further established acknowledgement of its importance. There has also been an increase in the incorporation of fecal sludge management in national regulations and development agency agendas, increased funding from foundations and governments, and implementation of infrastructure and service provision.\nThere has been a rapid increase in evidence-based research and journal publications on the topic (e.g. for Africa and Asia). There are rapidly evolving technology developments along the entire service chain. Some have the potential to alter the existing service chain, such as container-based sanitation, decentralized options, and innovations developed through the Bill   Melinda Gates Foundation 'Reinvent the Toilet Challenge' since at least 2012. \nCurriculums have been, and are continuing to be, developed and implemented.

This may be due to a lack of mandated institutions and low awareness of the impact of poor sanitation; a lack of technical expertise and experience; an inability to source funds for to purchase of vacuum trucks and treatment, as well as a lack of knowledge necessary to initiate and implement successful FSM programs. Another factor is that the transporting fecal sludge has a real cost to vacuum truck operators and there is thus an incentive to dispose of the untreated waste into the environment (primarily into waterways, but also directly onto the land.) Failure to properly manage fecal sludge can result in the poor performance of onsite sanitation facilities (OSSFs), fecal sludge overflowing from containments, and the unsafe emptying and dumping of untreated fecal sludge into the environment.\nFecal sludge contains pathogens, can generate odors and cause surface water pollution, as well as groundwater pollution.\nComponents\nFecal sludge management (FSM) requires safe and hygienic septic tank and pit latrine emptying services, along with the effective treatment of solids and liquids",

It may include a range of options including on-site and offsite treatment, and the dispersal or capture and further processing of the products of the treatment process into such as biogas, compost and energy.\nBy type of dwellings\nCities\nFSM is a critical sanitation service in cities and towns in all countries where households use onsite sanitation systems. Citywide FSM programs may utilize multiple or one treatment facility, use stationary and mobile transfer stations, and engage with micro, small and medium-sized enterprises that may conduct some or all of the services. Programs may be phased in over time to accommodate growing demand.\nPeri urban areas\nPeri urban areas are often less densely populated than urban centers. Therefore, they have more space and on-site sanitation systems can be effective for solid and liquid treatment. In most such peri-urban areas, it is less likely that they will be connected to a conventional centralized sewerage system in the short or medium term. Therefore, these areas will rely on a mix of onsite-sanitation systems and services, decentralized wastewater management systems, or by condominial or simplified sewerage connected to decentralized or centralized treatment.

In all of these situations, FSM is a necessary service to keep the sanitation systems functioning properly.\nRural areas\nRural areas with low population density may not need formal FSM services if the local practice is to cover and rebuild latrines when they fill up. However, if this is not possible, rural areas often lack treatment facilities within a reasonable (say 30 minutes drive) distance; are difficult for tankers to access and often have limited demand for emptying making transport and treatment uneconomic, and unaffordable for most people. Therefore, options such as relocating latrines on-site, double (alternating) pit or Arborloo toilets could be considered. Also sharing decentralized FSM services and sludge treatment between nearby villages, or direct safe removal burial of waste could be considered and organized.\nAlternatives to fecal sludge producing systems\nMost types of dry toilets (except for pit latrines) do not generate fecal sludge but generate instead dried feces (in the case of urine-diverting dry toilets) or compost (in the case of composting toilets).

Water utilities with a high percentage of water connectivity (homes with piped water connections) are logical operators of FSM programs. If water is sold to customers through a tariff, an additional tariff to cover FSM services may be added. For larger cities, it is usually the water and sewerage service provider that will be the most appropriate operator.\nLocal governments may choose to provide services by using their own staff and resources for collection, transportation and treatment. This is often the case in smaller cities or municipalities where the water utility may not have a broad reach. In many cases, cooperation between the city government and the water utility may be strategically advantageous. Dumaguete City, Philippines, is one example where the Water District (utility) and Local Government have joint ownership and responsibilities for the FSM program. Organized larger scale FSM programs may be able to provide the service more cheaply and more hygienically than the independent private operators working on an ad hoc basis.

Ensuring services are affordable is an important selling point when promoting the program to citizens and encouraging them to participate.\nThe local private sector is an important player in providing FSM services. In such cases, private sector contractors may work directly for households (under regulation) or bid on desludging contracts let by the city. The private sector can also provide services in operating and maintaining the treatment works, and in processing and selling the commodities resulting from the treatment process. San Fernando City, La Union, Philippines is an example of a local government that has contracted out the treatment facility construction and collection program to the private sector.\nScheduled desludging programs\nScheduled desludging is a planned effort by the local government or utility to ensure regular desludging of septic tanks. In this process, every property is covered along a defined route and the property occupiers are informed in advance about desludging that will take place. The actual desludging (or emptying of septic tanks) can be done through a public private partnership (PPP) arrangement.\nIn Southeast Asia, there is (in 2016) increasing interest in scheduled desludging programs as a means of providing services.

Analysis of pit and tank desludging records for Palu in Indonesia revealed that existing demand for desludging services varied between sub-districts, with demand being greatest in well-established areas and least in urban fringe areas.\nThere are multiple benefits of scheduled desludging services in the Indian context: Achieves the norms through regular desludging, reduces high prices of desludging, removes the need for manual labor, improves environmental and public health impacts, links with local taxes rather than with user charges. Scheduled desludging has been initiated in several Asian countries including the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, and India.

These workers contribute to safe fecal sludge management.\nTransport options\nCollection vehicles and equipment\nIf the fecal sludge is liquid enough, it is usually collected by using vacuum pumps or centrifugal style booster pumps. A variety of manual and motorized devices designed to excavate thick and viscous sludge and accumulated trash are also available in the market.\nAfter sitting for years in septic tanks and pit latrines, the accumulated sludge becomes hardened and is very difficult to remove. It is still common that workers enter pits in order to desludge them, even though this practice is generally unsafe and undesirable (in India, this practice is called  manual scavenging ). A number of low-cost pumping systems exist to remove this hardened sludge hygienically from the ground surface, although many of them are still in the experimental stage (e.g. Excravator, Gulper, e-Vac).\nFecal sludge can also be treated inside the tank or pit as well, by use of the  in",

Once removed, it is transported to onsite or off site treatment and processing facilities.\nSome advanced transfer stations and vacuum trucks can dewater fecal sludge to some extent, and this water may be placed in sewer lines to be treated in wastewater treatment plants. This allows more sludge to be dealt with more efficiently and may constitute one of the best cases of co-treatment of fecal sludge in wastewater treatment plants.\nTransfer stations\nTransfer stations are intermediary drop off locations often used where treatment facilities are located too far away from population centers to make direct disposal feasible. In other locations, traffic concerns or local truck bans during daylight hours may make transfer stations feasible. In addition, municipalities where a significant percentage of homes cannot be accessed by tanker truck should utilize transfer stations. Transfer stations are used if:\nMore than 5  of the homes are inaccessible by a vacuum truck;\nThe treatment plant is too far away from the homes for transport in one haul to be practical;\nTrucks are not permitted on the streets during the day; or\nHeavy traffic during daylight hours impedes the movement of vacuum trucks.\nMobile transfer stations\nMobile transfer stations are nothing more",

The smaller vehicles discharge to the larger tanker, which then carries the collected sludge to the treatment plant. These work well in scheduled desludging business models.\nFixed transfer stations\nFixed transfer stations are dedicated facilities installed strategically throughout the municipality that serve as drop off locations for collected fecal sludge. They may include a receiving station with screens, a tank for holding the collected waste, trash storage containers, and wash down facilities. These may be more appropriate for FSM programs using the  call-for-service  business model.\nWhile static transfer stations are fixed tanks, mobile transfer stations are simply tanker trucks or trailers that work alongside the SVVs and actually do the longer haul transferring of the waste from the community to the treatment plant.

This option is preferable as it does not require transport of the septage and avoids the common practice of illegal disposal of untreated septage into the environment. Six mobile septage treatment units have been built to date using readily available filters and membranes (mesh fabric, sand, granular activated carbon (GAC), microfilter, ultrafilter) and installed on the bed of a small truck. The target application is emptying of septic or sewage holding tanks and concentration of suspended solids while generating a liquid that could be safely discharged.

However, the high strength of septage and fecal sludge means that relatively small volumes of both can have a large impact on the organic, suspended solids, and nitrogen loads on a wastewater treatment plant. Possible consequences include an increase in the volume of screenings and grit requiring removal; increased odour emission at headworks; increased scum and sludge accumulation rates; and increased organic loading, leading to overloading and process failure, and the potential for increased odour and foaming in aeration tanks. Because of their partly digested nature, septage and fecal sludge will usually degrade at a slower rate than municipal wastewater. Therefore, their presence is likely to have an adverse impact on the efficacy of treatment processes. The intermittent nature of fecal sludge and septage loading can also amplify the problems identified above.\nDespite these possible drawbacks, wastewater treatment facilities with spare capacity are a potential resource to be investigated. Even where co-treatment is not an option, existing wastewater treatment plants may provide land in strategic locations, close to areas of demand for septage management services. Separate preliminary treatment and solids-liquid separation facilities should always be provided for septage fecal sludge. Solids-liquid separation will reduce both the overall load and the",

Separate preliminary treatment and solids-liquid separation facilities should always be provided for septage fecal sludge. Solids-liquid separation will reduce both the overall load and the proportion of digested material in the liquid fraction and will thus lessen the possibility that it will disrupt wastewater treatment processes. Separated solids can be treated along with the sludge produced in sedimentation tanks during the wastewater treatment process.\nTechnology selection\nA formal process should be used for making an informed technology selection for the treatment of the fecal sludge. It is usually a collaborative process conducted by stakeholders, consultants, the operator and the future owner of the facility. The process is based on a long term vision planning with stakeholders as part of citywide sanitation planning. The expected waste flows (volume), their strength, characteristics, and variability in each area need to be known. A formal and transparent process for developing appropriate plans and designs for wastewater and fecal sludge treatment plants will achieve local buy-in and ownership of technology decisions, which is critical for the long term success and sustainability of the program.\nReuse options\nResource recovery from fecal sludge can take many forms, including as a fuel, soil amendment, building material, protein, animal fodder, and water for irrigation. Some of the by-products from fecal sludge treatment processes have the potential to offset some of the costs of collection and treatment, thereby reducing tariffs for the households. However,",

Some of the by-products from fecal sludge treatment processes have the potential to offset some of the costs of collection and treatment, thereby reducing tariffs for the households. However, value addition all the way to biogas, biodiesel and electricity is difficult to achieve in practice due to technological and operational challenges.\nComposting\nComposting is a process whereby organic matter is digested in the presence of oxygen with the byproduct of heat. For fecal sludge, the heat deactivates the pathogens while the digestion process breaks down the organic matter into a humus-like material that acts as a soils amendment, and nutrients that are broken down into a form that is more easily taken up by plants. Properly treated fecal sludge can be reused in agriculture.\nFecal sludge is rich in nitrogen. When fecal sludge is mixed with materials that are rich in carbon, such as shredded crop wastes, the composting process can be maximized. Proper mixture to achieve a ratio of 20 to 1 to 30 to 1 of carbon to nitrogen is best.\nSolid fuel\nResource recovery as a solid fuel has been found to have high market potential in Sub-Saharan Africa. The selection of the fuel type will depend on: (1) the intended use of the fuel (e.g. combustion technology, user handling requirements, and amount required); and (2) the properties of the input fecal",

Once suitable technology options are identified, they must subsequently be evaluated for best fit in the local context (e.g. local capacity for electricity, land, and technical (operation and maintenance) requirements).\nOthers\nBiogas is a renewable energy that is a byproduct of the anaerobic digestion process.\nTreated effluent can be used for agricultural or landscape irrigation.\nCosts and fees\nFSM is considered an entry point for sanitation improvement programs that are led by local governments. Such programs may include tariffs or user fees, promotions campaigns to raise the willingness to pay for the service, and local ordinances that define the rules and regulations governing FSM. In the Philippines, tariffs around US 1 per family per month are generally enough to achieve full cost recovery within a period of 3 to 7 years. Promotional campaigns are used to raise the willingness to pay for services, and local procedures and ordinances provide additional incentives for compliance.\nSynergies with other sectors\nFSM is but one aspect of citywide sanitation that also includes: \nMunicipal solid waste management;\nDrainage and greywater management;\nWastewater collection and treatment including effluent",

MSW can often be co-managed with fecal waste, especially when thermal treatment technologies are used. Food waste from restaurants and markets can be co-composted with fecal waste to produce a high value soils amendment. Fats, Oil and Grease (FOG) from commercial grease traps can be added to biodigesters to increase methane production, or used in conjunction with fecal sludge as a feedstock for biodiesel production. Water supply is also closely linked with FSM as it is often the water utility that will manage programs and their customers that will pay for services through tariffs.\nExamples\nDumaguete, the Philippines\nUSAID has supported efforts to introduce scheduled desludging services in some countries in Southeast Asia.

The program was run jointly by the city government and the Dumaguete City Water District, with the former operating the treatment plant and the Water District conducting the desludging. The cost of the scheme was covered by adding a tariff of 2 pesos (about 5 US cents) to the water bill for each cubic meter of water consumed (about one US dollar per family per month). This approach was possible because around 95  of residents had a connection to the Water District reticulation system. Trucks were to move from neighborhood to neighborhood on a scheduled cycle, emptying pits on a regular 3 4 year cycle. This approach requires a database of all pits and septic tanks requiring desludging. However, Dumaguete has by 2018 reverted to an 'on-call' system, the cost of which is still covered by the surcharge on the water tariff. It seems that users prefer this small regular payment to having to make large payments when tanks require desludging.\nSee also\nSewage Sludge\nBiosolids - treated sewage sludge\nEcological Sanitation\nNightsoil - a historical term for a material similar to fecal sludge\nSewage sludge treatment\nWASH - water supply, sanitation, hygiene\nReferences\nExternal links\nSustainable Sanitation Alliance library (documents on FSM)\nDocuments about fecal sludge management in the library of the Sustainable San sludge\nSewage sludge treatment\nWASH - water supply, sanitation, hygiene\nReferences\nExternal links\nSustainable Sanitation Alliance library (documents on FSM)\nDocuments about fecal sludge management in the library of the Sustainable Sanitation Alliance (SuSanA)\nFaecal Sludge Management (FSM) book   Systems Approach for Implementation and Operation by EAWAG (2014), in English and several other languages",

The Pramāṇavārttika is the magnum opus of the Indian Buddhist Dharmakirti (floruit 6-7th centuries).\nOutline\nThe Pramanavarttika is written in about 2,000 verse stanzas. The four chapters deal, respectively, with inference for oneself (svarthanumana), valid knowledge (pramanasiddhi), sense perception (pratyaksa), and inference for others (pararthanumana). The work is a commentary on an earlier work by the Buddhist logician Dignaga, the Pramanasamuccaya.\nChapter 1\nThe first chapter (the svarthanumana chapter) discusses the structure and types of formal inference and the apoha (exclusion) theory of meaning.

Dharmakirti critiques the Vedic brahmins thus:\nThe unquestioned authority of the Vedas;\nthe belief in a world-creator;\nthe quest for purification through ritual bathing;\nthe arrogant division into castes;\nthe practice of mortification to atone for sin \nthese five are the marks of the crass stupidity of witless men.\nDharmakīrti also discusses the role of scripture, which he sees as fallible and yet important for their discussion of  radically inaccessible things  (atyantaparokṣa) such as karma.\nChapter 2\nThe second, pramanasiddhi chapter first seeks to defend the authority of the Buddha as a valid source of knowledge for those seeking spiritual",

His defense focuses on the five epithets of the Buddha attributed to him by Dignaga: being a means of knowledge (pramanabhutatva), seeking the benefit of all living creatures, being a teacher, being 'well gone', and being a protector.\nDharmakirti uses the Buddha's infinite compassion (karuṇā) as a basis for the proof that he is a reliable source of knowledge, as he writes  compassion is the proof  of the Buddha being a means of knowledge . \nFrom the discussion on the Buddha's infinite compassion, Dharmakirti then goes on to attack the materialist theories of the Carvaka school and the soul theories of the Hindu Brahminical schools and provides a defense of the Buddhist concept of rebirth. According to Dan Arnold, Dharmakirti's argument here is that:  sentient phenomena must have among their causes events that are themselves sentient; events, more generally, must have ontologically homogeneous causes. The straightforward claim is thus that the events constituting the physical body are ontologically distinct from those that cause mental events.  For Dharmakirti then, cognition is dependent not",

The straightforward claim is thus that the events constituting the physical body are ontologically distinct from those that cause mental events.  For Dharmakirti then, cognition is dependent not just on sense objects and physical sense organs, but on a previous event of awareness (manovijnana). This argument has been described by Dan Arnold as dualistic, a denial of the irreducibility of mental events to physical events and to be an appeal to qualia even though Dharmakirti eventually goes on to defend a form of epistemic idealism (Yogacara).\nChapter 3\nIn the third chapter, Dharmakirti argues that there are only two valid pramanas, perception (pratyaksa), which is the foundation, and inference (anumana), which is based on but not reducible to perception. These two pramanas have as their objects the only two kinds of things that exist, unique particulars (svalaksanas) and the abstract universals (samanyalaksana). Svalaksana are the ultimately existing things, the only kind of thing that really exists. Since perception is seen as apprehending the real unique particulars, it is for Dharmakirti,  devoid of conception.

This force functioned exclusively in the state of Arkansas.\nHistory\nThe Army of Arkansas was created on July 27, 1863, with Major General Frederick Steele in command. The army was created in the wake of the Union victories at Vicksburg and Helena, both of which occurred on July 4, 1863, resulting in the complete consolidation of federal control of the Mississippi River and the opportunity to seize Little Rock and begin pacification efforts to return Arkansas to the Union. It was composed of troops in Union-occupied areas of the state of Arkansas. General Steele led the army in its two most significant campaigns: The Little Rock Expedition and Camden Expedition. At Little Rock the army consisted of three divisions under John W. Davidson, Adolph Englemann and Samuel A. Rice.\nDuring the Camden Expedition the army consisted of one corps   the VII Corps   and the two were virtually synonymous. It was composed of the divisions of Frederick Salomon, John M. Thayer and Eugene A. Carr.\nSteele was replaced as commander of the army on December 22, 1864, by Major General Joseph J. Reynolds. Reynolds commanded the army during Price's Missouri Raid but his troops actively involved in the Union pursuit. Reynolds remained in command until the war's end.\nCommanders\nMajor General Frederick Steele (July 27, 1863   December 22, 1864)\nMajor General Joseph J.

Nicholas Barham was called to the bar at Gray's Inn in 1542, became an 'ancient' of that society 24 May 1552, Lent reader in 1558, and was made serjeant-at-law in 1567, having previously (1562 3) been returned to parliament as member for Maidstone, of which town he also appears to have been recorder.\nTreason trials\nWilliam Dugdale does not place Barham in the list of queen's serjeants until 1573. He is, however, so designated in papers relating to the trial of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, for high treason in conspiring with Mary, Queen of Scots to depose Elizabeth, in 1571 2. He was given the conduct of the prosecution. From a letter from Sir Thomas Smith to Lord Burghley it appears that the rack was employed on a witness Banister, one of the duke's agents.

The trial of the duke took place in Westminster Hall 16 January 1572.\nIn the following February Barham was engaged in prosecuting the duke's secretary, Robert Higford, at the Court of Queen's Bench, on the charge of adhering to and comforting the queen's enemies. Higford was found guilty and, like his master, condemned to death.\nDeath\nIn 1577 Barham was present at the Oxford assizes during the prosecution of a malcontent bookbinder, Rowland Jencks, a Roman Catholic. Jencks had spoken badly of dignities and kept away from church; the university authorities had him arrested and sent to London to undergo examination, and he was returned to Oxford to stand trial. This took place on 4 July, when he was sentenced to lose his ears. There was a sudden outbreak of gaol fever; if the account of Anthony Wood is to be credited, besides Barham and Sir Robert Bell, baron of the exchequer, the high sheriff and his deputy, Sir William Babington, four justices of the peace, three gentlemen, and most of the jury died; and in the course of the next five weeks more than five hundred others.\nFamily\nBar",

His pitching was inconsistent in the first two months of the season, with pitch command problems leading to a large number of walks, and with a poor record against left-handed batters. On June 19, 2014, Wheeler pitched a complete-game shutout against the Miami Marlins, facing only 28 batters and allowing just three hits. Although the Mets' 2014 season was considered largely disappointing, being mathematically eliminated from postseason contention by September 20, Wheeler's performance was considered to be a bright spot.

Shortly after the announcement, sources reported that Wheeler had torn a tendon in the same elbow during the previous season, and that he had undergone platelet-rich plasma therapy to hasten the healing process. Wheeler underwent Tommy John surgery for the torn ligament on March 25. After seeing Matt Harvey's successful return to the mound following an 18-month rehabilitation process from the same surgery, the Mets expressed a desire to stretch out Wheeler's rehabilitation process, with a targeted return to the rotation in July 2016.\nWheeler suffered a series of setbacks in his return from Tommy John surgery. In early April 2016, he underwent a second surgery to remove an undissolved stitch in his elbow, and the Mets pushed his expected return to after the MLB All-Star break.

On September 3, Mets manager Terry Collins told reporters that Wheeler was shut down for the remainder of the season.\n2017 19\nWheeler signed a one-year,  800,000 contract with the Mets on January 11, 2017, avoiding arbitration. He made his first major league start in over two years on April 8, allowing five runs and six hits in only four innings against the Miami Marlins. He pitched a perfect first inning, with his fastball speeds up to 97 mph (156 km h), but as the game continued, his velocity dropped to 93 mph (150 km h). The worst two starts of his career both occurred in June, first when he gave up eight runs in 1 2 3 innings against the Chicago Cubs and then when he gave up two home runs to Los Angeles Dodgers rookie Cody Bellinger, helping Bellinger set a record for most home runs in a player's first 51 major league games.\nWhen Wheeler was put on the 10-day disabled list on June 22 with biceps",

Injuries continued to follow Wheeler through the second part of the season. He returned to the disabled list on July 24 after suffering a stress injury to the humerus. He was shut down for the season on August 24. In 17 starts, Wheeler posted a 3 7 record with a 5.21 ERA for the 2017 season.\nAlthough Wheeler entered the 2018 season healthy, the Mets' offseason signing of All-Star Jason Vargas led to speculation that Wheeler would be moved out of the starting rotation and into the bullpen. After a disappointing spring training performance, Wheeler began the season with Las Vegas. He was called to fill Vargas' spot in the rotation after the latter pitcher was placed on the disabled list, and a strong performance against the Washington Nationals on April 18 demonstrated Wheeler's ability to remain in the major league rotation.

Mets manager Mickey Callaway confirmed on September 19, 2018, that Wheeler was finished pitching for the season. He went 12 7 for the year, with a 3.31 ERA and a 1.12 WHIP in 29 starts.\nAs he was set to become a free agent at the end of the 2019 season, there were rumors that the Mets would attempt to trade Wheeler before the July 31 deadline, but they instead elected to retain him, with then-general manager Brodie Van Wagenen telling reporters,  We think he's a good pitcher. We have interest in him being a Met for the long term.  As with the previous season, Wheeler improved in the second half of 2019.

In his season debut on April 3, Wheeler struck out 10 batters in 7 innings, the first time he recorded a double-digit number of strikeouts with the Phillies. Additionally, he became the first Phillies' pitcher to have two or more hits and RBIs in a single game since Ben Lively in 2017. On May 29, Wheeler struck out a career-high 14 batters, becoming the third pitcher in Phillies history, following Steve Carlton and Curt Schilling, to strike out 10 or more batters in three consecutive starts. A wild pitch from Sam Coonrod in the eighth inning, however, caused the Tampa Bay Rays to win the game 5 3. After posting a 2.05 ERA in his first 17 starts and leading the league with 139 strikeouts in 114 innings pitched, Wheeler received his first MLB All-Star Game selection in 2021.

His sinker is also known for its velocity: in the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, Wheeler's sinker velocity of 97.1 mph (156.3 km h) was the second-highest among pitchers who threw the pitch at least 100 times. As his career progressed, however, Wheeler began to show a preference for pitching the fastball, as batters made contact more often against the sinker. The change was similar to that of New York Yankees pitcher Gerrit Cole, whose pitching performance improved after abandoning his sinker.\nAmong his other pitches, Wheeler uses his curveball and changeup to supplement the fastball and slider. He considers the curveball to be  decent , and believes that his control of the pitch, which he has been throwing since high school, has decreased with the continued improvement of his slider. His changeup, by contrast, is a more recent pitch, one that Wheeler began throwing in the 2014 season to confuse batters expecting a hard fastball. His slider is his least developed pitch, and Wheeler expressed a desire prior to the 2021 season to improve the pitch's consistency and  make it look like a strike instead of it ... being like a waste pitch .\nPersonal life\nWheeler and his wife Dominique have four children, a son born July 20, 2020, shortly before the start of the pandemic-shortened 2020 MLB season, and three daughters.

He was recruited in 1850 as an interpreter by the crew of the British survey barque HMS Assistance during the search for John Franklin's lost Arctic expedition. He guided the ship to Wolstenholme Fjord to investigate rumors of a massacre of Franklin's crew, but only found the corpses of local Inughuit and crew from an unrelated British vessel. With the help of the crew of the vessel, he produced accurate maps of his homeland. Although Assistance initially planned to return him to his family after the expedition, poor sea conditions made landing at Cape York impossible, and he was taken to England and placed under the care of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK).\nEnrolled at St Augustine's College in Canterbury, England, Qalaherriaq studied English and Christianity for several years. He was appointed by the Bishop of Newfoundland Edward Feild to accompany him on religious missions to the Inuit of Labrador.

The two warships under Franklin's command, HMS Erebus and HMS Terror, were trapped by ice in the Victoria Strait. The ships were abandoned in April 1848, and all remaining crew members presumably died while attempting to traverse the Canadian Arctic mainland.

Petersen inquired for information relating to Franklin's expedition, but the relatively large number of European ships previously sighted in the region, coupled with the Inughuit's great excitement aboard the vessel, resulted in no useful information, and the Inughuit returned to shore.\nCape York landing\nThe following day, Prince Albert and HMS Assistance spotted the same group of Inughuit.

A landing party including Charles Forsyth and Captain Erasmus Ommanney went to shore aboard HMS Intrepid, followed by the other ships. They were greeted by two young men, including Qalaherriaq. However, none of the landing party could speak Inuktun, and were unable to communicate with the band ashore. Shortly afterwards, the party was joined by Sir John Ross and his Kalaallit interpreter Adam Beck, who had arrived aboard Felix. After a long conversation, the only ship that could be readily identified from the Inughuit accounts was North Star, a supply ship which had passed through the region during another search for Franklin's expedition.\nUpon the officers' return to their ships, Beck became noticeably distressed. He explained that the Inughuit mentioned an additional ship that had passed through the area in 1846 staffed by naval officers, which was massacred by another Inughuit band while camping ashore at Wolstenholme Fjord. After Ommanney and Petersen were informed of the story, they had Beck repeat the story to various officers. Ommanney boarded Lady Franklin and relayed the story to Penny.

When the Inughuit repeated the same information about North Star to the explorers and denied any violence against the British, Petersen was convinced that Beck had confused the information about North Star with Franklin's expedition. Ommaney recruited Qalaherriaq to serve as an interpreter.\nInterpreter service\nOmmanney's diary described Qalaherriaq as readily volunteering to go with the expedition, without even returning to camp to gather his possessions. Nineteenth century sources state that he was fully ready to  remain under the captain's own personal care, and be with him always , and that he had stoically accepted his role as an interpreter due to a lack of surviving family. However, this account has been heavily disputed by later scholarship. Significant contradictions exist between period descriptions of Qalaherriaq's decision to volunteer. Explorer William Parker Snow's 1851 account, Voyage of the Prince Albert in Search of Sir John Franklin, describes him as a  young man without father or mother , while Petersen's 1857 Erindringer Fra Polarlandene describes him as being unbothered by leaving his mother.

Upon cross-questioning, Beck repeated what he claimed the Inughuit had told him, but Qalaherriaq insisted that he was lying. Communication between the two was limited due to linguistic differences between Qalaherriaq's Inuktun and Beck's Greenlandic. Qalaherriaq was able to communicate with Petersen much easier than with Beck.

While he was described as drawing them single-handedly, biographer Peter Martin states that Qalaherriaq  certainly did not do so alone . The maps were drawn according to European cartography, and do not reflect Inuit geography or mapping, such as the Ammassalik wooden maps.

When the crew encountered several abandoned igloos at the site of Uummannaq at North Star Bay, they found a heaped pile of seven bodies. The survivors were assumed to have fled the area without burying the dead due to the disease outbreak. The crew excavated several graves, finding the bodies of both Inuit and British seamen from North Star who had contracted the disease.\nOmmanney and his men proceeded to loot the graves and nearby huts for Inughuit artefacts. A British officer examined a grave and removed a narwhal tusk spear that had placed atop the grave as a form of Inughuit grave artifact. Qalaherriaq cried and begged him to put the spear back, recognizing the grave as being that of his father, Qisunnguaq. The grave was repaired by another officer and the spear, considered in Inughuit customs to be used by the dead for protection in the afterlife, was returned.\nWith sea conditions rendering return to Cape York impossible, Assistance crossed Baffin Bay and wintered at Griffith Island, near the present location of Resolute.

The loss of an adolescent son, expected to hunt for the family, would place a great material burden on his mother and siblings. This was especially true during an era marked by severe hardship for the Inughuit, characterized by population decline, widespread disease outbreaks, and extreme isolation from outside trade or contact.\nEngland\nQalaherriaq arrived in England in the autumn of 1851 aboard Assistance, and was brought to the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. In October 1851, he visited the Great Exhibition in London alongside Reverend George Murray, secretary of the Society, one of a small group of clergy and officers who served as caretakers to Qalaherriaq.\nIn around late 1851, Qalaherriaq sat for a life-size double portrait by an unknown artist, which some decades later was donated for display at the Royal Navy College in Greenwich.

After familiarizing himself with the cause and the circumstances of his Serbian fame, the mostly unemployed 48-year-old Stewart, along with a filmmaker friend Marc Vespi and his sister Liza, decided to attempt to make Slaughter Nick for President, a documentary about it. To that end, they contacted the band Atheist Rap and it was soon arranged for Rob to appear on stage as their guest at the To Be Punk Festival in Novi Sad on June 6.\nBy late March 2009 the news was leaked to Serbian press and several media outlets carried items that Rob Stewart would be coming to Serbia in May or early June as guest of Atheist Rap in order to film a documentary on his character's popularity in the country during the 1990s.

Despite his flaws, Slaughter was however brave, honest and caring. Stewart noted that the Serbs have a very  self-deprecating  sense of humor, so Slaughter's bumbling idiot qualities appealed to them. Stewart also noted during his visit to Serbia that he was told by countless people that they loved the character because of his indomitable qualities and his refusal to give up, which matches with the Serb self-image.\nAs a result of their June 2009 stay in Belgrade and Novi Sad, a six-minute documentary promo was put together and entered in the Roma Fiction Fest in Rome, Italy on July 8, 2009 under the  work in progress  section.\nMovie sequel\nTwo episodes of the show were re-edited into a feature-length film, Criss Cross.

Although a long-time admirer of the Sherlock Holmes stories, Mitani was initially reluctant to adapt them for puppetry due to the difficulty of conveying investigative details through puppet performance. He was also concerned that it might be too late to produce a Sherlock Holmes adaptation, given the enduring popularity of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and the acclaim already received by the modern series Sherlock.\nMitani initially considered creating a puppet closely resembling Sidney Paget's famous illustrations of Holmes",

He ultimately decided to set the story in a fictional boarding school called  Beeton School , reimagining Sherlock Holmes as a fifteen-year-old schoolboy. Although many incidents occur within the school, the series contains no murders, and the same puppets are reused throughout.\nAccording to Mitani, as the story progresses, viewers gradually come to understand the reason the series is set in a school. All four of Arthur Conan Doyle's novels   A Study in Scarlet, The Sign of the Four, The Hound of the Baskervilles, and The Valley of Fear   are dramatised in the puppetry. Mitani has stated that this may be the first adaptation to dramatise all four novels within a single series.\nAt a press conference in March 2014, Mitani remarked that only true Sherlockians would enjoy the series. Although this comment attracted criticism, he later clarified that what he meant was that genuine Sherlockians possess a sense of playfulness and open-mindedness that allows them to appreciate any adaptation of the Sherlock Holmes canon, and that the source material is rich enough to inspire creative derivative works.\nMitani also emphasised the importance",

He described Watson as possessing warmth and passion that Holmes lacks, and expressed admiration for Martin Freeman's good-natured portrayal of Watson in Sherlock. In 2007, Freeman appeared in the stage play The Last Laugh, based on Mitani's play University of Laughs (Warai no daigaku, 笑の大学).\nPuppets and sets\nMitani stated that anything performed by a human can also be performed by a puppet. The puppets used in the series were designed by painter Bunta Inoue. To emphasise Holmes's intelligence, Inoue designed the character with large ears and a broad forehead, while also giving him a distinctive nose reminiscent of the original illustrations. Mitani provided Inoue with detailed guidance on the puppets' appearance. For instance, the designs of Sir Henry Baskerville and Stapleton, characters from the episode based on The Hound of the Baskervilles, were modelled on Prince William and Woody Allen, respectively.\nInoue explained that he aimed to make the puppets appealing to children and to inspire them to create their own doodles.

He also served as a judge for an illustration contest featuring this series and The Three Musketeers, held in Edogawa Ward, Tokyo, in September 2014. The faces of the puppets are generally expressionless, with emotion conveyed primarily through lighting effects, similar to techniques used in Noh and Bunraku theatre. The hair of male puppets is painted in bright, carousel-like colours, while shibori dyeing techniques are used for the hair of female puppets.\nAs the series is produced in Japan, washi paper is frequently used in the construction of sets and props, including bags, tea sets, and lanterns illuminated by LED lamps. Washi is also used for trees and interior decorations, often combined with cheesecloth and nonwoven fabric to create a natural and warm atmosphere. Nonwoven fabric is particularly valued for preventing light reflection during filming. The overall appearance of the set resembles that of a dollhouse, with the cloister modelled on that of an abbey in the Cotswolds.

These colours are reflected in the pupils' uniforms. Holmes wears the dark blue uniform of Baker House and displays a clock and a pair of compasses on his left chest, while Watson continues to wear the pale brown uniform of his former school. In Inoue's original sketches, Holmes carries a cane topped with a skull, and the words  Sherlock Holmes  are inscribed on the soles of his shoes using the stick figure characters from The Adventure of the Dancing Men.\nVoice acting\nFor the selection of voice actors, Mitani asked the experienced actor Koichi Yamadera to voice Holmes, recognising that considerable acting skill was required to portray the complex character. Mitani has praised Yamadera for performing the role as if he were a boy who is naive and sensitive, despite not being so in reality.\nAs with The Three Musketeers, some voice actors perform multiple roles in the series.

Nano, a singer and fan of the Sherlock Holmes series, performed and wrote the lyrics for the opening theme,  Scarlet Story , which is inspired by A Study in Scarlet. The song seeks to convey Holmes's inner struggles as he relentlessly pursues the truth.\nThe series is produced using prescoring, and projection mapping is employed in the title sequence to illustrate  The Adventure of the Dancing Men .\nPlayfulness\nAs with Mitani's other works, playfulness is a notable element of the series. For example, the episode adapted from The Sign of the Four is presented as a musical play; in The Adventure of the Speckled Band, each speckle on the snake is shaped like a crocus, the flower mentioned by Holmes in the original story. Additionally, Holmes's violin is placed on a shelf among his personal belongings near his bed. Some words and dialogue in the series appear to reference the modern series Sherlock.\nCast",

Despite their championship drought, the Patriots remained a dominant NFL dynasty throughout the 2000s and early 2010s. They qualified for the playoffs nine times (missing only the 2008 postseason despite finishing 11 5), reached the AFC Championship five times, appeared in two Super Bowls, and, in the eyes of many, solidified Tom Brady's status as one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time. In 2007, the Patriots completed just the second undefeated regular season in the history of the modern NFL (the first being their division rival Miami Dolphins in 1972), as well as the first since the league expanded its seasons to sixteen games (though only the 1972 Dolphins were able to win the Super Bowl). The team's continued success over more than a decade drew a great deal of intrigue toward the ball club, and with it, constant media scrutiny.

Both teams punted on their initial second-half possession, but on 2nd and 7 on the Patriots' next possession, Tamba Hali, almost completely untouched by left tackle Nate Solder, strip-sacked Brady and recovered for Kansas City at the Patriots' 9. Two plays later, Smith threw a quick pass to Charles out of the backfield for a touchdown, Charles' third, increasing Kansas City's lead to 24 0. On the Patriots' second play of their next drive, a miscommunication between Brady and Edelman led to an interception by Sean Smith, who returned the ball 34 yards to the New England 13-yard line.

With the loss, the Patriots' record dropped to 2 2. In his regular press conference the ensuing Wednesday, when asked about the loss (primarily by Albert Breer), Belichick replied several times with his now famous line,  We're on to Cincinnati , which Tom Brady would repeat himself on his Twitter account in 2019 following a loss to the Chiefs with a scheduled game against the Bengals the following week. The Patriots would proceed to win ten of their final twelve regular-season games, clinch the  1 seed, win the AFC Championship, and win the Super Bowl, making that quote a piece of Patriots lore. Following their Super Bowl victory over the Seahawks, several Patriots players, including Brady himself, pointed to this game as the turning point in the Patriots' season.\nWeek 5: vs. Cincinnati Bengals\nAfter the Kansas City loss many analysts believed not only was the Patriots season over, but so was their 13-year dynasty.

A wave of public criticism of the organization on national and local media (led by scathing analyses by Trent Dilfer and former Patriot Tedy Bruschi, including a disputed report before the game of a confrontation between Josh McDaniels and receiver Aaron Dobson), the Patriots faced the 3 0 Bengals, the last remaining undefeated team, on Sunday Night Football.\nThe Patriots wasted no time against the Bengals highly touted defense, storming 80 yards in 10 plays, including Brady running for 4 yards on 4th-and-1, with Ridley scoring on a 1-yard touchdown run. The Bengals responded by driving to the Patriots 29, but Mike Nugent missed a 52-yard field goal. Taking over at their own 42, the Patriots raced 58 yards in only 6 plays, scoring on Brady's 17-yard touchdown pass to Tim Wright, increasing the lead to 14 0.

Following a Bears three-and-out, Edelman's 49-yard return plus a 10-yard holding penalty on the Bears' Trevor Scott set the Patriots up at the Bears 9. On the first play, Brady hit LaFell for a 9-yard touchdown. On the first play of the ensuing Chicago possession, Cutler was strip-sacked by rookie defensive end Zach Moore with Rob Ninkovich recovering and returning it 15 yards for a touchdown, giving the Patriots a 38 7 blowout lead.

This was his 17th career game with four touchdowns and zero interceptions, which tied him with Drew Brees for the most all time. In addition, this was his 43rd career game with 3 touchdowns and zero interceptions, which placed him second by Peyton Manning. On top of that, he threw for 354 yards. The Patriots totaled 122 yards rushing as well. Gronkowski and LaFell combined for 20 catches for 273 yards and four touchdowns, with both catching every ball thrown to them. Jay Cutler actually played well, completing 20 of 30 passes for 220 yards and three touchdowns, but threw an interception and lost a fumble. Matt Forte was fantastic, rushing for 114 yards on just 19 carries with a receiving touchdown.

It is located south of the Moncayo Massif between the valleys of the Jalón and the Aranda rivers, rising north of the N-234 road, roughly between Calatayud and Torrelapaja.\nGeography\nThe ridge is aligned in a NW-SE direction. Its highest point is Cabrera (1,433 m); other important summits are Virgen de la Sierra (1,413 m), Cucuta (1,300 m), San Cristóbal (1,264 m), Pico de Morés (1,186 m) and Monte de la Lezna (1,173 m). The adjacent Sierra de Vicort stretches east of Sierra de la Virgen in the same direction.\nThe name of this mountain chain derives from the Santuario de la Virgen de la Sierra, a Virgin Mary shrine located in the heights of the mountain range, about 22 km to the north of Villarroya de la Sierra town.\nThese mountains are mostly covered with low maquis shrub and they have been repopulated with pine since the 20th century. The Sierra de la Virgen is often subject to wildfires in periods of prolonged drought. Native trees include juniper and Carrasca (Quercus ilex), among others.\nThere are other smaller mountain chains named  Sierra de la Virgen  in Spain. One is in Ciudad Real Province, part of the Montes de Toledo, and the other is located in Córdoba Province, Andalusia.\nSee also\nMountains of Aragon\nAranda Comarca\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Sierra de la Virgen at Wikimedia Commons\nSierra de la Virgen - Tourism in Aragon\nHiking in Sierra de la Virgen",

Before a strict isolationist country, Korea began to open up in the second half of the 19th century.\nFollowing the Japan Korea Treaty of 1876, the Empire of Japan established the first post office in Japanese consulate district within the open port of Busan. Hong Yeong-shik, a reformist official during the late Joseon dynasty, remonstrated that the Japanese government is operating postal services in Busan without consent. At the same time, Hong also had an interest in postal services and whilst visiting Japan and the United States as a diplomatic delegation, he chose to inspect local post offices and learn the workings of postal system. On April 22, 1884, the first Korean post office, Ujeongchongguk (우정총국), was set up in Seoul and Hong became the first Postmaster-General.\nPrior to the beginning of postal services, Korea signed postal treaties with Japan and British Hong Kong, and further intended to join Universal Postal Union. Postal services in Korea officially began on November 18, 1884, when a service was established between Seoul and Incheon. After Korea was annexed by Japan in 1910, the Japanese government took over postal services and brought Japanese stamps for use in Korea.\nStamps of Joseon dynasty\nKorea issued its own stamps on November 18, 1884, when the first postal service was created",

In early 1886, unused stamps were granted to the Heinrich Constantin Eduard Meyer   Company, a German company based in Hamburg, to make payment for the cost of printing stamps to Japan.\nThe next series of stamps did not appear until 1895 when the postal service was reintroduced. The stamps of the 1895 series consisted of four values: 5, 10, 25 and 50 poon. All these stamps were printed by the Andrew B.

It was also in 1900 that the Korean Empire introduced a series of 13 stamps, with values ranging from 2 re to 2 won. These stamps are the first stamps printed in Korea and known to collectors as the  Plum Blossom stamps  because all the designs have a common theme of the plum blossom and taegeuk symbol. The frames are different for each value, and the three highest values are printed in two colours each. At that time, the plum blossom was adopted as a royal emblem, but the plum blossom emblem was used widely not only for a symbol for royal families but also for a national symbol.

Issuing these stamps were promoted by Jean Victor Emile Clemencet, a French postal service advisor to the government of Korea, and they were printed in Paris.

    "text": "Yurí (Jurí) is, or was, a language previously spoken near a stretch of the Caquetá River in the Brazilian Amazon, extending slightly into Colombia. It was spoken on the Puré River of Colombia, and the Içá River and Japurá River of Brazil.\nA small amount of data was collected on two occasions in the 19th century, published in 1853 and 1867. Kaufman (after Nimuendajú) notes that there is good lexical evidence to support a link with Ticuna in a Ticuna Yurí language family, though the data had never been explicitly compared as of 2010.\nIt is commonly assumed that the Yuri people and language survive among the uncontacted people or peoples of the Rio Puré region, now the Río Puré National Park. Indeed,  Yuri  is often used as a synonym for the only named people in the area, the Carabayo.

The project was subject to much public debate and was revised repeatedly. \nTransCanada Corporation's third proposal, in 2006, was for 44 3-megawatt (MW) wind turbines strung along the ridges of Kibby Mountain and nearby Kibby Range. \nWhile still opposed by the advocacy group Friends of the Boundary Mountains, other environmental groups including the Appalachian Mountain Club, Maine Audubon, and Natural Resources Council of Maine announced their support for the project in 2007. \nAmong other conditions, TransCanada agreed not to develop wind facilities on approximately 1,324 acres (536 ha) of land above 2,700 feet (820 m) near the project area.\nOn January 15, 2008, Maine's Land Use Regulation Commission (LURC) unanimously approved TransCanada's preliminary development plan and rezoning request for 2,367 acres (958 ha). \nThe commission rejected another, smaller wind power project on Black Nubble but concluded that the Kibby mountains have  relatively low use by the public, and these mountains have not been designated as having regionally scenic significance. \nThe LURC gave final approval on July 10, 2008.\nThe wind farm   at a capacity of 132 MW, New England's largest   is expected to generate about 357 million kilowatt-hours (41 MW yr) of electricity annually. \nHalf the turbines were put online in October 2009, and the remainder in 2010. \nThe capital cost of the project has grown to approximately US  350 million. \nAn expansion, of perhaps 45 MW, is under consideration.\nSee also\nList of mountains in Maine\nWind power in Maine\n   References",

It was recorded remotely, with tracks compiled via the Internet.\nA free download demo track taken from the album, titled  Sister Marie Says , was released on 25 November 2009 and featured backing vocals from British classical crossover soprano Keedie Babb. The song dates to 1981 and was almost included on Universal (1996), but was shelved. The second track to be played from the record was  History of Modern (Part II) ; it was aired on 31 May 2010 on BBC Radio 6 Music.\nThe artwork for History of Modern was conceived by Peter Saville and designed by Four23. The title was devised by McCluskey after he took his daughter to an art exhibition called  The History of Modernism .\nRemixes and B-sides from the History of Modern sessions were included on the EP History of Modern (Part I) (2011).\nSingles\n If You Want It  was released as the first single on 6 September 2010.

The third single,  History of Modern (Part I)  was remixed in radio and extended forms, and was released on 28 February 2011.\nReception\nHistory of Modern received positive reviews. The Daily Telegraph critic Neil McCormick described the album as  extraordinarily good, a belting synth-pop classic crammed with catchy tunes and complicated lyrics about matters of life and death, art and philosophy.  Q were also complimentary, noting that OMD's  winning way with a rattling pop tune is timeless  and that the record  refines their sound and gives it a modern production tweak . A mildly favourable Roy Wilkinson of Mojo wrote,  As reiterated via his work for Atomic Kitten, singer Andy McCluskey rarely struggles for hooks . Conversely, BBC reviewer John Doran was unimpressed, stating,  A few highs aside, this is a poor return from the 80s hit-makers... it's not too late for OMD to stride all the way back to greatness. But this album isn't even a stumble in the right direction. \nClassic Pop ranked History of Modern fifth in their  Top 20 Reunion Albums , noting that it echoes OMD's  golden period  of the early 1980s.

    "text": "The M46 Patton is an American medium tank designed to replace the M26 Pershing and M4 Sherman. It was one of the U.S Army's principal medium tanks of the early Cold War, with models in service from 1949 until the mid-1950s. It was not widely used by U.S. Cold War allies, being exported only to Belgium, and only in small numbers to train crews on the upcoming M47 Patton.\nThe M46 was the first tank to be named after General George S. Patton Jr., commander of the U.S. Third Army during World War II and one of the earliest American advocates for the use of tanks in battle.\nHistory\nAfter World War II, most U.S. Army armored units were equipped with a mix of M4 Sherman and M26 Pershing tanks. Designed initially as a heavy tank, the M26 Pershing tank was reclassified as a medium tank after the war. The M26 was a significant improvement over the M4 Sherman in firepower and protection. Its mobility, however, was deemed unsatisfactory for a medium tank, as it used the same engine as the much lighter M4A3 and was plagued with an unreliable transmission.\nWork began in January 1948 on replacing the original power plant with the Continental AV1790-3 engine and Allison CD-850-1 cross-drive transmission. This design was initially called the M26E2, but modifications continued to accumulate; eventually, the Bureau",

This design was initially called the M26E2, but modifications continued to accumulate; eventually, the Bureau of Ordnance decided that the tank needed its own unique designation, the M46. The upgraded M26 received a new power plant and a main gun with a bore evacuator.\nUpon completion of the first model of the Detroit Tank Arsenal production line in November 1948, the M46 was christened after the late General George S. Patton Jr. By December the Army had ordered several hundred. In July 1950 Detroit Arsenal was producing Pershings and M46s at a rate of over a dozen a day. In August 1950 President Harry S. Truman authorized funding for increased M46 production as part of an expansion of the heavy tank development program.\nA total of 1,160 M46s of all variants were built.\nCombat service\nThe only American combat use of the M46 Patton was during the Korean War. On 8 August 1950, the first M46 Patton tanks, belonging to the 6th Tank Battalion, landed in South Korea. The M46 proved to be capable against North Korean T-34 medium tanks.

In Aberfeldy, the children were orphaned when their mother died in September 1884 and their father died just over a year later, in December 1885. Both parents are buried in the Aberfeldy Cemetery.

It features Alice Deejay singer Judith Anna Pronk in three different roles: a singer-dancer, a security guard, and a Greek woman. The music video uses the Hitradio mix of the song.\nSynopsis\nDuring the first part, it features Pronk and Alice Deejay dancers (Mila Levesque and Angelique Versnel) in the hallways of an empty, white building on a stormy night. Pronk, as a security guard, also roams around the area. She reaches a painting depicting a Greek woman, who is also Pronk, and stops to look at it, realising the resemblance between the two of them. The figure in the portrait blinks, and the guard steps inside. The next part of the video features many people dressed in ancient Greek apparel dancing in a temple with a statue; Pronk and her dancers are also there. The security guard is then shown arriving at a restroom. She sings next to a mirror as the Greek woman admires a man and feeds him grapes. As the guard exits the restroom, all the Greeks feed each other grapes and other fruits. In the final section of the video, Pronk sings and dances with her dancers. The video ends at the stormy building, showing the painting the security guard looked at previously, with Pronk inside now still.\nTrack listings\nCredits and personnel\nCredits are lifted from the Dutch CD single liner notes.\nStudio\nRecorded at Kamo Studio 1 (The Hague, Netherlands)\nPersonnel\nPronti and Kalmani   writing, production\nDanski and DJ Delmundo   executive production\nShop Around!   graphic design\nClaudine Grin   photography\nCharts\nCertifications\nRelease history\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\n Will I Ever  at Discogs (list of releases)",

Herrmann graduated from Wilmington High School in 1931, the University of Delaware in 1935 and the Georgetown University Law Center in 1939.\nHerrmann's first legal job after passing the bar was for Wilmington attorney Steward Lynch, for whom he worked until enlisting in the United States Army in 1942. In 1946, he was discharged as a major and served as an Assistant United States Attorney for three years until he was appointed to the Delaware Superior Court by Governor Elbert N. Carvel, taking office on January 12, 1951. Because the compensation was too low to pay for his sons' education, Herrmann resigned from that seat on April 15, 1958, to return to private practice with colleague William Duffy. In 1961, he made partner at Herrmann, Bayard, Brill   Russell and represented the State of Delaware in",

In 1961, he made partner at Herrmann, Bayard, Brill   Russell and represented the State of Delaware in its acquisition of property for Interstate 95.\nDelaware Supreme Court\nOn December 13, 1964, Carvel nominated Herrmann to succeed Chief Justice Charles L. Terry, Jr., but this move was strongly opposed by supporters of Daniel F. Wolcott, who instead received the appointment, with Herrmann becoming a justice. However, there was no opposition when Governor Sherman W. Tribbitt nominated Herrmann to succeed Wolcott, on August 9, 1973. Herrmann served in that capacity until his retirement, on July 31, 1985.\nJudicial reform\nDuring his twelve-year tenure, Herrmann was an advocate of modifying and uniting the courts of Delaware.\nBy 1978, the State of Delaware had a sharp increase in case filings and the waiting period between a civil case briefing and the time it was taken under submission by the court. Also, the Delaware Supreme Court was the only court of last resort in the United States with fewer than five members. In his June State of the Judiciary Address (which he established for chief justices), Herrmann called attention to the expansion of the Delaware Supreme Court. In October, the court expanded from three justices to five when Governor Pierre S. du Pont IV",

In October, the court expanded from three justices to five when Governor Pierre S. du Pont IV announced that William T. Quillen and Henry R. Horsey would fill the two additional seats.\nHerrmann's other court reform achievements include: initiating a yearly report on the state of the judiciary; prioritizing the disposition of criminal cases; ensuring that all judicial opinions show the time period between submission and decision; enlarging courthouse facilities; installing computer-based information systems; additional judge appointments and administrative personnel; increasing judicial compensation; establishing the Long Range Courts Planning Committee, Delaware Judicial Nominating Commission and Office of Disciplinary Counsel; amending the rules of the courts; creating public education programs concerning Delaware's legal system; and opening the Delaware Supreme Court to photographic and news coverage, all of which facilitated more uniformity within the State's system.\nNotable cases\nHerrmann and the court's opinion in Weinberger v.

Van Gorkom, the court held that a business is not protected under the business judgment rule if its directors neglect to make informed business decisions, thus breaching their fiduciary duty under Delaware corporate law. The landmark decision was met with criticism nationwide.\nPersonal life\nIn 1940, Herrmann married Zelda Kluger, with whom he was an active leader of the Jewish community. They had two sons: Stephen and Richard. Three days after their 40th wedding anniversary, Zelda died of cancer at the General Division Hospital. In 1985, Herrmann married Millicent  Mitzi  Herrmann.\nRetirement and death\nAfter retiring from his role as chief justice, Herrmann became a distinguished visiting professor at the Widener University School of Law. The new courses he created aimed to teach law students alternative procedures for resolving disputes and how to be better advocates in appellate court proceedings.\nHerrmann died suddenly from a heart attack in the Philadelphia International Airport in 1991. In 1996, the New Castle County Courthouse was renamed the Daniel L. Herrmann Courthouse in his honor. After the courts moved to a newly constructed courthouse the old courthouse was sold to a credit card company and his name was removed from the building.\nSee also\nList of Jewish American jurists\n   References",

Its exploration of friendship, life and death received mostly positive reviews.\nIt was adapted as the film The Room Next Door (2024) by Spanish filmmaker Pedro Almodóvar. It is his first film to be made in English.\nPlot\nBackground and writing\nThe novel's title comes from an essay by French writer Simone Weil from her book Waiting For God. The novel was published during the COVID-19 pandemic, though Nunez had completed the writing before the pandemic began.\nLike her earlier book, The Friend (2018), the book involves a suicide. Despite the difficulty of the themes explored in her books, Nunez deliberately includes comedic moments throughout her work. She has said  when  comedy is  left out of a work, something essential is missing. \nReception\nCritical reception\nHeller McAlpin, writing for NPR, praised the novel as a   ...  deeply humane reminder of the great solace of both companionship and literature . Critics compared the book favorably to Nunez's The Friend. McAlpin referred to the book as a  worthy followup  and  companion piece  to the 2018 book. Dwight Garner, writing for The New York Times, made a similar comparison, and praised the book as   ...  as good as 'The Friend,' if not better",

Dwight Garner, writing for The New York Times, made a similar comparison, and praised the book as   ...  as good as 'The Friend,' if not better. \nJoan Frank of The Washington Post notes that,  One's moved by the scope and pith of this novel's ambition, as it addresses our biggest questions by naming the particular   the way the dying recited what mattered to them in Wim Wenders's iconic film Wings of Desire. But most striking may be how Nunez's narrator transfigures, through deepening compassion, from a wry, circumspect observer into someone raked raw with hapless love for her vanishing friend  ...  Still, it's the here-and-now of What Are You Going Through that spears us, its chorale-like testimonies, their preemptive requiem. \nAnri Wheeler of The Boston Globe concludes by saying,  In the end, Nunez leaves some of the reader's biggest questions unanswered. What matters, as with Weil's question that opens the book, is the asking. In doing so, meaning is made. The narrator, and in turn the reader, are transformed. \nFilm adaptation\nWhat Are You Going Through was made into a film renamed The Room Next Door.

He was the founder of the Church of Christ (Holiness) U.S.A.\nLife\nJones was born in Floyd County, Georgia. He became a missionary Baptist preacher in Jackson, Mississippi, where he met Charles Harrison Mason in 1895. In 1896, Jones, Mason, and two other preachers held a faith healing revival in Jackson. The theory of entire sanctification as taught by the Wesleyan-Holiness movement was not accepted by the Baptists congregation, as Baptist hold to progressive sanctification. In 1897, Jones and Mason left their congregations and accepted the doctrine of Holiness Methodism. They started their own church, first preaching in supporters' homes and eventually in a former gin house.\nJones is the author of over 1000 hymns. Some of his known hymns which are still sung around the world are Deeper, Deeper; I Will Make the Darkness Light; Come Unto Me; Where Shall I Be; I'm Happy With Jesus Alone; and Jesus Only. He pastored churches in Arkansas, Mississippi, and California.\nIn 1907, there was a separation with Charles Mason and other ministers who returned from the Azusa Street Revival in Los Angeles led by William Joseph Seymour over the biblical interpretation of speaking in tongues as evidence of the baptism in the Holy Spirit.",

Mason carried the church name and approximately half of its congregation into Holiness Pentecostalism. In 1915, Elder Charles Mason, who became Bishop Charles Mason, incorporated the Church of God in Christ which he founded. On the other hand, the denomination that continued the Wesleyan teaching of the holiness movement first called itself 'the movement', and later Church of God, Church of Christ, Church of God in Christ, and Church of Christ (Holiness) U.S.A. the present name of the Church.\nIn 1909, the Christian Women Willing Workers (CWWW), now the United Christian Women's Ministries (UCWM) was established upon the recommendation of Sis. Maria Williams. Jones made his first trip to Los Angeles in 1915 to conduct a revival for Bishop William A. Washington and helped him organize and incorporate the Bethel Church of Christ (Holiness) U.S.A.\nIn 1916, Bishop Jones' wife, Fannie Brown, died in Little Rock, Arkansas.

He actively maintained the spiritual leadership and operated as Senior Bishop of the church until he fell ill in 1943 and underwent major surgery. Because of his declining health, he attended his last convention in 1944 in Chicago, Illinois, where he was elected Senior Bishop and President Emeritus of the National Convention for life.

He attended the George Street and Anderson Bay Schools in Dunedin and in 1928 he became a full-time student at the art school attached to the King Edward Technical College in Dunedin to study under R N Field. The same year Kennedy was a founding member of W.H.Allen and Field's art group, the Six and Four Club (six women, four men) a mix of teachers and students. The meetings required students to produce a work at the meeting followed by discussion. (A.K.C.Petersen R.N.Field: the Dunedin Years 1925 1945 Manawatu Art Gallery 1989, pg 26 ) While he was a student at the art school Kennedy met MT (Toss) Woollaston in 1932 and the two form a romantic relationship that lasted until Woollaston moved to Māpua.

In 1938 Kennedy and Colin McCahon biked from Dunedin to Nelson for the fruit picking season. They visited Woollaston who began his long friendship with McCahon. The poet Charles Brasch said of Kennedy,  He gave his friendship to other artists having abandoned painting himself as if to serve his friends.  Thanks to his art training Kennedy worked as an artist (illustrator) in the Public Health Department of the Otago Medical School. During World War II Kennedy was interned at Whitanui Detention Camp near Shannon as a conscientious objector. Although a Quaker, he had refused to plead at his hearing. While at the camp he became involved with a theatre group and produced plays including The Whitanui Detention Camp: Presentation of 'The Beautiful People', by William Saroyan. In 1948, Kennedy became the partner of Charles Brasch the poet and editor of the literary magazine Landfall. Brasch also had a passionate interested in the arts and together they went on to create an important collection of contemporary New Zealand art.\nArt career\nKennedy first publicly exhibited his paintings in 1934 in the New Zealand Society of Artists exhibition, Pioneer Hall Dunedin.

In reviewing the work Eros commented,  in Kennedy's Landscape a more reserved and subtle use of colour is made. His interest is obviously centred in the study of rhythm and form.  The Evening Star critic enthused,  An extremely sympathetic group of works by Rodney Kennedy. The two landscapes...show a rhythmical unity lacking in better painted pictures. The colour is sensitive and restrained. Such pictures repay more than a hurried glance and are keenly satisfying to one who looks for more than mere naturalism in a landscape. \nIn 1940 Kennedy joined other young artists, including Anne Hamblett, in removing their works at the opening of the Otago Art Society exhibition in protest at the Society refusing to hang a painting by Colin McCahon.\nTheatre career\nBy 1938 Kennedy's interests had moved toward theatre. Before World War II he and Colin McCahon with assistance from Doris Lusk had designed sets for the Left Book Club's production Karel Čapek's Insect Play. The production included Kennedy and McCahon's friend Ron O Reilly in the cast as an ant.

It appears at approximately the same time as the shrine cult and is roughly contemporaneous with the introduction of Atar as a divinity. There is no allusion to a temple of fire in the Avesta proper, nor is there any Old Persian word for one.\nThat the rituals of fire was a doctrinal modification and absent from early Zoroastrianism is also evident in the later Atash Nyash. In the oldest passages of that liturgy, it is the hearth fire that speaks to  all those for whom it cooks the evening and morning meal , which Boyce observes is not consistent with sanctified fire. The temple is an even later development: from Herodotus it is known that in the mid-5th century BCE the Zoroastrians worshipped to the open sky, ascending mounds to light their fires. Strabo confirms this, noting that in the 6th century, the sanctuary at Zela in Cappadocia was an artificial mound, walled in, but open to the sky, although there is no evidence whatsoever that the Zela-sanctuary was Zoroastrian. Although the  burning of fire  was a key element in Zoroastrian worship, the burning of  eternal  fire, as well as the presence of  light  in worship, was also a key element in many other religions.\nBy the Parthian Empire (250 BCE",

The second, the atroshan, were the  places of burning fire  which became more and more prevalent as the iconoclastic movement gained support. Following the rise of the Sassanid dynasty, the shrines to the Yazatas continued to exist, but with the statues   by law   either abandoned or replaced by fire altars.\nAlso, as Schippman observed, there is no evidence even during the Sassanid era (226 650 CE) that the fires were categorized according to their sanctity.  It seems probable that there were virtually only two, namely the Atash-i Vahram  literally:  victorious fire , later misunderstood to be the Fire of Bahram , and the lesser Atash-i Adaran, or 'Fire of Fires', a parish fire, as it were, serving a village or town quarter .

Apparently, it was only in the Atash-i Vahram that fire was kept continuously burning, with the Adaran fires being annually relit. While the fires themselves had special names, the structures did not, and it has been suggested that  the prosaic nature of the middle Persian names (kadag, man, and xanag are all words for an ordinary house) perhaps reflect a desire on the part of those who fostered the temple-cult ... to keep it as close as possible in character to the age-old cult of the hearth-fire, and to discourage elaboration . Sasanian coins always depicted a fire altar with flames on the reverse.\nThe Battle of al-Qādisiyyah (636 CE) and the Battle of Nihavānd (642 CE) were instrumental to the collapse of the Sassanid Empire and state-sponsored Zoroastrianism; destruction or conversion (mosques) of some fire temples in Greater Iran followed. The faith was practiced largely by the aristocracy but large numbers of fire temples did not exist. Some fire temples continued with their original purpose although many Zoroastrians fled.

Legend says that some took fire with them and it most probably served as a reminder of their faith in an increasingly persecuted community since fire originating from a temple was not a tenet of the religious practice.\nArchaeological traces\nThe oldest remains of what has been identified as a fire temple are those on Mount Khajeh, near Lake Hamun in Sistan. Only traces of the foundation and ground-plan survive and have been tentatively dated to the 3rd or 4th century BCE. The temple was rebuilt during the Parthian era (250 BCE   226 CE), and enlarged during Sassanid times (226 650 CE).\nThe characteristic feature of the Sassanid fire temple was its domed sanctuary where the fire-altar stood. This sanctuary always had a square ground plan with a pillar in each corner that then supported the dome (the gombad). Archaeological remains and literary evidence from Zend commentaries on the Avesta suggest that the sanctuary was surrounded by a passageway on all four sides.  On a number of sites the gombad, made usually of rubble masonry with courses of stone, is all that survives, and so such ruins are popularly called in Fars čahār-tāq or 'four arches'. \nRuins of temples of the Sassanid era have been found in various parts of the",

Many more ruins are popularly identified as the remains of Zoroastrian fire temples even when their purpose is of evidently secular nature, or are the remains of a temple of the shrine cults, or as is the case of a fort-like fire temple and monastery at Surkhany, Azerbaijan, that unambiguously belongs to another religion. The remains of a fire-altar, most likely constructed during the proselytizing campaign of Yazdegerd II (r. 438 457) against the Christian Armenians, have been found directly beneath the main altar of the Echmiadzin Cathedral, the Mother See of the Armenian Apostolic Church.\nLegendary Great Fires\nApart from relatively minor fire temples, three were said to derive directly from Ahura Mazda, thus making them the most important in Zoroastrian tradition.

Other texts observe that the Great Fires were also vehicles of propaganda and symbols of imperial sovereignty.\nThe priests of these respective  Royal Fires  are said to have competed with each other to draw pilgrims by promoting the legends and miracles that were purported to have occurred at their respective sites.

These divisions are archaeologically and sociologically revealing, because they make clear that, since from at least the 1st century BCE onwards, society was divided into four, not three, feudal estates.\nThe Farnbag fire (translated as 'the fire Glory-Given' by Darmesteter) was considered the most venerated of the three because it was seen as the earthly representative of the Atar Spenishta, 'Holiest Fire' of Yasna 17.11, and it is described in a Zend commentary on that verse as  the one burning in Paradise in the presence of Ohrmazd. \nAlthough  in the eyes of  contemporary  Iranian Zoroastrian priests, the three fires were not 'really existing' temple fires and rather belonged to the mythological realm , several attempts have been made to identify the locations of the Great Fires.

That the temple once stood in Khwarezm is also supported by the Greater (Iranian) Bundahishn and by the texts of Zadsparam (11.9).

This ash, it is said, served as the bed for the fire today at Udvada.\nThis fire temple was not always at Udvada. According to the Qissa-i Sanjan, 'Story of Sanjan', the only existing account of the early years of Zoroastrian refugees in India and composed at least six centuries after their arrival, the immigrants established a Atash-Warharan, 'victorious fire' (see Warharan for etymology) at Sanjan. Under threat of war (probably in 1465), the fire was moved to the Bahrot Caves 20 km south of Sanjan, where it stayed for 12 years.

It was then moved to Udvada where it burns today.\nAlthough there are numerous eternally burning Zoroastrian fires today, with the exception of the 'Fire of Warharan', none of them are more than 250 years old. The legend that the Indian Zoroastrians invented the afrinagan (the metal urn in which a sacred fire today resides) when they moved the fire from Sanjan to the Bahrot Caves is unsustainable. Greek historians of the Parthian period reported the use of a metal vase-like urn to transport fire. Sassanid coins of the 3rd-4th century CE likewise reveal a fire in a vase-like container identical in design to the present-day afrinagans.

The etymology of this term, meaning 'Mithra's Gate' or 'Mithra's Court' is problematic. It has been proposed that the term is a throwback to the age of the shrine cults, the name being retained because all major Zoroastrian rituals were solemnized between sunrise and noon, the time of day especially under Mithra's protection. Etymological theories see a derivation from mithryana (so Meillet) or  mithradana (Gershevitch) or mithraion (Wilcken). It is moreover not clear whether the term referred to a consecrated inner sanctum or to the ritual precinct.\nAmong present-day Iranian Zoroastrians, the term darb-e mehr includes the entire ritual precinct. It is significantly more common than the older atashkada, a Classical Persian language term that together with its middle Persian predecessors (𐭪𐭲𐭪 𐭠𐭲𐭧𐭱 ātaxš-kadag, -man and -xanag) literally means 'house of fire'.

Until the 17th century the fire (now) at Udvada was the only continuously burning one on the Indian subcontinent. Each of the other settlements had a small building in which rituals were performed, and the fire of which the priests would relight whenever necessary from the embers carried from their own hearth fires. The Parsis called such an unconsecrated building either dar-be mehr or agiary. The latter is the Gujarati language word for 'house of fire' and thus a literal translation of atashkada. In recent years, the term dar-be mehr has come to refer to a secondary sacred fire (the dadgah) for daily ritual use that is present at the more prestigious fire temples.

There are three grades of fires, the Atash Dadgah, Atash Adaran, and Atash Behram.\nAtash Dadgah\nThe Atash Dadgah is the lowest grade of sacred fire, and can be consecrated within the course of a few hours by two priests, who alternatingly recite the 72 verses of the Yasna liturgy. Consecration may occasionally include the recitation of the Vendidad, but this is optional. A lay person may tend the fire when no services are in progress. The term is not necessarily a consecrated fire, and the term is also applied to the hearth fire, or to the oil lamp found in many Zoroastrian homes.\nAtash Adaran\nThe next highest grade of fire is the Atash Adaran, the  Fire of fires .

Eight priests are required to consecrate an Adaran fire and the procedure takes between two and three weeks.\nAtash Behram\nThe highest grade of fire is the Atash Behram  Fire of victory , and its establishment and consecration is the most elaborate of the three. It involves the gathering of sixteen different  kinds of fire , that is, fires gathered from 16 different sources, including lightning, fire from a pyre, fire from trades where a furnace is operated, and fires from the hearths as is also the case for the Atash Adaran.

This may reflect ancient tradition (supported by the prosaic nature of the technical terms for a fire temple) that the principal purpose of a fire temple is to house a sacred fire, and not to glorify what is otherwise simply a building.\nThe basic structure of present-day fire temples is always the same. There are no indigenous sources older than the 19th century that describe an Iranian fire temple (the 9th century theologian Manushchir observed that they had a standard floor plan, but what this might have been is unknown), and it is possible that the temples there today have features that are originally of Indian origin. On entry one comes into a large space or hall where congregation (also non-religious) or special ceremonies may take place.

Fire Temple attendance is particularly high during seasonal celebrations (Gahambars), and especially for the New Year (Noruz).\nThe priesthood is trigradal.

Ordinary priests have the title of mobad, and are able to conduct the congregational worship and such occasional functions as marriages. A mobad must be the son, grandson, or great-grandson of a mobad. The lowest rank is that of herbad, or ervad; these assist at the principal ceremonies.\nGallery\nSee also\nAzargoshnasp fire temple\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\nBoyce, Mary (1975),  On the Zoroast",

It came into conflict with the German government in Berlin after an agreement to end a general strike in the region failed. Reichswehr and Freikorps units put down the rebellion with considerable brutality, including summary executions of prisoners and the killing of wounded fighters. The Ruhr Red Army was defeated by 6 April and many surviving members fled to the French-occupied Rhineland.\nFormation\nOn 13 March 1920, the Kapp Putsch was launched by right-wing elements to overthrow the elected government of the Weimar Republic. The majority of Germany's left-of-centre political parties and trade unions responded with a call for a nationwide general strike. It drew around 12 million workers and was largely responsible for the quick failure of the attempted coup by 18 March. Chancellor Gustav Bauer of the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), the largest party of the ruling Weimar Coalition, called off the strike. A schism between the centre-left and far-left parties soon became apparent.",

A schism between the centre-left and far-left parties soon became apparent. In the Ruhr, a heavily industrialised region in western Germany, many far-left workers and union officials did not stop with the strike once the Kapp Putsch failed. They spontaneously formed executive councils (Vollzugsräte) that took power over local governments after disarming the local Security Police and Reichswehr forces. By 22 March, the entire Ruhr district was in their effective control. The executive councils would utilise local workers' defence (Arbeiterwehr) which armed themselves with weapons from Citizens' Defense (Einwohnerwehr) groups. It was from these workers' defence groups that the Red Ruhr Army was soon formed. On 15 March, the government sent the Freikorps Lichtschlag to suppress the uprising but, despite being better armed, were greatly outnumbered and defeated two days later. Their weapons, including artillery pieces, and 600 members were captured.\nAt its peak the, Red Ruhr Army's strength is estimated to have been 50,000 to 80,000 members, mostly striking workers with ties to far-left organisations.

The agreement called for the Red Ruhr Army to hand over its weapons, with a promise of amnesty for those who had broken the law in defence of the government against the Kapp Putsch. Leaders of the Red Ruhr Army, however, thought that it would be better to fight against the government than accept the compromises in the agreement. At a meeting a week later, on 1 April, the leaders of the Red Ruhr Army agreed that there was no point in continuing the fight, but it had by then splintered into numerous, largely independent groups over which the leaders had no control.

In addition, urgent calls for help were coming in from local citizens and city administrations reporting that Red Ruhr Army members were engaging in extortion, looting and shootings. \nOn 2 April, the government sent in both Reichswehr and Freikorps troops, who were experienced and heavily armed, into the Ruhr. The uprising was quickly crushed with mass arrests and shootings without it always being clear whether the victims were members of the Red Ruhr Army or not. Wounded fighters were shot, as were ten female medics with the Red Ruhr Army who were carrying pistols. Many fighters were reported as having been shot while fleeing, indicating that they were shot in the back. Around 50 had been summarily executed and an additional 205 condemned by drumhead courts before the government in Berlin forbade them on 3 April. General Oskar von Watter, who was in charge of government troops in the Ruhr, defended himself from other charges that his men had engaged in unlawful behaviour by citing a letter from the Ministry of the Reichswehr that stated,  You are given complete freedom to do what the situation demands .\nOn 5 April, a large part of the surviving Red Ruhr Army fled to the French occupied zone of the Rhineland. The skirmish that took place in Gelsenkirchen the next day marked the final end of the uprising and of the Red Ruhr Army. The number of insurgents killed has never been accurately determined. Historian Heinrich August Winkler puts the number at  well over 1,000 , the majority of them killed after being captured. The Reichswehr lost 208 killed and 123 missing; the Security Police 41 dead. The number of Freikorps deaths has been put at 273.\nSee also\nHans Marchwitza\nWilhelm Zaisser\n   References",

The village is located within Chesaning Township.\nHistory\nThe first mention of Chesaning in the written pages of history is the Saginaw Treaty, signed in 1819. This treaty was between members of the Saginaw Tribe, Chippewa Indians, and the government of the United States. They established a number of reservations, including 10,000 acres (40 km2) along the banks of the Shiawassee River known as  Big Rock Reserve.  Chesaning is a Chippewa word meaning  big rock place . The treaty continued in effect until 1837 when a second treaty led to the reserve being surveyed and offered for sale in 1841. The first land was sold at  5 per acre to brothers Wellington and George W. Chapman, and Rufus Mason. After making their land purchase, they traveled back to Massachusetts and moved their families to their new wilderness home by late summer of 1842.\nDuring the months they had been away from their land, several settlers had moved into the area, building a dam and a sawmill. A few years later, a grinding mill was added. The new settlers named their community  Northampton  in honor of the home they had left in Massachusetts. In 1853,",

The new settlers named their community  Northampton  in honor of the home they had left in Massachusetts. In 1853, the legislature changed the name to Chesaning, the traditional name for the village and township. The first township elections, held in 1847, are considered to be the official birthday of the community. The village, first surveyed in 1851, was organized in 1869. The early business community was located on the east side of the river. The forest setting provided an abundance of lumber, which was used to construct many stores. However, the use of coal heating systems often caused major fires, which destroyed entire blocks of stores. The fires and the arrival of the railroad on the west side community influenced the business area to move on the west side of the river.\nThe Owosso and Saginaw Navigation Company, organized in 1857 to move merchandise by barge up and down the river, began construction of a canal and lock on the east side of the dam for hauling goods on the river. The river continued to be important for commercial use until the railroad arrived in Owosso.

About 7.0  of families and 9.7  of the population were below the poverty line, including 8.0  of those under age 18 and 12.4  of those age 65 or over.\nEducation\nEducation in Chesaning had its beginnings during the summer of 1843 when a small board shanty was built on the east side of the river. Eliza Ann Smith was the first teacher. She had 11 pupils, which included her five younger brothers. The first school year was brought to an end when a heavy rainstorm flooded the building and sent the teacher and pupils fleeing to higher ground. The school moved several times over the years, until 1869, when a brick school was built for  14,000. The building was enlarged a few years later. Then a second brick school was constructed on the site of the first brick school and opened in 1918. A gymnasium was added to the school in 1938 and a few years later, a band room. The present high school opened in 1959 and had a capacity of 1,000 students. The building was later enlarged to accommodate 1,200 students. Today, Chesaning Union Schools consists of a high school, a middle school and one elementary school. The district includes a large rural area.\nZion",

Founded in 1983, it is a weekly free paper delivered to over 19,000 area homes. Many residents also subscribe to The Saginaw News, The Bay City Times, the Flint Journal, or the Argus-Press out of neighboring Owosso.\nChesaning is an important location for broadcasters in Mid-Michigan, with the community being home to three nearly 1,000 foot communications towers. Flint's WJRT-TV and WSMH as well as Saginaw's WAQP have their antennas and transmitters south of Chesaning. The location gives broadcasters the ability to transmit strong signals to Flint, Saginaw, Bay City, and Lansing.\nRadio stations from Saginaw, Flint and Lansing can be received in Chesaning. Exceptionally strong local signals include WSGW, WTLZ, WKCQ and WILZ in Saginaw; WHNN and WIOG in Bay City; and WOAP and WRSR in Owosso.\nChesaning Showboat Music Festival\nChesaning was known for an annual event called the Showboat. This festival was canceled in July 2013, citing lack of funds. The Showboat Committee later filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection.\nReferences\nExternal links\nVillage of Chesaning Web Site\nChesaning Chamber\nRiver Rapids District Library, formerly Chesaning Public Library",

    "text": "Patterson   Francis Aviation Company was an American aircraft manufacturer and repair service in the earliest days of powered flight. The company started as the Patterson Aeroplane Company, based in San Francisco, California.\nIn 1912, Chas H. Patterson built and tested his own aircraft based on a Nieuport design. Later aircraft included twin tractor designs from his future partners, Roy Francis and Frank Bryant. Shortly afterward, production moved to 1410 Howard Street.\nPatterson built Nieuport style aircraft and custom parts for early aviators such as Fritz Schiller and E.F. De Villa. The company also built aircraft to compete for the Gordon Bennett Trophy. Allan Haines Loughead, co-founder of Lockheed, contracted Patterson for a float to be used on the first Loughead aircraft, the ALCO model G.\nIn 1913, the company produced a twin-propeller flying boat that competed in the 1913 Great Lakes Reliability Trophy. Competing against Glenn L. Martin, Francis earned 6722 points flying a route around the Great Lakes. The aircraft developed mechanical difficulties around Pentwater, leaving Francis with a twelve-hour train ride to get parts to continue.\nThe historical papers of the company are now held by the Burton Historical Collection of the Detroit Public Library.\nAircraft\n   References",

Some β3 agonists have demonstrated antistress effects in animal studies, suggesting it also has a role in the central nervous system (CNS). β3 receptors are found in the gallbladder, urinary bladder, and in brown adipose tissue. Their role in gallbladder physiology is unknown, but they are thought to play a role in lipolysis and thermogenesis in brown fat. In the urinary bladder it is thought to cause relaxation of the bladder and prevention of urination.\nMechanism of action\nBeta adrenergic receptors are involved in the epinephrine- and norepinephrine-induced activation of adenylate cyclase through the action of the G proteins of the type Gs.\nLigands\nAgonists\nApproved for clinical use\nMirabegron (YM-178), approved for treatment of overactive bladder in Japan, United States, UK, Canada, China and India.\nNebivolol selective beta(1)-blocker and beta(3)-agonist.\n",

    "text": "Prostaglandin-H2 D-isomerase (PTGDS) is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the PTGDS gene.\nFunction\nThe protein encoded by this gene is a glutathione-independent prostaglandin D synthase that catalyzes the conversion of prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) to prostaglandin D2 (PGD2). PGD2 functions as a neuromodulator as well as a trophic factor in the central nervous system. PGD2 is also involved in smooth muscle contraction relaxation and is a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation. This gene is preferentially expressed in brain. Studies with transgenic mice over-expressing this gene suggest that this gene may be also involved in the regulation of non-rapid eye movement sleep. Furthermore, PTGDS and its product PGD2 are elevated in the bald-scalp areas of men with male pattern baldness (androgenetic alopecia).\nClinical use\nProstaglandin D2 synthase is used clinically as a diagnostic marker for liquorrhea, that is, to check whether fluid leaking from the nose or ear contains cerebrospinal fluid. This is important in the assessment of head trauma severity. In a medical context, the older term  beta-trace protein  is frequently used to refer to PTGDS.\nSee also\nHematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase\nReferences\nFurther reading\nExternal links\nOverview of all the structural information available in the PDB for UniProt: P41222 (Human Prostaglandin-H2 D-isomerase) at the PDBe-KB.\nOverview of all the structural information available in the PDB for UniProt: O09114 (Mouse Prostaglandin-H2 D-isomerase) at the PDBe-KB.",

    "text": "Oral arguments are spoken presentations to a judge or appellate court by a lawyer (or parties when representing themselves) of the legal reasons why they should prevail. Oral argument at the appellate level accompanies written briefs, which also advance the argument of each party in the legal dispute. Oral arguments can also occur during motion practice when one of the parties presents a motion to the court for consideration before trial, such as when the case is to be dismissed on a point of law, or when summary judgment may lie because there are no factual issues in dispute.\nOral argument operates by each party in a case taking turns to speak directly to the judge or judges with an equal amount of time allotted to each. A party may often reserve part of their time to be used for rebuttal after their adversary has presented.\nPresenting lawyers usually cannot simply make speeches or read their briefs when presenting oral argument to an appellate court. Unlike trial court procedure, where judges intervene only when asked by the parties to resolve objections, it is typical for judges at the appellate level to be active participants in oral argument, interrupting the presenting lawyers and asking questions. This is true even of courts that are formed of panels of multiple judges, such as the United States Supreme Court, where a presenting lawyer must be prepared to handle questions from any of the nine justices. It is also true that when a motion is made before or during trial that the lawyers conduct themselves before the judge in a manner similar to the presentation of the case on appeal",

It is also true that when a motion is made before or during trial that the lawyers conduct themselves before the judge in a manner similar to the presentation of the case on appeal, the lawyers present their arguments to the judge in a more conversational mode; in some pre-trial proceedings these appearances may not be recorded by court stenographers as they are invariably recorded in appellate proceedings.\nOral argument is not always considered an essential part of due process, as the briefs also give the parties an opportunity to be heard by the court. Whether a court will permit, require, or guarantee the opportunity to present oral argument is a decision usually left up to each court to decide as part of its rules of procedure, with differences from court to court even within a single jurisdiction. Some courts may guarantee the right to present oral argument, either requiring the parties to request to present or their waiver if they do not wish to, while other courts may require oral argument without the ability to waive it. Courts may also have the discretion to decide a case without presentation of oral argument, rendering their judgment entirely based on the arguments set forth in the parties' briefs. David Tatel, judge in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, has referred to a  long-established rule  that contentions made for the first time at oral argument are  rarely considered .\nSee also\nClosing argument\n   Notes",

Of these, 4.1 million (8.9 ) were born outside the EU and 2.3 million (5.1 ) were born in another EU Member State.\nAs of 2005 Spain had the second highest immigration rates within the EU, just after Cyprus, and the second highest absolute net migration in the World (after the USA). \nOver 920,000 immigrants arrived in Spain during 2007, in addition to 802,971",

According to some analysts, the causes behind this are multiple. Drawing from the experience of many Spaniards during the 1960s and then again in the beginning of the 21st century when the crisis struck the country, there may be also a collective understanding that hardships force people to seek work abroad.\nA January 2004 survey by Spanish newspaper El País showed that the  majority  of Spaniards believe immigration was too high. Small parties, such as Movimiento Social Español, openly campaign using nationalist or anti-immigrant rhetoric as do other small far-right parties such as National Democracy (Spain) and España 2000. These parties have never won national or regional parliamentary seats. However, while the far-right political party Vox has gained headlines for favouring tough stance against immigration, commentators have suggested that this has not translated into electoral success for them.\nAccording to an October 2024 survey for the El País newspaper and Cadena SER radio station, 57  of Spaniards believe there is  too much  immigration",

The people of Troon asked the RNLI to provide one for their town, which they agreed to in 1871.  250 was paid to build a boathouse at the harbour on land donated by the Duke of Portland. \nA larger boat was stationed at Troon from 1905 so the boathouse was sold to the county council and the lifeboat since that time has been kept afloat in the harbour.

A boathouse was built for it and a davit erected to lower it into the water.\nService awards\nThree RNLI Medals have been awarded to members of Troon lifeboat crews.

In developing the album, guitarist Alex Wade stated that their aim was to  write our heaviest album to date. We wanted to put out something that was shockingly menacing and brutal.  During the recording sessions, the band made sure only to record on weekdays to save energy and rest during the weekends. On September 12, 2024, the first single,  A Visceral Retch  was released. On January 15, 2025, the second single,  Hymns in Dissonance , was released with a music video, along with the album announcement, release date and track list.\nComposition\nHymns in Dissonance is a concept album, detailing the story of a demonic cult and its leader, and his goal to transport to another dimension to gain power.

Blabbermouth wrote that  Hymns In Dissonance is the ghost of Whitechapel's past, resurrected and given body armor. Songs like 'Diabolic Slumber' and 'The Abysmal Gospel' dig their claws into old-school and melodic death metal more convincingly than ever before, while frenzied, full-pelt attacks like 'A Visceral Retch' and the brutally blackened 'Hate Cult Ritual' are manifestly heavier than anything the band have written in the past. And yet, thanks to the sheer authority that Whitechapel possess since they came of age, there is every reason to think that Hymns In Dissonance has the same breakthrough potential as The Valley and Kin, and maybe even more. The sound of one of modern metal's most heavyweight propositions throwing their weight around and wrecking the place is irresistible and hugely impressive. Maturity can wait.

Other raucous styles are drawn into the maelstrom: new drummer Brandon Zackey blasts 'The Abysmal Gospel' into grind territory, while 'Hate Cult Ritual' is infected with the demonic theatricality of black metal. The band s songwriting accommodates both the frenzied and the epic, and if no melody escapes Phil s throat, guitarist Ben Savage balances things out with glistening leads on 'Mammoth God' and 'Nothing Is Coming For Any Of Us'.

Vicious, relentless, and masterfully crafted, this is one of the band s strongest releases to date.  Metal Epidemic spoke positively of the album, concluding that  They weren t lying when they said they were going to be channeling the spirit of early Whitechapel. However, they have nearly two decades of playing and songwriting under their belts that can t be taken out of the equation. So this is not Whitechapel trying to re-capture the lightning in a bottle that was the MySpace deathcore era. This is Whitechapel at the height of their powers, incorporating the brutal elements of their earlier works into the framework of the Whitechapel of the 2020s...and it s glorious. \nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nCredits sourced from the enclosed album booklet\nWhitechapel\nPhil Bozeman   vocals\nBen Savage   lead guitar\nZach Householder   guitar\nAlex Wade   guitar\nGabe Crisp   bass\nBrandon Zackey   drums\nAdditional personnel\nZach Householder   production, engineering\nDrew Fulk   mixing\nJeff Dunne lead guitar\nZach Householder   guitar\nAlex Wade   guitar\nGabe Crisp   bass\nBrandon Zackey   drums\nAdditional personnel\nZach Householder   production, engineering\nDrew Fulk   mixing\nJeff Dunne   mixing\nTed Jensen   mastering\nCharts\n   References",

    "text": "Lecture recording refers to the process of recording and archiving the content of a lecture, conference, or seminar. It consists of hardware and software components that work in synergy to record the audio and visual components of the lecture. It is widely used in universities and higher education in the UK and Australia to provide support for students. 71  of institutions responding to a UCISA survey in 2016 indicated that this technology was available in their institution. Where lecture recording is done at scale, the recording system may be integrated with the timetabling system and the collection of metadata may be automated.\nHardware\nHardware such as a lavalier microphone can be used to capture the lecturer's voice along with the video of the lecturer. Sometimes, the lecturer may use visual aids to support their speech, such as slide shows, which are presented to the audience with some kind of projector. In this case, such slide shows can also be recorded. Once captured, the data is then either stored directly on the capture hardware or sent to a server over a LAN or the Internet. After some processing to adapt the video formats to the desired distribution mechanism, codecs, etc., viewers are then able to remotely access the recording, either in live stream or video on demand.\nThe recording of a lecture or presentation may use any combination of the following tools: Microphone, Camera, Screen capture, Presentation capture, or Document camera.\nSoftware\nSoftware is used both on the capture hardware, the viewer's computer, and the",

Software ranges from simple web browsers and video players to stand-alone software programs made specifically for viewing lectures. The viewer's as well as the presenter's software must be compatible with the software on the server which receives the content from the capture hardware, produces it, and sends it to the viewer's computer on-demand. OpenCast is an open-source video capture system available in higher education.\nModern lecture recording software supports advanced features such as indexing through OCR, instant search, real-time video editing and annotation, along with other advanced features.\nUses\nLecture recording has been used in the flipped classroom learning model as a means to provide materials outside of traditional lectures or seminars. Students are able to self-study by playing back and interacting with recorded lectures.\nSome educational institutions use lecture recording as a means to replace the traditional classroom with an online classroom. Lecture recording can also be used to create reference materials as a supplementary resource. Lecture recording is not always welcomed by university faculty.

In the most part students watch lectures for pragmatic reasons rather than lecture quality. Students do not view recorded lectures as a replacement for attending live lectures, and often continue to attend face to face sessions. Students who use recorded lectures as a supplement sometimes score significantly higher in subsequent assessment.\nSome firms may also use lecture recordings as advertising, collaboration, or training materials.\nIn addition, lecture capture technology may offer compliance, for example with United States legislation such as Section 508 for students with disabilities. In the United Kingdom, under the Equality Act 2010, universities should provide reasonable adjustments. Providing access to lecture recordings may be considered to be such a reasonable adjustment.\nResearch\nLecture captures are becoming increasingly popular. Many institutions including the University of Manchester, University of Glasgow, University of Bristol and Loughborough University provide guidelines for recording and presentation of lectures which would be useful for learning and there is a growing literature that considers the benefits of lecture capture to students and tutors, as well as the extent of student usage of lecture recordings. Research at Cornell University found increased flexibility for students and faculty.\n   References",

Early in his research into artificial photosynthesis, he had discovered an Iridium-based catalyst which can also be used as an anti-corrosion coating for oil pipelines or to prevent lead from getting into wastewater during the metal refinery process.\nIn 2017, Sheehan co-founded Air Company with Gregory Constantine who he met the year before on a trip for Forbes 30 Under 30. Sheehan serves as chief technology officer of the company which produces ethanol-based products using heterogeneous catalysis to hydrogenate carbon dioxide (CO2) to produce ethanol (C2H5OH). Unlike other catalysts used in hydrogenation, this catalyst contains no precious metals and produces ethanol sufficiently pure enough for use in beverages, foods, cosmetics, cleaning products, and fragrances with oxygen and water as the only byproducts.\nThe company released its first product, Air Vodka, in November 2019 in the New York City area. On July 27, 2022, a US Air Force drone fighter jet at the Hsu STEM Range in Laurel Hill, Florida, took the first unmanned flight powered by fuel produced entirely from carbon dioxide using Sheehan's technology.

This fish is the northernmost species in the genus Hyphessobrycon, as well as its type species.\nDescription\nThe Mayan tetra is a silver fish with clear fins. They express minimal sexual dimorphism, with males being slightly darker than females. The base of the dorsal fin is black in coloration. These fish are known to grow up to 4 to 4.5 centimetres (1.6 to 1.8 in) in length. It is similar in shape to the black phantom tetra, although it is slightly slimmer in appearance.\nDistribution and habitat\nThe Mayan tetra is known to inhabit the Papaloapan River Basin in southern Mexico, as well as Belize and northern Guatemala.\nThey live in waters ranging from 23 to 26  C (73 to 79  F). As a benthopelagic fish, they reside away from the surface of the water.\nDiet\nIt is presumed that the Mayan tetra is an opportunistic omnivore.\nReferences\nFroese, Rainer; Pauly, Daniel (eds.).

He played with the Port Arthur Lake City team in the New Ontario Hockey League (NOHL) from 1907 1912. On March 16, 1911, he and teammate Eddie Carpenter played for the Port Arthur Hockey Club against the Ottawa Senators of the National Hockey Association (NHA) for the Stanley Cup. Carpenter and Walker each scored a goal, but the Port Arthur team lost 4-13 in front of 3,000 spectators at the Laurier Avenue Arena in Ottawa.\nImpressed by Walker's play in the Stanley Cup challenge game the Ottawa Senators tried to land him for the 1911 12 season, but Walker declined the offer as he thought Port Arthur had a strong enough team to again compete for the Stanley Cup. For the 1911 12 season future Hockey Hall of Fame members Harry Cameron and Frank Nighbor joined the Port Arthur team from Pembroke, Ontario, but after the team defeated the Saskatoon Wholesalers 12-",

Walker had first signed a contract with the Toronto club for the 1912 13 NHA season, but jumped contract to Moncton along with Fred Doherty after only one game in the NHA for a higher salary in the Maritimes.

They had been given exemption from the war on the condition that they continued with their employment in the city, which held them out from rejoining the Metropolitans in the PCHA.

In a 1960 interview with Bill Westwick of the Ottawa Journal, Nighbor claimed he had learned his famous poke checking technique by watching Walker while the two players were teammates in Port Arthur.\nOne instance in which Walker used his hook check with great success was during the 1917 Stanley Cup Finals against the Montreal Canadiens. The Canadiens had won the first game of the best-of-five series 8 goals to 4, but in game two Walker used his hook check effectively on Didier Pitre, one of the star forwards on the Montreal team who had scored four goals in the first game, helping his team hold the Canadiens to only one goal in a 6 1 victory.

Both Joel Rochon and William  Bud  Saurel, two players from Fort William whom Walker played against in the NOHL, claimed to have originated the check. Rochon's claim was echoed by Fort William native Hockey Hall of Fame member Jack Adams who claimed Frank Nighbor must have learned his poke check after having played against Rochon and Fort William in the NOHL, something Nighbor himself denied. Harry Scott, a teammate of Walker with the 1912 13 Moncton Victorias and an opponent of him in the NOHL between 1907 1911, claimed that it was  Bud  Saurel who had taught Walker the check.\nIn an era that was known for a lot of on-ice violence Walker was known as a clean and gentlemanly player, which reflected not only in a comparatively low amount of penalty minutes but also in a comparatively low amount of serious injuries. One serious injury he did suffer happened during the 1921 22 season when he was hit over his already injured left hand in a game in Victoria on February 10 and blood-poisoning set in to the wound.

Her father was the imperial guard general Guo Yi (郭義), whose geographical origin was lost to history. Toward the end of the Changqing era of Emperor Muzong (821 824), on account of her beauty, she was selected to be a consort to Emperor Muzong's son and Crown Prince Li Zhan.

It was produced and released by Universal Pictures.\nPlot\nAs described in a review in a film magazine, Isobel Ludant (Philbin), the beautiful daughter of a talented but unsuccessful artist, is the breadwinner of the family, working in the shop of fashionable modiste. One night she is forced to act as a mannequin and gains the attention of art dealer Francis Doran (Kerry). As a result of a remark made by one of the other mannequins, Isobel attacks the young woman and is discharged. Before she reaches home, a man from the modeste's shop tells her that her father will be arrested unless she pays  150 for the dress she ruined in the fight. To save his daughter, the father (Ludant) goes with some crooks to identify a painting they want to steal, but he is caught and sent to Sing Sing. From then on, Isobel is placed in many suspicious situations as secretary to Doran, who knows nothing of what happened to the father. Doran loves her, but she believes his attentions mean less than marriage until he stands by her when her father is released from jail and his disgrace is blazoned to the world, at the time Doran's masterpiece is acclaimed by critics.\nCast\nPreservation\nA print of Fifth Avenue Models is held at the UCLA Film   Television Archive in Los Angeles.\nReferences\nBibliography\nGoble, Alan.

The class represented the penultimate stage in the development of the Southern Railway's 2-6-0  family , which improved upon the basic principles established by GWR Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) George Jackson Churchward for Great Western Railway (GWR) locomotives. The U class design drew from experience with the GWR 4300s and N classes, improved by applying Midland Railway ideas to the design, enabling the SECR to influence development of the 2-6-0 in Britain.\nThe U class was designed in the mid-1920s for production at a time when more obsolete 4-4-0 locomotives were withdrawn, and derived from Maunsell's earlier SECR K ( River ) class 2-6-4 tank locomotives. The first 20 members of the U class were rebuilds of the K class locomotives, one of which was involved in the Sevenoaks railway accident. A further 20 U class locomotives were built in 1928 to fill the gap in cross-country and semi-fast express passenger services after the withdrawal of the K class.

The design also continued the standardisation of the Southern Railway locomotive fleet by using parts designed to be interchangeable with other Maunsell-designed classes.\nA total of 50 locomotives were built over three batches between 1928 and 1931, and the design formed the basis for the 3-cylinder U1 class of 1928. They were able to operate over most of the Southern Railway network, gaining the nickname  U-boats  after the submarine warfare of the First World War, and continued to operate with British Railways (BR). The class saw continuous use until 1966, when all members of the U class were withdrawn from service. Four U class locomotives have been preserved on two heritage railways in the south of England.\nBackground\nThe history of the U class is complex as it is linked to the fate of the 2-cylinder K ( River ) class 2-6-4 tank locomotives. The design work for a new passenger 2-6-0 with 6 ft (1.83 m) driving wheels was complete by 1927, when the involvement of a K class locomotive in the Sevenoaks rail crash presented an opportunity to bring forward construction of the class.

The K class tank engines were the passenger counterpart to the N class 2-6-0 mixed-traffic design, and were noted for rough-riding over the cheaply laid track of the former SECR. The class was withdrawn from service, and the inquiry that followed determined that the rough-riding contributed to the crash. Its recommendation was that the K class should be rebuilt to 2-6-0 tender locomotives, using tried and tested features used by Maunsell and his assistant, the former GWR engineer Harold Holcroft on the N class.\nThe N class principles applied to the U class design aided mass production, and incorporated several features found on the GWR 4300 Class locomotives designed by Churchward. An order made in 1926 for a second batch of 20 K class locomotives was delayed until 1928, when the specification was revised to construct U class locomotives. It was intended to replace several elderly 4-4-0 classes within the former SECR's running fleet, and attempted to standardise and ease maintenance of locomotives by sharing parts with other Maunsell designs.

The addition of a tender increased the operating range of the U class over its K class predecessors, and the wheel arrangement applied to the former K class locomotives improved the locomotive's stability when operational.\nConstruction details\nK class rebuilds\nThe rebuilding programme that followed the derailment of K class No. A800  River Cray  at Sevenoaks began at Ashford works in June 1928. The work involved in converting a 2-6-4 tank engine to a 2-6-0 tender locomotive included the removal of the side water tanks, rear coal bunker and trailing axles, although the 6 ft (1.83 m) driving wheels, right-hand drive and N class type boiler were retained. The aesthetic aspects inherited from the K class were the former Midland Railway engineer James Clayton s contributions to the design, creating a simple, functional locomotive similar to the N class.\nThe rebuilt locomotives were given a tender and a re-designed cab that bore a strong resemblance to those featured on designs by Henry Fowler. Two designs of Maunsell tender were used, the straight-sided 3,500 imperial gallons (15,911 L) variety, and the larger 4,000-imperial-gallon (18,184 L) design used on later batches of the N class with",

The first rebuild was No. A805 River Camel, which also became the first U class locomotive into service in March 1928, three months before the first production locomotive under construction at Brighton. The rapid turnaround was achieved as design work was already in place, and the rebuilding of existing locomotives was cheaper than building from scratch.\nNo. A805 was put on performance trials prior to work commencing on rebuilding of the rest of the class at Brighton and Eastleigh works. The rebuilds lost their names because of the bad publicity attached to the  River  class after the 1927 crash, and the heavily damaged No. A800 was the last member of the K class to be rebuilt to U class configuration in December 1928. The unique 3-cylinder  River  tank, K1 class No. A890 River Frome was also rebuilt to the general U class specification, becoming the prototype of Maunsell's 3-cylinder U1 class derivative in June 1928.\nFirst production batch and differences with rebuilt locomotives\nConstruction of the delayed 1926 order for 20 K class locomotives began in 1928 after",

As a result of Harold Holcroft's position as one of Maunsell's assistants, the new-builds also displayed the Churchward GWR 4300 Class influence. The ideas applied to this class were already used on the N, N1 and K class rebuilds, including long-travel valves for fast running, Belpaire firebox and conical boilers, constructed at the North British Locomotive Works in Glasgow. The first of the production batch emerged from Brighton works in August 1928 and featured a tapered chimney and smokebox snifting valves, both of which were used on the K and N class locomotives.\nThe 20 locomotives of the first production batch were split equally between Brighton and Ashford works, and all were completed by December 1929. The production locomotives had a slightly different profile to the K class rebuilds and featured left-hand drive to improve the visibility of signals from the driver's side of the footplate. They also had higher running plates along the sides of the boiler than the rebuilds, which required smaller wheel splashers to cover the tops of the driving wheels.

Another variation was the flatter top to the dome covers, as the rebuilds retained the high N class type used on the K class.\nIn common with the N, N1 and K class locomotives, the Midland Railway influence of Clayton showed in the placement of locomotive fittings on the production batch, as the water top-feed into the boiler was located inside a dome, whilst the cab area was a modified version of those on the 0-6-0s of Henry Fowler and the K class rebuilds. The rebuilds had Midland Railway-style double spectacle plates (the small windows on the front face of the cab) left over from the K class cabs, whereas the production versions had one each side of the boiler. Such modifications were becoming typical of the Southern Railway's attempt to produce a fleet of standardised locomotives. However, all members of the U class were to vary from GWR practice, as the superheating surface area was increased, and all were equipped with outside Walschaerts valve gear.\nSecond production batch and modifications\nThe second batch of ten new-build U class locomotives was constructed between February and May 1931 when more obsolete locomotives were withdrawn from service.

The new batch also featured detail differences from the rest of the class, such as the arrangement of the footsteps at the front of the locomotive, though continued to use the standard left-hand drive cab layout to improve the driver's forward vision from the cab. Smoke deflectors were fitted to the whole class from 1933 to prevent drifting smoke from obscuring forward vision. The smokebox snifting valves applied to the class by Maunsell were removed by his successor Oliver Bulleid, who also fitted U1 class chimneys to improve the draughting.\nOperational details\nThe U class was a reliable and economical design more than capable of attaining speeds in excess of 70 mph (110 km h) as a result of being fitted with long-travel valves. They had high capacity, tapered boilers which promoted free steaming, and 6 ft (1.83 m) driving wheels which allowed fast running over long distances. They were distributed more widely than their N class counterparts, although one drawback in operating the class was the size of the cylinders and cab, which meant the U class was out of gauge for the Tonbridge-Hastings line due to inadequate clearances",

They were distributed more widely than their N class counterparts, although one drawback in operating the class was the size of the cylinders and cab, which meant the U class was out of gauge for the Tonbridge-Hastings line due to inadequate clearances in tunnels along the route. Otherwise, their  go anywhere  nature earned them the nickname of  U-boats , and crews praised their abilities to achieve what they were designed to do.\nThe Southern Railway operating department undertook trials to improve fleet efficiency. When built, Eastbourne-based No. A629 was fitted with an experimental pulverised fuel burner of German design; the experiment was terminated when a minor explosion was caused by the powdered coal coming into contact with sparks thrown from the blastpipe. The experiment also proved that pulverised coal was a false economy, as much of the fine dust was sucked through the chimney without combustion taking place. The locomotive was returned to normal coal burning in 1935. In 1947 the class became a test-bed for a government-backed scheme regarding fuelling arrangements in anticipation of a coal shortage. Two of the class, Nos. 1625 and 1797, were converted to oil burning, with more set to follow suit; but the project was abandoned and the two oil burners were reverted to coal-firing before this could take place.\nAll members of the class entered British Railways service in 1948, and from 1955 23 of the U class received chimneys of the",

A few members of the class were given replacement frames at overhaul with a shallower curve between the front buffer beam and smokebox. During the early 1960s, the withdrawal of the ageing T9 class designed by Dugald Drummond saw the U class replacing them on services west of Exeter, though their large wheels offered little advantage on the steeper gradients that characterised this part of the railway network. The favoured form of 2-6-0 motive power west of Exeter was the smaller-wheeled N class, while heavier passenger work was allocated to Bulleid's Unrebuilt Light Pacifics, which were within the weight restrictions imposed in this area. The U class represented one of the less glamorous classes of passenger locomotive due to the fact that they were used mainly on mixed-traffic and secondary passenger duties.\nWithdrawal\nThe class were withdrawn between 1962 and 1966.\nAccidents and incidents\nOn 25 May 1933, a passenger train, hauled by LSWR M7 Class 0-4-4T No. 107, was derailed at Ray",

In the final moments of the war, German Führer Adolf Hitler managed to create his Wunderwaffe a team of Nazi physicists who finished the German atomic bomb project. In January 1945, a V-2 rocket armed with a nuclear warhead fell on the Soviet army that was preparing to cross the Polish-German border. Military activities were stopped, and truce talks began. During these talks, first, the United States and then the Soviet Union developed their own nuclear weapons. The border between Germany and Poland was not ultimately set and the Armia Krajowa announced the creation of New Poland. In the aftermath of the treaties between Germany, the United States, and the Soviet Union, New Poland became a buffer zone with United States military bases spread around its territory. Thus began the global Cold War.\nThe United States invested heavily in the development of Poland, especially its military-industrial complex. Poland east of the Vistula and San  the Socialist Republic of Eastern Poland, was under Soviet influence, and Warsaw, its capital, was surrounded by the Warsaw Wall.

The Kaiser announced that if the Soviet Union would not fulfill his demands, he has 16 more of those missiles to fire. Extorted, the Soviet Union withdrew from the occupied part of Poland and Western Ukraine; Kaiser was proclaimed the Head of State and the era of totalitarian Poland began. The United States officially withdrew its army from Polish territories, but secret negotiations continued concerning further financial support and technological exchange.\nIn 2011, Germany completed the development of a new bomb. Its real power was a mystery even to the bomb's creators. One year later, a bomb code-named  Entropy  exploded over the English Channel. Whether by accident or part of an intentional action remains a mystery. As a result, all of the rockets throughout the Cold War theater locked onto their targets and were fired at the same time.

About 20 years ago, the citizens of The Republic had to search for shelter from the hell of the Third World War, yet only a few were fortunate enough to have a place waiting for them in the prepared shelters. With the passage of time, the fear of death on the surface became only an unpleasant memory; however, the seemingly safe hideout turned out to be a curse that could not be escaped. It was only a matter of time before somebody snapped, and thus the paradise of safety became a nightmare of imprisonment.\nPlot\nThe protagonist of Afterfall: InSanity is Albert Tokaj, a member of a medical team that takes care of the mental and physical well-being of citizens living in the shelter Glory. He specializes in the mental disorder called confinement syndrome caused by being locked up for too long, yet he himself is not free of its symptoms. When all hell begins to break loose, Albert has to find the answers to many questions, the where and the why, who is a real enemy, and who is a trusted friend. He will have to face the dangers lurking in the darkness of the shelter and within his own mind, battling weakness and fear.\nDevelopment\nAfterfall was originally conceived as a post-apocalyptic role-playing game in the vein of the Fallout and the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. franchises, but was later turned into a survival horror title.",

It uses Unreal Engine 3, making it compatible with both Windows and Linux. During development, the game was titled as Bourgeoisie: Pearl of the Wastelands, Rascal and Afterfall.\nMarketing and release\nThe developers partnered with CD Projekt to publish the game in Poland. The game was earlier slated for release in the first quarter of 2011, however it was delayed to the last quarter of 2011 in March 2011. In October 2011, Nicolas Games announced that the game would be available for one dollar if the game reached a total of 10 million pre-orders, with players getting the right to download the game from peer-to-peer networks such as torrent while 10  of the collected money will go to charity.

The institution plays an important role in expanding public's awareness of artworks through preservation, development and exploitation of the visual arts in Indonesia.\nHistory\nEducational complex\nThe original address of the complex was Koningsplein Oost No. 14, Batavia. The main building (Gedung A) was built in 1817 by G.C. Van Rijk as an Indische Woonhuis (Indies residence) in a Dutch Indies colonial style. The materials for the construction were taken from the remains of Kasteel Batavia.\nIn 1900, the complex was converted into an HBS educational institution known as Carpentier Alting Stichting (CAS) under the authority of the Dutch Protestant pastor and prominent Freemason Albertus Samuel Carpentier Alting (1837 1915). The former Indies residence (Gedung A) was converted into a female dormitory building, while several buildings were added to improve the facility of the school: a lyceum or primary school (1902, now Gedung B of the National Gallery); a MULO or junior high school; and a HBS or senior high school.\nAfter independence in 1945, the CAS remained operational to serve Djakarta's large remaining white settler community",

The educational institution was placed under the authority of Raden Saleh Foundation, which continued the activities of CAS and remained under the auspices of the Freemasonry.\nIn 1961, all Dutch students and teachers of CAS were expelled by the Indonesian government and the school was abolished and its premises turned into SDN 01 (State Primary School No. 1) and Sekolah Menengah Atas 7,  Senior High School 7  In 1962, the military authorities issued a Decision Letter signed by President Sukarno which banned Freemasonry in Indonesia. As a result, the Raden Saleh Foundation was disbanded, and the school was taken over by the Department of Education and Culture of the Republic of Indonesia.\nAfter the 30 September Movement in 1965, the main building was used as the headquarters of the Youth and Student Command Unit (Komando Kesatuan Pemuda dan Pelajar Indonesia or KAPPI) that held demonstrations demanding the disbanding of the Indonesian Communist Party.\nOnce the security situation improved, the building was used",

The eight days after his birth is traditionally observed 1 January. This is in keeping with the Halakha, which dictates that males should be circumcised eight days after birth by a Mohel in a Brit Milah ceremony, at which they are also given their name. The circumcision of Christ became a very common subject in Christian art from the 10th century onwards, one of numerous events in the Life of Christ to be frequently depicted by artists. It was initially seen only as a scene in larger cycles, but by the Renaissance might be treated as an individual subject for a painting, or form the main subject in an altarpiece.\nThe event is celebrated as the Feast of the Circumcision in the Eastern Orthodox Church on 1 January in whichever calendar is used, and is also celebrated on the same day by many Anglicans. It is celebrated by Roman Catholics as the Feast of the Holy Name of Jesus, in recent years on 3 January as an Optional Memorial, though it was for long celebrated on 1 January, as some other churches still do.

A number of relics claiming to be the Holy Prepuce, the foreskin of Jesus, have surfaced.\nBiblical accounts\nLuke's account of Jesus's circumcision is extremely short, particularly compared to Paul the Apostle's much fuller description of his own circumcision in the third chapter of his Epistle to the Philippians. This led theologians Friedrich Schleiermacher and David Strauss to speculate that the author of the Gospel of Luke might have assumed the circumcision to be historical fact, or might have been relating it as recalled by someone else.\nIn addition to the canonical account in the Gospel of Luke, the apocryphal Arabic Infancy Gospel contains the first reference to the survival of Christ's severed foreskin. The second chapter has the following story:  And when the time of his circumcision was come, namely, the eighth day, on which the law commanded the child to be circumcised, they circumcised him in a cave. And the old Hebrew woman took the foreskin (others say she took the navel-string), and preserved it in an alabaster-box of old oil of spikenard. And she had a son who was a druggist, to whom she said,  Take heed thou sell not this alabaster box of spikenard-ointment, although thou shouldst be offered three hundred pence",

Now this is that alabaster-box which Mary the sinner procured, and poured forth the ointment out of it upon the head and feet of our Lord Jesus Christ, and wiped it off with the hairs of her head .\nDepictions in art\nThe circumcision controversy in early Christianity was resolved in the 1st century, so that non-Jewish Christians were not obliged to be circumcised. Saint Paul, the leading proponent of this position, discouraged circumcision as a qualification for conversion to Christianity. Circumcision soon became rare in most of the Christian world, except the Coptic Church of Egypt (where circumcision was a tradition dating to pre-Christian times) and for Judeo-Christians. Perhaps for this reason, the subject of the circumcision of Christ was extremely rare in Christian art of the 1st millennium, and there appear to be no surviving examples until the very end of the period, although literary references suggest it was sometimes depicted.\nOne of the earliest depictions to survive is a miniature in an important Byzantine illuminated manuscript of 979 984, the Menologion of Basil II in the Vatican Library.

This has a scene which shows Mary and Joseph holding the baby Jesus outside a building, probably the Temple of Jerusalem, as a priest comes towards them with a small knife. This is typical of the early depictions, which avoid showing the operation itself. At the period of Jesus's birth, the actual Jewish practice was for the operation to be performed at home, usually by the father, and Joseph is shown using the knife in an enamelled plaque from the Klosterneuburg Altar (1181) by Nicolas of Verdun, where it is next to plaques showing the very rare scenes (in Christian art) of the circumcisions of Isaac and Samson. Like most later depictions these are shown taking place in a large building, probably representing the Temple, though in fact the ceremony was never performed there. Medieval pilgrims to the Holy Land were told Jesus had been circumcised in the church at Bethlehem.\nThe scene gradually became increasingly common in the art of the Western church, and increasingly rare in Orthodox art. Various themes in theological exegesis of the event influenced the treatment in art. As the first drawing of Christ's blood, it was also seen as a forerunner of, or even the first scene of, the Passion of Christ, and was one of the Seven Sorrows of Mary.",

Other interpretations developed based on it as the naming ceremony equivalent to Christian baptism, the aspect which was eventually to become most prominent in Catholic thinking. Both in this respect and in terms of finding a place in a pictorial cycle, consideration of the circumcision put it in a kind of competition with the much better established Presentation of Jesus; eventually the two scenes were to be conflated in some paintings.\nAn influential book by Leo Steinberg, The Sexuality of Christ in Renaissance Art and in Modern Oblivion (1983, 2nd edition 1996), explores the explicit depiction of Christ's penis in art, which he argues became a new focus of attention in late medieval art, initially covered only by a transparent veil in the early 14th century, and by the second half of the century completely uncovered, and often being the subject of the gaze or gestures of other figures in the scene. This emphasis is, among other things, a demonstration of Christ's humanity when it appears in depictions of the Madonna and Child and other scenes of Christ's childhood, and also a foreshadowing of Christ's Passion to come in the context of the Circumcision.\nHaving borrowed the large architectural setting in the Temple of the Presentation, later scenes",

This reflected what had by then become, and remains, standard Jewish practice, where the ceremony is performed in the synagogue and the baby is held by the seated rabbi as the mohel performs the operation. Such an arrangement is seen in a miniature from a German Pentateuch in Hebrew from about 1300, showing the Circumcision of Isaac. Other depictions show the baby held by Mary or Joseph, or both. Many show another baby in the background, presumably the next in the queue.\nOther late medieval and Renaissance depictions of circumcision in general show antipathy towards Judaism; caricatures show the procedure as being grotesquely cruel and the mohel as a threatening figure; Martin Luther's anti-Judaic treatise of 1543, On the Jews and Their Lies, devotes many pages to circumcision.

Some late-medieval German depictions depict the Circumcision of Christ in a similar vein, with the baby not held by his parents and the officiating Jewish officials given stereotypic features. In at least one manuscript miniature women are shown performing the rite, which has been interpreted as a misogynistic trope, with circumcision represented as a form of emasculation.\nBy the 15th century the scene was often prominent in large polyptych altarpieces with many scenes in Northern Europe, and began to be the main scene on the central panel in some cases, usually when commissioned by lay confraternities dedicated to the Holy Name of Jesus, which were found in many cities. These often included donor portraits of members, though none are obvious in Luca Signorelli's Circumcision of Christ commissioned by the confraternity at Volterra. The devotion to the Holy Name was a strong feature of the theatrical and extremely popular preaching of Saint Bernardino of Siena, who adopted Christ's IHS monogram as his personal emblem, which was also used by the Jesuits; this often appears in paintings, as may a scroll held by an angel reading Vocatum est nomen eius Jesum.\nA smaller composition in a horizontal format originated with the Venetian painter Giovanni Bellini in about 1500 and was extremely popular, with",

These appear to have been commissioned for homes, possibly as votive offerings for the safe birth of an eldest son, although the reason for their popularity remains unclear. They followed some other depictions in showing Simeon, the prophet of the Presentation, regarded by then as a High Priest of the Temple, performing the operation on Jesus held by Mary. In other depictions he is a figure in the background, sometimes holding up his hands and looking to heaven, as in the Signorelli. An altarpiece of 1500 by another Venetian painter, Marco Marziale (National Gallery, London), is a thoroughgoing conflation of the Circumcision and Presentation, with the text of Simeon's prophecy, the Nunc dimittis, shown as if in mosaic on the vaults of the temple setting.

It appears on baptismal fonts because of the connection made by theologians with baptism. A painting (1661, National Gallery of Art, Washington) and an etching (1654) by Rembrandt are both unusual in showing the ceremony taking place in a stable. By this period large depictions were rarer in Catholic art, not least because the interpretation of the decrees of the final session of the Council of Trent in 1563 discouraged nudity in religious art, even that of the infant Jesus, which made depicting the scene difficult. Even before this, 16th-century depictions like those of Bellini, Dürer and Signorelli tended to discreetly hide Jesus's penis from view, in contrast to earlier compositions, where this evidence of his humanity is clearly displayed.\nPoems on the subject included John Milton's Upon the Circumcision and his contemporary Richard Crashaw's Our Lord in His Circumcision to His Father, which both expounded the traditional symbolism.\nTheological beliefs and celebrations\nThe circumcision of Jesus has traditionally been seen, as explained in the popular 14th-century work the Golden Legend, as the first time the blood of",

Medieval and Renaissance theologians repeatedly stressed this, also drawing attention to the suffering of Jesus as a demonstration of his humanity and a foreshadowing of his Passion. These themes were continued by Protestant theologians like Jeremy Taylor, who in a treatise of 1657 argued that Jesus's circumcision proved his human nature while fulfilling the law of Moses. Taylor also notes that had Jesus been uncircumcised, it would have made Jews substantially less receptive to his Evangelism. However, the Ethiopian Orthodox church has traditionally held that Jesus was divinely circumcised and prophesied that his blood would not be shed until he was crucified. \nThe  Feast of the Circumcision of our Lord  is a Christian celebration of the circumcision, eight days (according to the Semitic and southern European calculation of intervals of days) after his birth, the occasion on which the child was formally given his name, Jesus, a name derived from Hebrew meaning  salvation  or  saviour .

It also appears in the pre-1960 General Roman Calendar and is celebrated by churches of the Anglican Communion (though in many revised Anglican calendars, such as the 1979 calendar of the Episcopal Church, there is a tendency toward associating the day more with the Holy Name of Jesus) and virtually all Lutheran churches. Johann Sebastian Bach wrote several cantatas for this Feast,  Beschneidung des Herrn  ( Circumcision of the Lord ), including Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied, BWV 190, for 1 January 1724 in Leipzig.\nIt finds no place in the present Roman Calendar of the new form of the Roman Rite, replaced on 1 January by the Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God, but is still celebrated by Old Catholics and also by traditionalist Catholics who worship according to the classical Roman Rite (that follows the General Roman Calendar promulgated in 1962).

A number of churches in Europe have claimed to possess Jesus' foreskin, sometimes at the same time. The best known was in the Lateran Basilica in Rome, whose authenticity was confirmed by a vision of Saint Bridget of Sweden. In its gold reliquary, it was looted in the Sack of Rome in 1527, but eventually recovered.\nMost of the Holy Prepuces were lost or destroyed during the Reformation and the French Revolution. The Prepuce of Calcata is noteworthy, as the reliquary containing the Holy Foreskin was paraded through the streets of this Italian village as recently as 1983 on the Feast of the Circumcision, which was formerly marked by the Roman Catholic Church around the world on January 1 each year, and is now renamed as the Feast of the Holy Name of Jesus.

The production was delayed, and the layout stage was done at Rough Draft Korea in Seoul as a cost-saving measure. Vincent Waller was in Seoul supervising the layout stage for  The Great Outdoors  when series creator John Kricfalusi was fired from the series' production on September 21, 1992, being notified late by a horrified Gregg Vanzo.

Ken Bruce of Games Animation was sent out to finish what Waller had left behind. Billy West voices Ren in this episode as voice acting had not been done before Kricfalusi's firing. Peter Avanzino serves as a storyboard artist for the episode.\nReception\nAmerican journalist Thad Komorowski gave the episode three-and-a-half out of five stars; he wrote that the episode was merely a string of crude gags, not helped by the fact that Old Man Hunger was associated with  In the Hall of the Mountain King , signaling pederasty, worsening the already unpleasant tone of the episode.\nBooks\nDobbs, G.

Garfield, the 20th President of the United States. The school is located at 400 23rd Avenue between E. Alder and E. Jefferson Streets in the Central District section of Seattle.\nGarfield is a high school designated to serve students identified by the district as academically highly gifted, so the school offers many college-level classes, ranging from calculus-based physics to Advanced Placement (AP) studio art.\nHistory\n20th century\nJames A. Garfield High School was founded in 1920 as East High School at its current location. The first graduating class consisted of 282 students who transferred from Broadway High School. In three years, the school's enrollment forced the 12-room building to be scrapped for the Jacobean-style building designed by Floyd Naramore. In 1929, the city commissioned the architect to design an addition for the school as enrollment peaked at 2,300 students.\nGarfield High School has long played a key role in its neighborhood, the Central District. As the Central District has changed, so has the school's population. In its early decades, the school was noted for its Jewish, Japanese and Italian populations. After World War II, the neighborhood became predominantly African-American and by 1961, 51 percent of Garfield students were black, compared to only 5.",

After World War II, the neighborhood became predominantly African-American and by 1961, 51 percent of Garfield students were black, compared to only 5.3 percent of the general Seattle school district population.\nIn the late 1960s and 1970s, Garfield was at the center of the school district's attempts to avoid desegregation busing through various plans, including turning it into a  magnet school . This began the focus on music and science that persist to the present day. The school introduced an APP Program in 1979, and due to the success of this program, an alternative program, IBx, was opened for APP students at Ingraham International High School in North Seattle to help relieve pressure on an overcrowded Garfield.\nMartin Luther King Jr., Jesse Jackson, and Stokely Carmichael are among notable people who have spoken at the school.\n21st century\nThe buildings have lasted for more than eight decades, but they were partially demolished in a sweeping redesign of the school that began in June 2006. The remodel was mostly completed by the fall of 2008, making the class of 2009 the only class to attend classes in both the old and new buildings. There was a movement to hold off the remodeling to preserve the building's history, including a city initiative to preserve the Quincy Jones auditorium as a historic site, thereby",

Among the many terracotta details worked into the building are emblems of botany, the trades, arts and crafts, industry, intelligence, and the sciences.\nIncidents\nIn 2012, during a school field trip, one of the school's students allegedly raped another student.

Over time, the school has faced criticism that its AP and honors programs excluded students of color, leading to the 2017 implementation of  Honors for All,  in which all students are placed in honors level language arts and social studies courses. During the 2006 2007 school year Garfield offered more than 120 different classes across nine departments, including an extensive selection of advanced classes. Garfield students can take classes from local colleges through a program called Running Start. Some students attend on-campus courses at the University of Washington.\nTesting controversy\nIn January 2013, the entire teaching body of Garfield High School refused to administer the standardized Measures of Academic Progress, or MAP, which is administered system-wide, three times per year. The teachers called the tests useless and a waste of instructional time. After their protest became public, teachers at local schools nearby such as Ballard High School and Chief Sealth International High School joined the movement.

One of the main draws of Garfield's drama program is its large student-led Drama Club, an important element that is missing from many other local area schools. The Garfield Drama Club produces collections of short one-act plays, all of which are directed and produced by current students. The department also performs three teacher-directed shows per year: an Autumn Play, a Children's Show for local elementary schools, and a Spring Musical. A notable element of Garfield's drama program is that student leadership is present in all areas of theater. Student stage managers often help the director lead the production, while students run the costuming, hair and makeup, lighting, sound and set design programs. Musical direction is run by Garfield's choir teacher, who is sometimes assisted by a student assistant musical director.\nNewspaper\nThe Messenger is Garfield's monthly student-run newspaper.

The flood heavily damaged the facilities of Bethlehem Steel, which was Johnstown's major employer at the time, with 12,000 employees during pre-flood 1977.

Pfuhl announced his retirement in February 1993, when he announced that he would not seek re-election in the November 1993 mayoral election. In his announcement, Pfuhl told the audience,  I love my family, I love my city, I love this job. And I really feel I've been pretty good at it.

    "text": "Barbarians (German: Barbaren) is a 2020 German historical war drama television series created by Andreas Heckmann, Arne Nolting, and Jan Martin Scharf. It stars Laurence Rupp, Jeanne Goursaud, and David Schütter. The series is a fictionalized account of events during the Roman Empire's occupation of Germania, and the subsequent rebellion of some Germanic tribes led by Arminius. The series was renewed for season 2 on 10 November 2020. It was released on Netflix on 21 October 2022.\nPlot\nThe story takes place during the Roman occupation of Germania Magna (an area between the Rhine river and the Elbe) in the latter part of 9 AD. The Romans had occupied the region for twenty years, and the Germanic tribes are oppressed by the empire's heavy taxes and demands for tribute. Attempts to form a unified Germanic resistance are hampered by petty in-fighting between the tribal chieftains, and the selfish aspirations of certain tribesmen desiring peace with Rome.\nArminius, an eques in the Roman Imperial army, is a member of the Germanic Cherusci tribe who was given away as a hostage to Rome when he was a child, along with his younger brother Flavus, by his father Segimer to ensure peace between his tribe and Rome. He returns to Germania to help Publius Quinctilius Var",

Despite some weaknesses, the series is exciting and worth seeing if you don't make too many demands on the historical accuracy of the plot. \nFor Forbes, film historian Sheena Scott rated Barbarians as  an excellent series that reveals a key historical event in Europe through a gripping tale of love, friendship, betrayal and revenge  and praised the  excellent production design, great performances, especially the main trio Jeanne Goursaud, David Schütter and Laurence Rupp, and the wonderful cinematography of the series. \nJournalist Andreas Fischer of the Weser-Kurier remarked that the  biggest dilemma was the supposed historicity of the series.

He called for a clear distinction between cinema  in the imagination , fiction and what can be really considered scientifically proven today. The general idea of the  Varus battle    with ambushes, entrenchments or a contiguous battlefield   must be questioned again and again. Due to the constantly new archaeological findings from the Fund region of Kalkriese, a presumed scene of the events, this picture will be continuously changed, enriched and refined.

Moving from Corsica to Paris as a child, he later studied under Professeur Guillot de Raffaillac.

He also had a solo exhibition at the Stone Gallery (Newcastle) in 1961. In addition to painting, he also worked for several years for the framemakers and carvers, Robert Savage Ltd., where a number of well-known artists had also worked. After Savage closed his business in 1971 François Lanzi moved to Chiddingfold in Surrey until his death. Although he had lived in England many years (thirty-four in total at his death), his command of the English language was always very limited and he became somewhat withdrawn from the society around him. During his period in Chiddingfold, François Lanzi was re-discovered by the critic and gallery owner, Michael Budd. His paintings were exhibited in The Gallery (Knaphill) for a number of years.

Perhaps simply they could be termed under four headings. The vast majority of his work is abstract, pure imagination, original and spontaneous.\nUpon superficial analysis the main themes, which repeat themselves throughout his work, could be described as,\n  Christ-like forms,\n  Stained glass creations,\n  Formed and deformed Human Horse-like heads,\n  Landscape collages.\nHe uses so many different media but his goal seems to be the unending search to express his deepest, almost agonising feelings: not really concerned if he uses collage, watercolour, enamel, oil, canvas, board, card or other media. He could be closely compared to contemporary artists such as André Lanskoy and Kurt Schwitters among others of that period. He does not digress form his main themes of artistic work and his paintings are easily recognisable as Lanzi. His seclusion in Chiddingfold allowed him to follow his own artistic path, often working late into the night in his fairly dimly lit studio.

In former times, outcasts who had been excluded from Icelandic society because of crimes they had committed lived in the Ódáðahraun and accessed the oasis. One such outlaw was Fjalla-Eyvindur, who lived there during the winter of 1774 1775.\nIn 2019, Herðubreið became a part of Vatnajökull National Park.\nGeology\nHerðubreið is a basaltic central subglacial volcano that formed during the last ice age under ice at least as thick as its current prominence of about 800 m (2,600 ft). It is usually described as a composite volcano which is the same as a stratovolcano. It is separate from the present potentially active fissure swarms and central volcanoes nearby and is believed to be inactive. Its original magma reservoirs are believed to have been at 9 11 km (5.6 6.8 mi), and 15 18 km (9.3 11.2 mi) below the surface. There is in the upper crust, between 2 and 8 km (1.2 and 5.0 mi",

There is in the upper crust, between 2 and 8 km (1.2 and 5.0 mi) deep, a 10 km (6.2 mi) broad belt of shallow seismicity extending from 30 km (19 mi) to the south of Herðubreið to the mountain itself due to plate boundary spreading. There is also deeper activity likely to be related to magmatic movements but perhaps this is related to the shallow volcano-tectonic seismic activity at the active Askja volcano nearby. Herðubreið is a classic tuya and was quickly recognised as such after the landform was described firstly as a subglacial volcanic construct in 1947.\nThe eruption sequence likely started before the glaciation of the last ice age south of Herðubreið in the ridge area called Herdubreidartögl with olivine tholeiite basalt being erupted. Glaciation resulted in pressure on the magma reservoir that initially may have switched off further eruptive activity. In due course a second stage in the southern part of Herðubreið melted the ice with initial olivine tholeiite lava deposition under a lake that was followed by underwater hyaloclastite mass flow deposits.

This stage was not as confined by ice as the next stage and has evidence of a subaerial lava sheet, and had only moderately steep ice walls below this. As the ice sheet thickened further towards the glacial maximum of 12 15,000 years ago hyaloclastite, then pillow lavas under steep-sided hyaloclastite occurred. These built up until Herðubreið emerged above the lake surface, from a lake with almost vertical confining ice walls many about 800 m (2,600 ft) tall. If as happened in Herðubreið's case the eruption in its last stage became again sub-aerial with a lava cap and a spatter cone or crater vent. \nAccordingly the southern portion of the plateau at the top of Herðubreiðar has a deep crater, which can contain a lake in summer. While by the end of glaciation, Herðubreiðar was extinct, volcanic activity resumed for a time at Herdubreidartögl to its south with fallout deposits and olivine tholeiitic lava flows in a much more spread out fashion.\nSee also\nGeography of Iceland\nVolcanism of Iceland\nList of volcanic eruptions in Iceland\nList of volcanoes in Iceland\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial Website of Vatnajökull National Park\n Herdubreid .

Following the Second World War, additional names were inscribed to honour those who died in that war.\nDesign\nThe memorial is in the form of a tall stone Celtic cross on a tapering shaft and square plinth. Fixed to the base are bronze plaques that record the names of the fallen from both World Wars. The inscription  THEIR NAME LIVETH FOR EVERMORE  is engraved on the memorial.\nBlomfield s design is consistent with his broader work on war memorials, which were often characterised by classical or cross forms, and a focus on dignity and permanence.\nThe Celtic cross was a widely adopted form in British war memorials of the period, symbolising sacrifice and commemoration.\nUse and commemoration\nThe memorial is used as a focal point for annual Remembrance Sunday services. Wreaths are laid and a two-minute silence is observed as part of the national act of remembrance.\nListing\nIn 2018, the memorial was designated as a Grade II listed building by Historic England. The listing describes the structure as  an eloquent witness to the tragic impact of world events on the local community,  and notes its architectural interest as the work of a prominent memorial designer.\nSee also\nMenin Gate\nCommonwealth War Graves Commission\nRemembrance Sunday\nReferences\nExternal links\nhttp:  www.geograph.org.uk snippet 8592\nhttp:  www.hertsatwar.co.uk potters_bar\nhttp:  www.hertsburialsandmemorials.org.uk search.html\nhttps:  www.warmemorialsonline.org.uk node 121592",

    "text": ", in southwestern British Columbia, Canada. It is part of the Joffre Group, which is a subset of the Lillooet Ranges. It is situated 25 km (16 mi) east of Pemberton, midway between Mount Matier and Slalok Mountain, both one kilometre either side of Spetch. The mountain's name was submitted by Karl Ricker of the Alpine Club of Canada to honor Samuel W. Spetch, who operated the general store at Birken, and other businesses in Pemberton. The name was officially adopted on January 23, 1979, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1971 by J. Oswald and G. Walter. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into Joffre Creek and Twin One Creek, both tributaries of the Lillooet River. The mountain and its climate supports the Matier Glacier on the northern slope.\nClimate\nBased on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Spetch is located in a subarctic climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below  20  C with wind chill factors below  30  C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Mount Spetch.\nClimbing Routes\nEstablished climbing routes on Mount Spetch:\nEast Side - class 3 summer ascent with glacier travel\nNorthwest Face - winter ascent via steep snow\nReferences\nGallery\nSee also\nGeography of British Columbia\nGeology of British Columbia\nExternal links\nWeather: Mountain Forecast\nSam Spetch photo: Pemberton Museum",

She wrote more than two dozen books on her travels in the Middle East and Afghanistan as well as several autobiographical works and essays. She was one of the first non-Arabs known to travel through the southern Arabian Desert in modern times.\nEarly life and studies\nStark was born on 31 January 1893 in Paris, where her parents were studying art. Her mother, Flora, was of English, French, German, and Polish descent. Her father, Robert, was an English painter from Devon. Stark spent much of her childhood in northern Italy, helped by the fact that Pen Browning, a friend of her father, had bought three houses in Asolo. Her maternal grandmother lived in Genoa.\nHer parents' marriage was unhappy, and they separated early in Stark's childhood. Stark's biographer, Jane Fletcher Geniesse quoting Stark's cousin, Nora Stanton Barney claimed that Stark's biological father was Obediah Dyer,  a well-to-do young man from a prominent family in New Orleans . No other corroboration of this account is known; Stark made no reference to it in her autobiography.\nFor her ninth birthday, Stark received a copy of One Thousand and One Nights and became fascinated with the Orient.

She was often ill while young and confined to the house, so she found an outlet in reading. She delighted in reading French, in particular Alexandre Dumas. When she was thirteen, in an accident in a factory in Italy, her hair was caught in a machine, tearing her scalp and ripping her right ear off. She spent four months in hospital receiving skin grafts, leaving her face disfigured. She usually wore hats or bonnets, often flamboyant ones, to cover her scars.\nAt the age of 30, Stark enrolled at Bedford College, London to study Arabic and later, Persian. She subsequently attended the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS).\nEarly travels and writings\nDuring World War I, Stark worked as a postal censor, trained as a VAD and served initially with G. M. Trevelyan's British Red Cross ambulance unit, based at the Villa Trento near Udine. Her mother had remained in Italy and taken a share in a business; her sister Vera married the co-owner. In 1926, Vera died after a miscarriage. In her writings, Stark explained that Vera was not able to live life on her own terms, and she would not do the same. Shortly afterward, she began her travels.\nIn November 1927, she visited Asolo for the first",

Shortly afterward, she began her travels.\nIn November 1927, she visited Asolo for the first time in years. Later that month she boarded a ship for Beirut, where her travels in the East began. She stayed first at the home of James Elroy Flecker in Lebanon, then in Baghdad, Iraq (then a British protectorate), where she met the British high commissioner. During that trip, she secretly travelled by donkey with a Druze guide and an English woman. She kept the journey secret as Syria and Lebanon were under French control as the Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon. This was a repressive government system that did not allow travel within the region. The group travelled by night and took remote, countryside routes. However, French Army officers still caught them, thought the women to be spies, but released them three days later. After her trip, Stark wrote about the repressive French regime and the abuse inflicted on the Syrian people in an English magazine.\nBy 1931, she had completed three dangerous treks into the wilderness of western Iran, parts where Westerners were unknown, and had located the long-fabled Valleys of the Assassins (Hashshashins).

She hoped to trace the frankincense route of the Hadhramaut, the hinterland of southern Arabia. Only a handful of Western explorers had ventured into the region but never so far or so widely as she. Her goal was to reach the ancient city of Shabwa, which was rumoured to have been the capital of the Queen of Sheba. She fell seriously ill on the trip. After contracting measles from a child in a harem, as well as dysentery, she had to be airlifted to a British hospital in Aden. Although she never reached Shabwa, she was able to travel extensively and recount many experiences. Stark returned to the region later for additional trips. During these journeys, she encountered slavery in Yemen, which caused a  moral predicament , according to a New Yorker profile. Stark reasoned that slavery seemed to decline in less religious societies, and thus she felt that slavery would decline in Arabia as it evolved.

For her travels and accounts, she received the Founder's Medal of the Royal Geographical Society.\nWorld War II\nIn the autumn of 1939 Stark offered her services to the British Ministry of Information. Her prior experience in the Middle East was sufficient for the Ministry to send her to Yemen to spread propaganda on the British cause. Part of her duties involved showing films, despite the rulers of Yemen being strict Muslims who disapproved of any images of humans and wildlife. After working for two months in Yemen and Aden, she was sent to Cairo, a posting that doubled her salary to  1,200. Following her arrival in June 1940, she set up an intimate salon where, over tea four times a week, she advocated for the British cause. Before long, Christopher Scaife who was teaching English at the King Fuad I University was sending her the odd Egyptian student who wanted to know what the British were fighting for. Stark encouraged them to bring their friends and the discussions expanded to cover not only the war but also its effects on Egypt.

These discussions grew to become the basis of the Ikhwan al Hurriya (Brotherhood of Freedom) propaganda network that was aimed at persuading Arabs to support the Allies or at least remain neutral.\nBy the middle of the war, the brotherhood claimed to have tens of thousands of members. The work involved Stark travelling all over Egypt and often speaking for as many as 10 hours a day. These wartime experiences were described in her Letters from Syria (1942) and East is West (1945). Following a visit to Iraq during which she was besieged in the British Embassy during an attempted coup d'état in April 1941, Stark was asked by British Ambassador Sir Kinahan Cornwallis to set up a branch of the Ikhwan al Hurriya in that country. Stark agreed and spent the next two years in Iraq dispensing British propaganda.\nIn February 1943, she visited Archibald Wavell and his wife in India. To assist her with the return journey, Wavell arranged for her to have a car.

She gave speeches calling for quotas on Jewish migration to Palestine, which angered the global Jewish community. However, Stark felt that she was not at all anti-Jewish; she simply felt that Arab consent should be considered before mass migration took place. These speeches are thought to be her most controversial work during WWII. In 1943, she wrote  I really can t see that there is any kind of way of dealing with the Zionist question except by a massacre now and then... What can we do? It is the ruthless last penny that they squeeze out of you that does it... the world has chosen to massacre them at intervals, and whose fault is it? \nPost-war travel and writings\nFollowing her marriage in 1947, she published a volume of miscellaneous essays, Perseus in the Wind (1948) and three volumes of autobiography, Traveller's Prelude (1950), Beyond Euphrates.

It was one of eight Service Flying Training Schools established by the RAAF to provide intermediate and advanced flying instruction to new pilots as part of Australia's contribution to the Empire Air Training Scheme. No. 5 SFTS was formed at RAAF Station Uranquinty, New South Wales, in October 1941, and disbanded in February 1946.

Care and Maintenance Unit Uranquinty was also formed from No. 5 SFTS's facilities, to look after surplus aircraft at the base prior to their disposal, and disbanded in December 1948.\nHistory\nRAAF aircrew training expanded dramatically following the outbreak of World War II, in response to Australia's participation in the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS). The Air Force's pre-war flight training facility, No. 1 Flying Training School at RAAF Station Point Cook, Victoria, was supplanted in 1940 41 by twelve Elementary Flying Training Schools (EFTS), eight Service Flying Training Schools (SFTS), and the Central Flying School (CFS).

While CFS turned out new flight instructors, the EFTS provided basic training to prospective pilots who, if successful, would go on to an SFTS for further instruction that focussed on operational (or  service ) flying techniques.\nThe course at SFTS typically consisted of two streams, intermediate and advanced, and included such techniques as instrument flying, night flying, advanced aerobatics, formation flying, dive bombing, and aerial gunnery. The total duration of training varied during the war as demand for aircrew fluctuated. Initially running for 16 weeks, the course was cut to 10 weeks (which included 75 hours flying time) in October 1940. A year later it was raised to 12 weeks (including 100 hours flying time), and again to 16 weeks two months later. It continued to increase after this, peaking at 28 weeks in June 1944.\nNo. 5 Service Flying Training School (No. 5 SFTS) was formed at RAAF Station Uranquinty, New South Wales, in October 1941, and came under the control of No. 2 Training Group.

Along with No. 2 Service Flying Training School at nearby RAAF Station Forest Hill, and the later No. 1 Basic Flying Training School at Uranquinty, No. 5 SFTS was one of the so-called  Wagga Flying Training Schools , which together graduated over 3,000 pilots in the 1940s and '50s. The unit's inaugural commanding officer was Group Captain Ulex Ewart, a graduate of the Royal Military College, Duntroon, who had been seconded to the Air Force and learnt to fly on the first cadet course at No. 1 Flying Training School in 1923. At the time of its formation, No. 5 SFTS had a strength of 792 personnel, responsible for training about 200 pilots. One of its original instructors was Flying Officer Bill Newton, who was later awarded the Victoria Cross for bombing raids in New Guinea. Following the outbreak of the Pacific War in December 1941, the school's CAC Wirraway single-engined trainers were classified as Second Line (Reserve) aircraft in the defence of Australia.\nNo. 5 SFTS began flight training in February 1942 using 28 Wirraways.

The unit grew over the next two years, and by early 1944 was operating 128 Wirraways, two de Havilland DH.84 Dragons, two de Havilland Moth Minors and a CAC Wackett. It typically graduated one course of pilots each month, although the wastage rate sometimes exceeded 40 per cent. Among its graduates was Len Waters, the first Aboriginal Australian military aviator, and the only one to serve as a fighter pilot in the RAAF during World War II. As a training facility, No. 5 SFTS regularly suffered flying accidents. Forty-two of its students died during the war, an average of around one per month. A near miss involving more experienced pilots occurred at the school in December 1943, when aces Clive Caldwell and John Waddy, then instructors at No. 2 Operational Training Unit in Mildura, almost collided when they crossed paths during an aerobatics display over the base.\nNo. 5 SFTS reached a strength of some 2,000 personnel during the war, and graduated 1,515 pilots.

An additional panel to the memorial was unveiled in September 2002 by the Governor-General of Australia, Peter Hollingworth; the proceedings included an aerial display by a Pilatus PC-9 of the Roulettes aerobatic team, and the arrival of a Wirraway from Temora Aviation Museum, the first time in 45 years that one of these trainers had landed at Uranquinty.\nNotes\nReferences\nAlexander, Kristen (2006).

    "text": "The Anti-Federalist League (AFL) was a small cross-party organisation in the United Kingdom, formed in 1991 to campaign against the Maastricht Treaty. It is mainly remembered now as the forerunner of the UK Independence Party.\nThe main founder of the Anti-Federalist League was Alan Sked, lecturer at the London School of Economics, leading figure in the Bruges Group, and former official of the Liberal Party. The Maastricht Treaty, which greatly increased the powers of the European Commission, was widely unpopular, according to opinion polls, but all three of the main parties had pledged to support its ratification in the House of Commons. Sked and others felt that this denied voters a say on a crucial constitutional issue. Running AFL candidates was supposed to make good this shortfall in the democratic process. Another founder was Helen Szamuely. Members of the League included future UKIP leaders Nigel Farage (who was previously a member of the Conservative Party, like many of the other early UKIP AFL members) and Gerard Batten.\nThe League stood seventeen candidates in the 1992 general election, but failed to make any impact or attract any press attention. It lost all its deposits. The following year, Alan Sked represented it in by-elections in Newbury (gaining 1  of the vote) and Christchurch (1.6 ).\nAmidst extraordinary scenes in the House of Commons, and in the teeth of intense opposition from a",

Many members of the Anti-Federalist League concluded that with the Treaty in place, the only option for anti-federalists was to campaign for complete British withdrawal from the European Union. To this end, Sked and others met in late 1993 to set up a full-blown political party: the UK Independence Party. Not all members of the League followed Sked into the new organisation, but the party did effectively supersede the League, which ceased to exist.\nElection results\nThe League contested seventeen constituencies at the 1992 general election and Sked contested two by-elections in 1993.\n1992 United Kingdom general election\nThe 1992 general election was held on Thursday 9 April 1992.\nSource:\n1993 by-elections\nSee also\n   References",

It provides a link between Swansea city center and the West Wales Line to the South Wales Main Line. The valley crossing provides a panoramic view of Landore, Kilvey Hill, the Liberty Stadium and the Swansea Enterprise Park.\nThe Landore viaduct was constructed as a key element of the West Wales Line during the late 1840s. The structure, which has a length of 536-metre (1,759 ft), was originally designed by the famed engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, and incorporated a diverse range of structural design elements and was primarily constructed out of timber. It was officially opened to traffic in 1850. The structure was first updated in 1889, using wrought-iron for the central span. Between 1978 and 1979, the majority of the viaduct was re-decked using steel beams. The structure remains in use to the current day.\nHistory\nBackground and design\nDuring the mid-1840s, work commenced upon the construction of the South Wales Railway, which was being pursued with the goal of connecting Gloucester and the Great Western Railway to key sites throughout South Wales, especially the envisioned ferry traffic at Fishguard, Pembrokeshire.

Headed by the noted civil engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, the line initially opened during 1850 through to the city of Swansea, although construction activity continued on other sections for decades more. The arrival of the railway had the effect of eclipsed the Swansea Canal as the major transport artery in the region.\nTo connect what is now commonly known as the South Wales Main Line with both the Swansea city center and the West Wales Line, it was necessary to construct a crossing of the River Tawe. Following the surveying of the local landscape, it was decided that the optimum site was located around 4.8 kilometres (3.0 mi) north of the river mouth in Swansea Bay. The selected means of crossing the river valley was a viaduct, which was designed by Brunel himself. Its design incorporated two sizable approaches; the western approach, which was curved at a radius of 402.3 metres (1,320 ft), possessed a gradient of 1 in 264, while the straight eastern approach has a gradient of 1 in 109.\nThe viaduct possessed a length of 536.4 metres (1,760 ft), comprising 37 arches in total. The span of these arches varied significantly in places; largest of which being 33.5 metres (110 ft) to cross over the River Tawe itself. The",

The rest of the piers consisted of timber trestles that were arranged from 406 mm (16.0 in) square uprights, complete with two, three or four legs founded on either timber piles or masonry pads; the difference in the number of legs used being dependent upon the specific ground conditions for each pier.\nConstruction\nThe responsibility for overseeing the viaduct's construction was assigned to Lavington Evans Fletcher, who was one of Brunel's assistants.

The resident engineer was Robert Brodie and the assistant resident engineer was one Samuel Jones; George Hennet was appointed as the contractor for its construction. The steelwork for the structure was produced by Chepstow-based manufacturer Edward D. Finch   Co., and the wrought iron elements were made locally by Palmer of Neath.\nPrior to the commencement of construction, a relatively expensive land acquisition phase had to be conducted; there were a large number of buildings that fell directly in the path of the viaduct. Further difficulties were presented by the ground itself; due to the presence of earlier mining activities, the soil's stability had been negatively affected in some areas. On the eastern bank of the river, the ground was effectively marshland, being historically prone to flooding from the Tawe during the spring. Thus, the design of both the foundations and the piers of the viaduct were designed to achieve the necessary stability in spite of these unfavourable footings.\nDuring October 1847, pile driving for the viaduct's foundations had commenced. By May 1848, work on the masonry of the west abutment was recorded as having been completed. On 30 May 1850, the locomotive Hercules and its tender became the first train to cross over the completed viaduct. On 18 June 1850, the structure was officially opened to traffic,",

On 18 June 1850, the structure was officially opened to traffic, being used by the first train between Chepstow and Swansea during the same day. Reportedly, the Landore Viaduct had cost roughly  28,720 to construct.\nRebuilding and maintenance\nBetween September 1886 and October 1889, the viaduct was subject to its first modification programme. Dependent upon opinion, this programme could be viewed as an effective replacement of the original structure. During this work, the superstructure was reconfigured to a 22-span configuration, which was supported on additional masonry piers. A reduction in the viaduct's length was achieved via the deliberate embanking of the eastern approach using slag from the nearby Hafod Copperworks. A single steel truss was used to replace the original river span, while the remainder were rebuilt using wrought iron. According to an account in the Western Mail published on 5 October 1889, the cost of these alterations came to  30,000.\nBetween 1978 and 1979, the nationalised railway operator British Rail undertook another series of modifications, including the replacement of the wrought iron deck girders with new steel beams. As a result of multiple alterations to the structure, all that survives of Brunel's viaduct are the five original masonry piers located to the west of the Tawe. In addition, several stumps of the timber piers can be found the river bed while some sections of hidden timberwork remain but had been entombed by the 19th century extension of the viaduct's eastern embankment.\nReferences\nExternal links\nThe Landore Viaduct, Swansea - BBC News\nLandore Viaduct Looking North: 1960 - Swansea Canal Society Archived 15 May 2019 at the Wayback Machine",

The embassy was on a main road and attracted much publicity until it was closed down two years later.\nHe is the father of former Australian Democrats Senator Natasha Stott Despoja.\nPersonal life\nDespoja arrived in Australia in 1959 without any English. He regarded himself as a political refugee. Four years later, he won the grand prize on a television quiz program, Coles  3000 Question, broadcast around Australia. His special category was Australian history, and he was able to name the five convicts transported to Australia in 1794 now known as the Scottish Martyrs. Despoja said that  their case stuck in (his) mind  because they were political exiles like him.\nAt the time of his big win, Despoja was working as a press operator at the Chrysler Australia factory in Adelaide. He was earning  12 a week. The prize money enabled him to buy a block of land on which he built a house and to attend university to obtain a bachelor's degree with an honours thesis on Yugoslav history.

In the same statement, he promised legislation to give the force of Australian law to the nation's obligations under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. The response of the Croatian community in Australia was a decision to seek official recognition for the  embassy .\nThe Parliament passed a Diplomatic and Consular Missions Act in August 1978. This was a law  to prevent the improper use of diplomatic and consular signs and titles . Still, the Government did not move against the Croatian Embassy for another nine months. On 6 June 1979, two Commonwealth policemen delivered a letter from the Attorney-General, Peter Durack, warning that the Government would begin legal action in two weeks unless Mario Despoja provided certain undertakings.

Despoja's considered response was to hold teleconferences around Australia with other Croatian community leaders over the following weekend before taking the matter to the  Embassy's  lawyers.\nThe Commonwealth's arguments before the Federal Court of Australia succeeded on 7 August 1979, when Mr Justice Reginald Smithers granted an injunction against Despoja. The injunction forbade Despoja from displaying any signs, insignia or flags giving the impression of an embassy and from publicising the  Embassy  as representing a part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

The parish is the largest in the Archdiocese of Białystok and contains about 15,000 people. Next to the church there is a monument dedicated to Solidarity movement and on the outer church wall there is the inscription '1981' to mark the year Solidarity movement was established.\nHistory\nFollowing the massive development of blocks and panel construction in Dziesięciny I and Dziesięciny II districts, there was a growing demand for the construction of a church in the area. The place where the church stands today was used for gatherings of Solidarity members who also prayed and agitated for the church construction. On June 21, 1981, the banner of the Białystok Solidarity Regional Board was consecrated here. The permission to build a new church was signed by Voivode of Białystok Voivodeship, Kazimierz Dunaj in March 1981 and the construction permit was given in February 1983.

They were found at the very end of the 19th century at Batn Ihrit (the site of ancient Theadelphia), in the Faiyum area of Egypt by Bernard Pyne Grenfell and Arthur Surridge Hunt. The archive is named after Heroninos, the phrontistes (Koine Greek: manager) of the estate whose records make up a large part of the collection.\nAs well as being the largest single collection of papyri from Roman Egypt, it is also significant for the in-depth picture it gives of the running of a Roman estate. To date, less than half of the documents in the archive have been published. Scholars believe that when it is all published, it will represent  one of the largest coherent groups of documents from the Roman Empire. \nOrigin of the archive\nThe archive contains around a thousand papyrus documents. The bulk of the documents are records relating to the management of an estate belonging to Aurelius Appianus. For the period from late-249 to mid-268, the manager of the estate was a man named Heroninos. Most of the letters in the archive are addressed to Heroninos, and come from the managers of other estates in the Arsinoites nome (the area of modern Faiyum), or from the central administration of the estate, which was based in the nome capital of Arsinoe",

They were led by a head official called Alypios.\nIn many cases, the papyrus is significantly older than the document written on it. Reuse of writing materials was a common practice on the Appianus estate, and many of the Heroninos documents feature fragments of earlier texts on the recto, primarily to do with the business of the town council of Arsinoe. One of these documents has been dated to 144 using prosopographical techniques.\nThe documents are not considered to have come from a filing system. Evidence in the archive shows that another employee of the estate, an epiktenites named Hermias, collated documents by pasting them end to end to form a single length which could be rolled up (a tomos sunkollesimos); while another letter to a farm manager suggests that this man was in the habit of throwing letters in a cupboard and forgetting about them. Nothing suggests that Heroninos pasted his letters together.

Several scholars have cast doubt upon this story   P.Fay.133 had been found independently before the discovery of the archive, and BGU 1030 and SB 5807 were uncovered in ruined houses by another team of archaeologists. The publication in 1998 of another letter, which had been included in the material excavated by Grenfell and Hunt in the 1898 99 season, but not included by them in the Heroninos archive, casts further doubt. However Mariarosaria Salvo, who translated and published the letter, still considers it possible that the bulk of the archive was in a box at some time.\nThe archive was broken up in the early 20th century, and sold to dealers. Over twenty major papyrological collections hold parts of the archive, although significant portions went to the Laurentian Library in Florence, the University Library of Prague, and the National Library of Austria.

This information was then summarised on pieces of papyrus scroll into one big yearly account for each particular sub-division of the estate. Entries were arranged by sector, with cash expenses and gains extrapolated from all the different sectors.

Many of his students subsequently played important roles in the Meiji Restoration and the westernization of Japan in the Meiji period. His true name was Ogata Koreaki (緒方 惟章) or Ogata Akira (緒方 章); the name of Kōan was his courtesy name.\nBiography\nOgata was born in 1810 to a family of low-ranking samurai of Ashimori Domain in Bitchū Province in what is now part of the city of Okayama. He moved to Osaka in 1825 with his father, and began studies in rangaku and medicine at a private academy run by Naka Tenyū from 1826. In 1831, he relocated to Edo to continue his studies in western medicine, returning to Nagasaki in 1836 to study under the Dutch doctor Erdewin Johannes Niemann, despite the Tokugawa shogunate's strict national isolation policy.\nIn 1838, Ogata returned to Osaka to establish his medical practice, and in the same year established the Tekijuku, an academy of rangaku studies, where he taught medicine, natural history",

Ogata used his small but precious collection of Dutch books, including a Dutch-Japanese dictionary and a Dutch encyclopedia, to teach his pupils to read scientific Dutch texts. He also wrote several books, including a treatise entitled How to treat cholera, which he compiled in haste from various European sources during the great cholera epidemic of 1858.\nFrom December 1849, he struggled to gain acceptance of the new smallpox vaccination, eventually opening 186 vaccination centers from Edo to Kyushu, and obtaining official recognition of the method in 1858. In 1862, Ogata was appointed personal physician to shōgun Tokugawa Iemochi, who supported the introduction of western medicine and the establishment of a western medicine research institute in Edo. However, Ogata died a few months later in July 1863 of acute hemoptysis, caused by the tuberculosis he had suffered from for many years.\nHis house still exists in downtown Osaka.

A paperback and audiobook release was also published during the same year; the audiobook is narrated by T. Ryder Smith. Set during the Great Depression, the book follows one man's attempt to take his revenge against the one who murdered his daughter. It has been described by the Los Angeles Review of Books as featuring  a band of Depression-era hobo vigilantes who trek across the Dust Bowl after the supernatural boogeyman, a metaphorical specter who haunts the starved nation .\nAfter its release the book won several literary awards, including the 2010 Shirley Jackson Award for Best Novel.\nSynopsis\nThe novel follows the character of Marcus Connelly, a man whose marriage deteriorated after his beloved daughter is murdered by a man known only as the  Shiver Man . Intent on finding him and making him pay for his crimes, Connelly sets out on the rails and travels from location to location in search of work and clues. While he faces several setbacks   as well as several warnings to leave the killer alone   Connelly finds support via other travelers who are also looking to bring about the Shiver Man's death.

Along the way it becomes apparent that the Shiver Man is more than he seems, as he is capable of escaping any prison cell and other feats that would be impossible for normal human beings.\nDevelopment\nFor the book, Bennett chose to set the novel during the Great Depression as  just mentioning its name summons up a world in the reader s head  and has specified that Mr. Shivers is set in  the idea of The Great Depression, the one we all have  and that he was  playing around with our own myths , as he felt that the United States does not  get the cool King Arthur origin story . He also felt that hobo culture would fit in the novel as he saw it as being  untapped in horror fantasy  and that the  idea of an American hobo is already half-founded in tall tales and folklore . The titular character of Mr. Shivers was partially based on an incident from Bennett's childhood, when he came across a man smoking a cigarette under a bridge. Bennett stated that the man  waved at me like he recognized me, and smiled, and it wasn t a nice smile. Funny thing was, I felt like I recognized him, too. \nCritical reception\nCritical reception for Mr. Shivers has been generally positive, with The Guardian stating that the book was  a startling début, a deft amalgam of thriller, cerebral",

Common praise for the book centers on Bennett's writing, as Tor.com's Stefan Raets stated that  If the setting s what pulled me into the novel, Robert Jackson Bennett s spectacular prose is what sold me . The setting was also frequently highlighted favorably in reviews, as Michael Dirda of The Washington Post felt that it was  convincingly bleak  while also praising the titular character and comparing him to Hannibal Lecter. Barry Forshaw of the Daily Express also drew comparisons, comparing Bennett to Stephen King and John Steinbeck. SF Signal and the Historical Novel Society also reviewed the book, with the former stating that while readers familiar with science fiction, horror, and fantasy tropes would find some parts of the book predictable, it was also a  very strong debut novel .\nBennett has stated that some readers have complained that the book did not have enough gore or that although it was shelved as horror, that they did not see it as a horror novel. Of this, Bennett has commented that he was  not going to write straight fantasy, or straight horror, or straight anything  as have enough gore or that although it was shelved as horror, that they did not see it as a horror novel. Of this, Bennett has commented that he was  not going to write straight fantasy, or straight horror, or straight anything  as he viewed it as dull.\nAwards\nMr. Shivers won the 2010 Shirley Jackson Award for Best Novel and the 2011 Sydney J.

Vale as a church for the nearby Wesleyan Theological Institution and opened in 1877. The building was converted into an office space in 1990. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building.\nHistory\nSt Paul's Church was built as a memorial to the local philanthropist and MP, James Heald of Parrs Wood. It was designed by the Liverpudlian architect H.H. Vale, who at the time was also collaborating with Cornelius Sherlock on the design of the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool. During the project, Vale committed suicide, and the church was completed by T D Barry   Sons. Construction lasted from 1875 to 1877.\nArchitecture\nBuilt in the Victorian Gothic style, Vale's church displays freely interpreted elements of Early English and Geometrical Decorated Gothic architecture. The layout is cruciform with a belfry and steeple on the south-west corner. The stonework is sandstone and architectural elements typical of the style are used throughout, such as lancet windows and foliar decoration, with dormer windows along the nave.\nThe interior is noted for its arcades of polished Aberdeen granite and Irish marble columns with carved capitals, encaustic tiled floors, a painted panelled barrel roof, richly carved stonework which",

He studied medicine at the University of Vienna, from where he graduated in 1849.\nCareer and research\nIn 1851, shortly after the retirement of professor TA Catullus, he was appointed by the Austrian Government to be the successor as professor of natural sciences at the University of Padua. He started dual teaching in zoology and mineralogy on 4 February 1852. From 1856 he began to devote himself to research in ichthyology.\nOn 13 January 1856 he was elected as member of the Academy of Sciences, Letters and Arts in Padua.

Bigger cities and metropolitan areas are most popular as they are deemed to be more tolerant and tend to have  a history of progressive local government policy towards supporting and financing LGBTQ-friendly initiatives.  There is also a noted circular pattern of migration, whereby once areas have established a reputation as somewhere LGBT people live, more LGBT people are drawn there. LGBT-inclusive areas of UK towns and cities tend to be defined by  a distinct geographic focal point, a unique culture, a cluster of commercial spaces  and sometimes a concentration of residences. It is thought that LGBT-inclusive areas help towns and cities in the UK to prosper economically, but some believe the building of such areas creates an isolating effect on some LGBT people who want to blend in.\nBirmingham\nBirmingham is home to 60,000 gay people. The Birmingham Gay Village, which became prominent in the 1990s, is located around Hurst Street in Southside and features clubs, bars and shops.\nBirmingham Pride is celebrated each year around the late May bank holiday weekend; its entertainment and festivities are centred around the Gay Village.

    "text": " a brown iris, a thin and pointed black bill, and medium gray legs and feet.\nDistribution and habitat\nThe buff-banded tyrannulet is found from northern Puno Department in southeastern Peru south through Bolivia into northwestern Argentina's Jujuy Province. It inhabits humid montane evergreen forest in the subtropical zone, especially cloudforest with much moss, and also Podocarpus forest. In elevation it occurs between 1,100 and 2,600 m (3,600 and 8,500 ft) in Bolivia and between 1,500 and 2,300 m (4,900 and 7,500 ft) in Argentina.\nBehavior\nMovement\nThe buff-banded tyrannulet is believed to be a year-round resident throughout its range though it might be only a non-breeding migrant in Peru.\nFeeding\nThe buff-banded tyrannulet's diet has not been detailed. It usually forages singly and often joins mixed-species feeding flocks. It forages mostly in the forest's mid-story to the canopy. It takes most of its food by gleaning from leaves and twigs while perched, though it occasionally makes short upward flights to briefly hover.\nBreeding\nA juvenile buff-banded tyrannulet was recorded in May in Bolivia. Nothing else is known about the species' breeding biology.\nVocalization\nThe buff-banded tyrannulet's call is  a plaintive, slightly falling pseee or psee-psee-psee  with two to five notes.\nStatus\nThe IUCN has assessed the buff-banded tyrannulet as being of Least Concern. It has a large range; its population size is not known and is believed to be stable. No immediate threats have been identified. It is considered rare in Peru, as either a resident or migrant, and uncommon in Bolivia and Argentina. It occurs in every protected area within its Bolivian and Argentinian range.\n   References",

He then pursued further studies in Spain, receiving his Licentiate in Laws from the University of Seville in 1878 and a Doctor of Laws degree from the Universidad Central de Madrid in 1879. He then returned to the Philippines the following year. Prior to the Philippine Revolution, he worked as a judge in Bulacan and Ilocos Norte and was even appointed by the Spanish colonial government in Cuba to serve as secretary of the Real Audiencia de La Habana, the highest court in the island, in 1897, although it is uncertain whether he took up the post as he was replaced after just a few months.\nDuring the Philippine Revolution, he participated in the Comité Conspirador, which overthrew the Spanish regime in Iloilo in 1898, and became president of the Estado Federal de Visayas, a short-lived revolutionary government in Panay from 1898 to 1899.

Reaching the rank of general himself, he helped support the installment of Martin Delgado as head of all revolutionary forces in the Visayas.\nDuring the American occupation, Melliza served as Governor of Iloilo from 1904 to 1906. He then retired from politics until 1935, when he ran unsuccessfully as a candidate of the National Socialist Party for Vice President in elections for the Philippine Commonwealth as a running-mate of former President Emilio Aguinaldo, losing to Sergio Osmeña. In this effort, he was only able to win in Aguinaldo's bailiwick of Cavite. He ran again in the 1941 Philippine general election, this time as a senatorial candidate under the Popular Front ticket of Senator Juan Sumulong and Emilio Javier, but he was again unsuccessful, placing 37th in a field of 102 senatorial candidates.\nMelliza was a resident of Molo, now a district of Iloilo City. His ancestral home is now a tourist attraction of the city.\nSupposed connection with Jose Rizal\nMelliza was claimed to have been friends with the Philippines' national hero Jose Rizal, who supposedly stopped by Melliza's home in Molo to have lunch with him on his way to Manila from his exile in Dapitan to catch a ship that would take him to Cuba, where he planned to serve as a doctor, in 1896.

In flashbacks, it's shown that Leda also struggled with being a young mother to her two daughters, Bianca and Martha, often losing her patience and becoming withdrawn from her family.\nOne evening, Leda has dinner with Lyle, her holiday apartment's caretaker, who sees that she has the doll but doesn't comment on it, nor does he tell Nina. Leda later discovers Nina is having an affair with Will, who works at the beach bar, and Nina explains that her husband Toni is very controlling. The search for Elena's doll continues, with Nina even putting up flyers offering a reward for its return.\nAt a market, Leda buys Nina a hatpin to help hold her sunhat in place. When Nina asks Leda about her daughters, Leda becomes emotional; she reveals that she had abandoned them for three years after she became too overwhelmed, leaving them with her now ex-husband, during which time she had an affair with a fellow professor. She admits that being away from her daughters felt  amazing , and she only went back to them when she genuinely missed them.

The movie is never great, but it's never exactly dull. There's always a reason to stick around for the next scene. \nJeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times wrote:  Equal parts troubling and affecting, Leda epitomizes a type of woman whose needs are rarely addressed in American mainstream movies. We can dislike her, but we are never permitted to revile her.  Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune wrote Gyllenhaal  keeps a close eye on what brings out the best in a scene, and in a story worth telling, with morally imperfect, fully dimensional, persistently human characters. \nAlissa Wilkinson of Vox wrote  The movie captures the spirit of the novel well. It's suspenseful, but it's not a thriller; there are elements of obsession and eroticism, but they never quite go where you expect. The end is deeply ambiguous, neither punishing nor condoning its characters' behavior. It simply asks us to sit with them   to pay them the respect of attention, and learn something about ourselves in the process. \nActress and filmmaker Olivia Wilde praised the film, particularly Gyllenhaal's direction by saying  This unflinching new filmmaker only has time for the most interesting questions, it seems, and will not sanitize the narrative for our comfort. We have been warned: Maggie Gyllenhaal is here to push us to be a braver audience, and I, for one, am lapping it up from the front row. \nIn June 2025, IndieWire ranked the film at number 31 on its list of  The 100 Best Movies of the 2020s (So Far) .\nAccolades\nReferences\nExternal links\nThe Lost Daughter at IMDb\nOfficial screenplay",

The remaining cars were equipped with air brakes after 1918.\nAfter the M MTB take-over, the original HTT French grey livery was replaced by a brown colour scheme and fleet number of each tramcar was increased by 106; a simplification of the alphanumeric classification scheme saw the whole class being added to the C class (which had originally been allocated to the 1913 P MTT Maximum Traction bogie trams). Improvements over the following years included the fitting of air brakes, route number boxes, and roof-mounted destination boxes being replaced by the standard Melbourne boxes; seating capacity was reduced to 44 when an aisle was cut-through the drop centre cross-bench seats. By the 1930s when they had been painted in the standard Melbourne green colours, these trams resembled a smaller version of the ubiquitous Melbourne W class trams. Tramcars that survived to serve during World War II had their rear doorways blanked-off as a safety measure.\nOne car, number 121, was scrapped in 1938, whilst 125 was placed into storage in 1940 and the body was later sold in early 1945.

A Wii U sequel, Kirby and the Rainbow Curse, was released in 2015. The game was rereleased for the Wii U's Virtual Console in Europe and Australia in December 2015 (as Power Paintbrush in both regions), in Japan in February 2016, and in North America in October 2016.\nGameplay\nThe player only uses the stylus and touch screen to control Kirby, who rolls around in ball form. The player can draw rainbow lines, which Kirby will roll on. These rainbow paths can form ramps or bridges for Kirby to cross, or walls to protect him from enemy projectiles. Drawing paths depletes the player's rainbow ink supplies, which recharges slowly while Kirby is in the air or on a path, but quickly when Kirby is on the ground.\nThe player can use the stylus to stun enemies by tapping on them. Afterwards, the player can either allow Kirby to roll into the enemy with his own momentum or by dashing to defeat the enemy.

Defeating certain kinds of enemies by either dashing into them or touching them while stunned causes Kirby to gain one of several special abilities, which may be used at any time by tapping Kirby himself. \nKirby: Canvas Curse spans eight worlds, with all but one having three levels. A variety of themes are used throughout the game. These themes range from a volcanic area to a frozen area. The objective of every level in the game is to reach a rainbow-colored doorway. Occasionally, Kirby will come across a barrier, which prevents the paint lines from being created inside of them, forcing Kirby to do nothing, but roll, dash, and use a power (if applicable).

These medals may be obtained through the main levels, through defeating bosses, or through the Rainbow Run challenge mode, where Kirby must complete a portion of one of the main levels, with the objective being either getting through it as fast as possible, or getting through it while trying to use as little paint as possible.\nPlot\nOne day, a strange portal appears in the sky, and out of it comes the witch Drawcia. Drawcia casts a spell over Dream Land, turning it into a world of paint. Upon fleeing back into the portal she came through, Kirby gives chase, finding himself in Drawcia's paint-themed world. The witch curses Kirby, turning him into a limbless ball. After Drawcia escapes, the Magical Paintbrush (Power Paintbrush in the European version) turns to the player to help Kirby. Kirby sets off to find and defeat Drawcia to restore Dream Land to its normal state. Along the way, Drawcia creates replicas of Kirby's oldest opponents to slow him down.

In Japan, four critics from Famitsu gave the game a total score of 34 out of 40.\n1UP.com called it  genuinely excellent , saying that  it's a welcome reinvention of gaming's most overplayed genre  and later concluded that Canvas Curse is  the DS's first great game . The stylus gameplay has also been noted, with IGN hailing it as  incredibly innovative , GameSpy calling it  quite rewarding , and GameSpot calling it  a satisfying part of the gameplay.  Official Nintendo Magazine ranked it the 96th best game available on Nintendo platforms. On the other hand, Play's editor disagreed, noting that  it's innovative... but for me, that's not enough. \nThe New York Times gave it a very favorable review and called it  tremendous fun .

However, Detroit Free Press gave it three stars out of four, stating that  there is some nice innovation, such as levels that are completely black until Kirby bumps into lanterns that put off light. And as we all know, in dark places like this, it's good to have a friend. \nSales\nKirby: Canvas Curse was the third best-selling game in Japan during its week of release at 75,365 units sold. Famitsu annual sales for the region show that the game sold 276,418 copies by the end of 2005. According to the NPD Group, the game sold just under 80,000 copies in North America during the month of June 2005. The following month, it was the top-selling DS game in the region at 50,000 copies.\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial site Archived 2017-08-20 at the Wayback Machine\nKirby: Canvas Curse at IMDb\nKirby: Canvas Curse at MobyGames",

Under the command of Major-General Aylmer Hunter-Weston, the division fought throughout the Gallipoli Campaign, including the original landing at Cape Helles. From 1916 to the end of the war the division fought on the Western Front in Belgium and France.\nAccording to the published divisional history (see reference below), 'The total casualties of the 29th Division amounted to something like 94,000. Gallipoli alone accounted for 34,000. This must be, if not a record, among the highest totals in any division ... The number of Victoria Crosses won by members of this division was 27 (12 at Gallipoli). This constitutes a record'. A large commemorative Portland stone obelisk, built in 1921 to remember the Division's review by King George V before they were sent to Gallipoli, is located on a roundabout on the A45 just north of Stretton-on-Dunsmore, Warwickshire. A memorial to the 29th Division is located in Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial.

The division was there for the duration of the ill-fated campaign. It made the first landings as part of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force in April 1915. On the morning of 25 April 1915 the Battle of Gallipoli began when battalions from the division's 86th and 87th Brigades landed at five beaches around Cape Helles at the tip of the peninsula under the command of Major-General Aylmer Hunter-Weston. Three of the landings faced little or no opposition but were not exploited. The two main landings, at V and W Beaches on either side of the cape, met with fierce Turkish resistance and the landing battalions were decimated.\nThe original objectives of the first day of the campaign had been the village of Krithia and the nearby hill of Achi Baba. The first concerted attempt to capture these was made by the division three days after the landings on 28 April. In this First Battle of",

The first concerted attempt to capture these was made by the division three days after the landings on 28 April. In this First Battle of Krithia an advance up the peninsula was made but the division was halted short of its objective and suffered around 3,000 casualties. The attack was resumed on 6 May with the launch of the Second Battle of Krithia. On this occasion the 88th Brigade attacked along Fig Tree Spur and, after two days of fighting without significant progress, it was relieved by the New Zealand Infantry Brigade. On 24 May Major-General Beauvoir De Lisle took over command of the division.\nOn 4 June the 88th Brigade was once more required to make an advance along Fig Tree Spur in the Third Battle of Krithia. In the subsequent counter-attacks, Second Lieutenant G.R.D Moor of the 2nd Hampshires was awarded the Victoria Cross for shooting four of his own men who attempted to retreat.\nThe division finally saw successful fighting at Helles during the Battle of Gully Ravine on 28 June when the 86th Brigade managed to advance along Gully Spur. As a prelude to the launch of the August Offensive, a  diversion  was carried out at Helles on 6 August to prevent the Turks withdrawing troops. In what became known as the Battle of Krithia",

The 29th Division had been moved from Helles to Suvla to participate. The 87th Brigade was briefly able to capture the summit of the hill but was soon forced to retreat.\nThe division was evacuated from Gallipoli on 2 January 1916 and moved to Egypt before being sent to France in March.\nSomme\nPassing through the Mediterranean port of Marseilles the 29th Division arrived in the rear of the Somme battle front from 15 to 29 March 1916.

Lee's chief of artillery during the American Civil War. It lies on the Atlantic coast slightly east of Naval Air Station Oceana.\nSince Camp Pendleton is owned by the State of Virginia and not the federal government, the facility was not covered by The Naming Commission's mandate to rename US military installations. However, in January 2021 Governor Ralph Northam  directed his administration to review and recommend a replacement name for Camp Pendleton . Northam was unable to rename this base before he was replaced as governor in January 2022 by Glenn Youngkin who decided not to continue his predecessor's uncompleted work. By March 2023, the Virginia National Guard added this statement to the installation's official website:  The Virginia National Guard no longer uses the Camp Pendleton designation and now refers to it only by the original name of the State Military Reservation .\nHistory\nThe facility was laid out in 1911, with construction beginning in 1912, as the State Rifle Range for the use of the state militia. Between 1922 and 1942, it was named after the then serving Governor of Virginia, being firstly named Camp Trinkle (1922 1926), then Camp Byrd (1926 1930), Camp Pollard (1930 1934",

During both World Wars, the base was federalized. In World War I it was used by the U.S. Navy for coastal artillery training (more likely the Army, as the Navy had no coastal artillery function and the source states it was an alternative to the Coast Artillery Corps' Camp Eustis) and during World War II it was controlled by the U.S. Army, who first applied the name Camp Pendleton. The 50th Coast Artillery Regiment, with 24 mobile 155 mm guns, was organized at Camp Pendleton in February 1942 and elements remained there until December 1942. The 53rd Coast Artillery Regiment was activated there on 20 July 1942 with personnel from an inactivated portion of the 13th Coast Artillery.\nNational Register of Historic Places\nThe Camp Pendleton-State Military Reservation Historic District was designated a historic district and listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 26, 2005.

A second major construction phase began in 1919, during which the U.S. Navy focused on improvements to the rifle range. Those buildings have also been demolished, but the layout of both the first and second phase remains. The third and final phase of construction was the responsibility of the U.S. Army during World War II; most of the camp's remaining buildings date from that phase. At the time it was listed on the National Register, Camp Pendleton had 108 buildings in a condition good enough to qualify them as contributing properties.\nCurrent use\nCamp Pendleton's primary purpose is the training of the Virginia National Guard, as well as other states' National Guard units and components of the U.S. Armed Forces.

In 2010 Virginia almost removed funding for the program, but it was restored by the then-governor.\nSince shortly after World War II a 2,000 square feet (190 m2) home on the camp has served as a vacation spot for the presiding governor of Virginia. The architecture of this home is in the same style as the rest of the camp. It has vinyl siding. The  cottage  was originally built in 1915 and initially served as the commanding officer's residence. From 2004 until 2014, the United States Naval Sea Cadet Corps conducted summer and winter boot camps at Camp Pendleton.\nFuture\nWhen the facility was created it was in a relatively remote, sparsely populated area. Since then, the City of Virginia Beach has grown and developed around it, leading to concerns over safety issues. Over time, hundreds of acres of land belonging to the camp have been sold to the city of Virginia Beach. The role of Camp Pendleton is also changing, as more National Guard training takes place at the much larger Fort Pickett, lessening the importance of Camp Pendleton. This has led to repeated requests by the City authorities to convert it to other uses, including complete or partial conversion to a state park. The findings of a report completed at the behest of the Virginia General Assembly on November 22, 1998 were that it was not feasible at that time to convert Camp Pendleton to a state park because of the demands of long-term planning, coordination with the federal government, and environmental reclamation.\nSee also\nList of U.S. Army installations named for Confederate soldiers\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Virginia Beach, Virginia\nReferences\nExternal links\nCamp Pendleton State Military Reservation: Virginia National Guard\nGeocaching info on Camp Pendleton\nUS Army info on Camp Pendleton",

It is part of a group of five lakes of glacial origin, which also include Lake Sirio, Lake Nero, Lake Campagna, and Lake San Michele. It is fed by the Rio Montesino stream, which collects water descending from Punta Montesino, while at the western end, there is an artificial canal that once supplied a mill. The outflow of water is regulated by a small dam.\nThe entire lake is surrounded by a trail. On the northern side, at the top of Mount Crovero, stands the imposing Montalto Dora Castle, which is reflected in the waters of the lake below.\nArchaeological park\nThanks to an archaeological excavation campaign conducted by the Superintendence of Archaeology, Fine Arts, and Landscape of Turin, traces of a lakeside village dating back to the Neolithic were uncovered on the shores of the lake in June 2003.\nIn 2005, a cultural and tourist project was launched, culminating in 2012 with the inauguration of an exhibition space showcasing the artifacts discovered during the excavations. This was followed, in 2017, by the opening of an archaeological park on the lakeshore, where Neolithic structures have been reconstructed at full scale.\nNature protection\nThe lake is part of the Site of Community Importance known as Laghi di Ivrea (code IT1110021), established under Directive 92 43 EEC (Habitats Directive) and designated as a Special Area of Conservation.\nGallery\nReferences\nExternal links\n Media related to Lago Pistono at Wikimedia Commons",

    "text": "The cover date of a periodical publication is the date displayed on the cover, which is not necessarily the true date of publication (the on-sale date or release date); later cover dates are common in magazine and comic book publishing. More unusually, Le Monde is a daily newspaper published the afternoon before its cover date. For some publications, the cover date may not be found on the cover, but rather on an inside jacket or on an interior page.\nMagazines\nIn the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, the standard practice is to display on magazine covers a date which is some weeks or months in the future from the publishing or release date. There are two reasons for this discrepancy: first, to allow magazines to continue appearing  current  to consumers even after they have been on sale for some time (since not all magazines will be sold immediately), and second, to inform newsstands when an unsold magazine can be removed from the stands and returned to the publishing company or be destroyed (in this case, the cover date is also the pull date).\nWeeklies (such as Time and Newsweek) are generally dated a week ahead. Monthlies (such as National Geographic) are generally dated two to three months ahead, and quarterlies are generally dated half a month ahead.\nIn other countries, the cover date usually matches more closely the date of publication, and may indeed be identical where weekly magazines are concerned.\nIn all markets, it is rare for monthly magazines to indicate a",

For example, a 1951 issue of Superman which had the cover date of July would have been published two months earlier from that date in the month of May, generally speaking. In 1973 the discrepancy between the cover date and the publishing date went from two months to three months. In 1989 the cover date and publishing date discrepancy was changed back to two months, though generally each comic book company now uses its own system.\nThe two major American comic book publishers, DC Comics and Marvel Comics, have both discontinued the use of cover dates. Marvel Comics opted against putting cover dates on the cover in October 1999; instead, the  cover  date was moved to the indicia on an interior page. DC Comics discontinued the practice in 2018, also moving the date dates.

Its composition was the one resulting from the general election of 26 and 27 June 1983. The election was called by President Sandro Pertini one year before the previous legislature's natural end on 5 May 1983, after a crisis in the incumbent government majority (Pentapartito).\nHistory\nThe Pentaparty formula, the governative alliance between five centrist parties created in 1981, caused unexpected problems to Christian Democracy (DC). The alliance was fixed and universal, extended both to the national government and to the local administrations. Considering that the 1983 election result did not longer depend by the strength of the DC, but by the strength of the entire Pentapartito, centrist electors began to look at the Christian Democratic vote as not necessary to prevent a Communist success. More, voting for one of the four minor parties of the alliance was seen as a form of moderate protest against the government without giving advantages to the PCI.\nIn this context, the figure of the socialist leader Bettino Craxi emerged. As leader of Italian Socialist Party (PSI), since 1976 Craxi had tried to undermine the Communist Party, which until then had been continuously increasing its votes in elections, and to consolidate",

As leader of Italian Socialist Party (PSI), since 1976 Craxi had tried to undermine the Communist Party, which until then had been continuously increasing its votes in elections, and to consolidate the PSI as a modern, strongly pro-European reformist social-democratic party, with deep roots in the democratic left-wing. This strategy called for ending most of the party's historical traditions as a working-class trade union based party and attempting to gain new support among white-collar and public sector employees.\nEven if the PSI never became a serious electoral challenger either to the PCI or the DC, its pivotal position in the political arena allowed it to claim the post of prime minister for Craxi after the 1983 general election. The electoral support for the Christian Democrats was significantly weakened. The PSI threatened to leave the parliamentary majority unless Craxi was made prime minister. The Christian Democrats accepted this compromise to avoid a new election and Craxi became the first Socialist in the history of the Italian Republic to be appointed prime minister.\nStarting from 1983, Craxi led the third longest-lived government of Italy during the republican era, being a close ally of two key figures of DC, Giulio Andreotti and Arnaldo Forlani, in a loose cross-party alliance often dubbed CAF. Craxi had a firm grasp on a party previously troubled by factionalism, and tried to distance it from the Communists and to bring it",

Craxi had a firm grasp on a party previously troubled by factionalism, and tried to distance it from the Communists and to bring it closer to Christian Democrats and other parties. During Craxi's tenure as prime minister, Italy became the fifth largest industrial nation in the world. However, inflation was often in the double digits. Against trade union resistance, Craxi reacted by abolishing wage-price indexation (a mechanism known as scala mobile or  escalator ), under which wages had been increased automatically in line with inflation. Abolishing the escalator system did help reduce inflation, which was also falling in other major countries, but in the long term it inevitably increased industrial action as workers had to bargain for better salaries. In any event, the victory of the  No  campaign in the 1985 referendum called by the Italian Communist Party was a major victory for Craxi.\nIn domestic policy, a number of reforms were initiated during Craxi's time in office. In 1984, solidarity contracts (work-sharing arrangements to avoid redundancies) were introduced, while restrictions on part-time employment were relaxed. In the field of family welfare, legislation was enacted in 1984 and 1986 that changed the family allowance system  so that people most in need received larger amounts and coverage was progressively reduced to the point of termination once certain income levels were exceeded.",

During that period, he accompanied and performed with Bobby Darin, Billy Eckstine, and Peggy Lee, playing fourteen shows a week.\nIn 1973, he returned to jazz and formed the Chuck Anderson Trio with Al Stauffer on bass and Ray Deeley on drums. Four years later, he got the staff guitar job at Valley Forge Music Fair in Devon, Pennsylvania. He worked with Nancy Wilson, Michel LeGrand, and Anthony Newley. In the years that followed, he concentrated on teaching, composing, and session work.\nHe has written a column,  The Art and Science of Jazz , for the web magazine All About Jazz.\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial site",

Ryer and Violet Pearl (Hartman) Ryer. She had one sibling, Bernice Ryer Collmer. Throughout her life she was referred to alternately as  Maxine  and  Evelyn. \nRyer graduated from South Bend High School in 1916, where she was active in dramatic arts and performed in the initial play given at  the first Little Theater ever opened by a high school in America.  She subsequently attended Nazareth Academy in Kalamazoo, Michigan to study violin and drama. By 1920 she was offering violin lessons to pupils in South Bend.\nLaw studies and bar admission\nRyer enrolled in 1921 as the first female law student at the University of Notre Dame. She also began serving as a clerk in the law office of former South Bend City Attorney Frank H. Dunnahoo.\nOn September 12, 1922, Ryer passed an examination and became the first woman admitted to the St. Joseph County (Indiana) bar for active practice in court. Bar examinations in Indiana were conducted on a local, rather than state-wide, basis until 1931. Three women had previously been admitted to the local bar, but did not practice law. In April 1923 she was admitted to practice before the federal courts and Supreme Court of the State of Indiana. She is not included in the Student Directory at Notre Dame in 1922 23 and does not appear to have received a degree from the university.\nPersonal life and death\nRyer married Everett Miller in St. Joseph, Berrien County, Michigan on May 25, 1925. She died on June 12, 1930, in South Bend, Indiana, of heart disease. She did not have any children.\n   References",

It has been restored many times, including in 1756 (after a roof collapse), in 1835 when the facade was decorated with Rococo stuccoes, and in 1931. Due to declining use resulting from a dropping Jewish population, it was closed in 1956. It hadn't been in much use since 1948, when its Torah ark was sent to Israel (currently located in the synagogue in Carmiel). It was later damaged in a landslide that decade, and sat vacant until its renovation by the municipality, finishing in 1995 after nearly 10 years of construction.\nThe synagogue and its adjacent museum are open for visitors on all days except for the Sabbath. It is not used very often due to an inability to get a minyan. An 18th-century Hannukiah from the synagogue is on display in the Italian Synagogue in Jerusalem.

He is only known from a letter he wrote in Aramaic to his son, who was named Serapion, which refers to the execution of  the wise king of the Jews  and may be an early non-Christian reference to Jesus of Nazareth.\nThe letter indicates that Mara's homeland was Samosata, i.e. modern-day Samsat, Turkey (on the west bank of the Euphrates), but his captivity appears to have been in Seleucia, in modern-day Iraq (on the west bank of the Tigris River).\nMara's captivity took place after the AD 72 annexation of Samosata by the Romans, but before the third century. Most scholars date it to shortly after AD 73 during the first century.\nThe letter to his son\nMara's letter to his son begins with:  Mara, son of Serapion, to Serapion, my son: peace.  The letter was composed sometime between 73 AD and the 3rd century. There were three cases when captives were taken from Samosata, in 72 AD by the Romans, in 161 162 by Par",

There were three cases when captives were taken from Samosata, in 72 AD by the Romans, in 161 162 by Parthians and in 256 by Sasanians and various scholars have presented arguments for each date. Robert Van Voorst (who himself thinks the letter was composed in the second century) states that most scholars date the letter to shortly after AD 73 during the first century.\nThe letter is preserved in a 6th- or 7th-century manuscript (BL Add. 14658) held by the British Library. Nineteenth-century records state that the manuscript containing this text was one of several manuscripts obtained by Henry Tattam from the monastery of St. Mary Deipara in the Nitrian Desert of Egypt and acquired by the Library in 1843.\nMara's religion\nA number of scholars such as Sebastian Brock, Fergus Millar, Ute Possekel and Craig A. Evans, among others, state that Mara was a pagan. Gerd Theissen states that Mara's reference to  our gods  indicates that he was neither a Jew, nor a Christian, the letter stating:\nThou hast heard, moreover, concerning our companions, that, when they were leaving Samosata, they were distressed about it, and, as if complaining of the time in which their lot was cast, said thus:",

Elwell and Robert W. Yarbrough state that Mara could hardly have been a Christian . Robert E. Van Voorst on the other hand states that the reference to  our gods  is a single reference, which was while quoting his fellow captives, and Mara may have been a monotheist. Van Voorst adds two factors that indicate Mara was not a Christian, the first being his failure to mention the terms Jesus or Christ. The second factor (also supported by Chilton and Evans) is that Mara's statement that Jesus lives on based on the wisdom of his teachings, in contrast to the Christian concept that Jesus continues to live through his resurrection, indicates that he was not a Christian.\nChilton and Evans also state that the use of the term  wise king  to refer to Jesus (rather than a religious designation) indicates that Mara's perception of the events had been formed by non-Christian sources. They state that the term  king of the Jews  has never been seen in the Christian literature of antiquity as a title for Jesus",

Located near Ma'ale Adumim, it falls under the jurisdiction of Mateh Binyamin Regional Council. In 2006 around 90 families were living in the settlement. In 2009 about 140 families lived there. Both religious and secular families live in Nofei Prat.\nThe international community considers Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this.\nHistory\nThe village was established in 1992 by a group of settlers from Jerusalem. It was named after the nearby Prat Stream. On the morning after the elections for the thirteenth Knesset and Israeli Labor Party victory and before the transition of power was made, a mixed group of mostly single religious and non-religious students from the Hebrew University drove east from Jerusalem to a barren hilltop with a plan to create a mixed community. They erected a flimsy structure which would later that day be followed by twenty-seven trailers.\nLegal Status\nNofei Prat is widely regarded by the international community as illegal under international law according to the Fourth Geneva Convention (article 49), which prohibits an occupying power from transferring citizens from its own territory to occupied territory.

Israel maintains that international conventions relating to occupied land do not apply to the West Bank because they were not under the legitimate sovereignty of any state in the first place. This view was rejected by the International Court of Justice and the International Committee of the Red Cross.\nAccording to the ARIJ, Nofei Prat is located on land confiscated from the Palestinian town of 'Anata. According to Geoffrey Aronson, Nofei Prat was established as a neighborhood of the settlement of Kfar Adumim in order to circumvent a promise not to construct new settlements.\nTransportation\nNofei Prat was one of a number of settlements linked by a road secretly built by settlers in 1995. The road links Anatot to Kfar Adumim, Nofei Prat, and Alon. According to Pinhas Wallerstein, then head of the Mateh Binyamin Regional Council, the road was one of a number of secretly built roads under construction in the area. Wallerstein claimed that as council head, he did not need permission to construct roads, but that he would stop construction if the Israel Defense Forces told him to. He also said  What are they going to do, tell us to take the road away?

    "text": "A leaf (pl.: leaves) is a principal appendage of the stem of a vascular plant, usually borne laterally above ground and specialized for photosynthesis. Leaves are collectively called foliage, as in  autumn foliage , while the leaves, stem, flower, and fruit collectively form the shoot system. In most leaves, the primary photosynthetic tissue is the palisade mesophyll and is located on the upper side of the blade or lamina of the leaf, but in some species, including the mature foliage of Eucalyptus, palisade mesophyll is present on both sides and the leaves are said to be isobilateral. The leaf is an integral part of the stem system, and most leaves are flattened and have distinct upper (adaxial) and lower (abaxial) surfaces that differ in color, hairiness, the number of stomata (pores that intake and output gases), the amount and structure of epicuticular wax, and other features. Leaves are mostly green in color due to the presence of a compound called chlorophyll which is essential for photosynthesis as it absorbs light energy from the Sun. A leaf with lighter-colored or white patches or edges is called a variegated leaf.\nLeaves vary in shape, size, texture and color, depending on the species.

The broad, flat leaves with complex venation of flowering plants are known as megaphylls and the species that bear them (the majority) as broad-leaved or megaphyllous plants, which also include acrogymnosperms and ferns. In the lycopods, with different evolutionary origins, the leaves are simple (with only a single vein) and are known as microphylls. Some leaves, such as bulb scales, are not above ground. In many aquatic species, the leaves are submerged in water. Succulent plants often have thick juicy leaves, but some leaves are without major photosynthetic function and may be dead at maturity, as in some cataphylls and spines. Furthermore, several kinds of leaf-like structures found in vascular plants are not totally homologous with them. Examples include flattened plant stems called phylloclades and cladodes, and flattened leaf stems called phyllodes which differ from leaves both in their structure and origin. Some structures of non-vascular plants look and function much like leaves. Examples include the phyllids of mosses and liverworts.\nGeneral characteristics\nLeaves are the most important organs of most vascular plants.

Green plants are autotrophic, meaning that they do not obtain food from other living things but instead create their own food by photosynthesis. They capture the energy in sunlight and use it to make simple sugars, such as glucose and sucrose, from carbon dioxide (CO2) and water. The sugars are then stored as starch, further processed by chemical synthesis into more complex organic molecules such as proteins or cellulose, the basic structural material in plant cell walls, or metabolized by cellular respiration to provide chemical energy to run cellular processes. The leaves draw water from the ground in the transpiration stream through a vascular conducting system known as xylem and obtain carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by diffusion through openings called stomata in the outer covering layer of the leaf (epidermis), while leaves are orientated to maximize their exposure to sunlight. Once sugar has been synthesized, it needs to be transported to areas of active growth such as the shoots and roots. Vascular plants transport sucrose in a special tissue called the phloem. The phloem and xylem are parallel to each other, but the transport of materials is usually in opposite directions. Within the leaf these vascular systems branch (ramify) to form veins which supply as much of the leaf as possible, ensuring that cells carrying out photosynthesis are close to the transportation system.\nTypically leaves are broad, flat and thin (dorsiventrally flattened",

They are arranged on the plant so as to expose their surfaces to light as efficiently as possible without shading each other, but there are many exceptions and complications. For instance, plants adapted to windy conditions may have pendent leaves, such as in many willows and eucalypts. The flat, or laminar, shape also maximizes thermal contact with the surrounding air, promoting cooling. Functionally, in addition to carrying out photosynthesis, the leaf is the principal site of transpiration, providing the energy required to draw the transpiration stream up from the roots, and guttation.\nMany conifers have thin needle-like or scale-like leaves that can be advantageous in cold climates with frequent snow and frost. These are interpreted as reduced from megaphyllous leaves of their Devonian ancestors. Some leaf forms are adapted to modulate the amount of light they absorb to avoid or mitigate excessive heat, ultraviolet damage, or desiccation, or to sacrifice light-absorption efficiency in favor of protection from herbivory.

Some window plants such as Fenestraria species and some Haworthia species such as Haworthia tesselata and Haworthia truncata are examples of xerophytes.\nLeaves function to store chemical energy and water (especially in succulents) and may become specialized organs serving other functions, such as tendrils of peas and other legumes, the protective spines of cacti, and the insect traps in carnivorous plants such as Nepenthes and Sarracenia. Leaves are the fundamental structural units from which cones are constructed in gymnosperms (each cone scale is a modified megaphyll leaf known as a sporophyll) and from which flowers are constructed in flowering plants.\nThe internal organization of most kinds of leaves has evolved to maximize exposure of the photosynthetic organelles (chloroplasts) to light and to increase the absorption of CO2 while at the same time controlling water loss. Their surfaces are waterproofed by the plant cuticle, and gas exchange between the mesophyll cells and the atmosphere is controlled by minute (length and width measured in tens of μm) stomata which open or close to regulate the rate exchange of CO2, oxygen (",

Stomatal opening is controlled by the turgor pressure in a pair of guard cells that surround the stomatal aperture. In any square centimeter of a plant leaf, there may be from 1,000 to 100,000 stomata.\nThe shape and structure of leaves vary considerably from species to species of plant, depending largely on their adaptation to climate and available light, but also to other factors such as grazing animals, available nutrients, and ecological competition from other plants. Considerable changes in leaf type occur within species, too, for example as a plant matures (Eucalyptus species commonly have isobilateral, pendent leaves when mature and dominating their neighbors; however, such trees tend to have erect or horizontal dorsiventral leaves as seedlings, when their growth is limited by the available light.) Other factors include the need to balance water loss at high temperature and low humidity against the need to absorb CO2.

The concentration of photosynthetic structures in leaves requires that they be richer in protein, minerals, and sugars than, say, woody stem tissues. Accordingly, leaves are prominent in the diet of many animals. Correspondingly, leaves represent heavy investment on the part of the plants bearing them, and their retention or disposition are the subject of elaborate strategies for dealing with pest pressures, seasonal conditions, and protective measures such as the growth of thorns and the production of phytoliths, lignins, tannins and poisons.\nDeciduous plants in cold temperate regions typically shed their leaves in autumn, whereas in areas with a severe dry season, some plants may shed their leaves until the dry season ends. In either case, the shed leaves often contribute their retained nutrients to the soil where they fall. In contrast, many other non-seasonal plants, such as palms and conifers, retain their leaves for long periods; Welwitschia retains its two main leaves throughout a lifetime that may exceed a thousand years.\nThe leaf-like organs of bryophytes (e.g., mosses and liverworts), known as phyllids,",

(The phyllids of the moss family Polytrichaceae are notable exceptions.) The phyllids of bryophytes are only present on the gametophytes, while in contrast the leaves of vascular plants are only present on the sporophytes. These can further develop into either vegetative or reproductive structures.\nSimple, vascularized leaves (microphylls), such as those of the early Devonian lycopsid Baragwanathia, first evolved as enations, extensions of the stem. True leaves or euphylls of larger size and with more complex venation did not become widespread in other groups until the Devonian period, by which time the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere had dropped significantly.

Not every species produces leaves with all of these structural components. The lamina is the expanded, flat component of the leaf which contains the chloroplasts. The sheath is a structure at the base that fully or partially wraps around the stem, above the node where the leaf is attached. Leaf sheathes typically occur in Poaceae (grasses), Apiaceae (umbellifers), and many palms. Between the sheath and the lamina, there may be a pseudopetiole, a petiole like structure.

A petiole may be absent (apetiolate), or the blade may not be laminar (flattened). The petiole mechanically links the leaf to the plant and provides the route for transfer of water and sugars to and from the leaf. The lamina is typically the location of the majority of photosynthesis. The upper (adaxial) angle between a leaf and a stem is known as the axil of the leaf. It is often the location of a bud. Structures located there are called  axillary .\nExternal leaf characteristics, such as shape, margin, hairs, the petiole, and the presence of stipules and glands, are frequently important for identifying plants to family, genus or species levels, and botanists have developed a rich terminology for describing leaf characteristics. Leaves almost always have determinate growth. They grow to a specific pattern and shape and then stop. Other plant parts like stems or roots have non-determinate growth, and will usually continue to grow as long as they have the resources to do so.\nThe type of leaf is usually characteristic of a species (monomorphic), although some species produce more than one type of leaf (dimorphic or polymorphic).

The terminology associated with the description of leaf morphology is presented, in illustrated form, at Wikibooks.\nWhere leaves are basal, and lie on the ground, they are referred to as prostrate.\nBasic leaf types\nPerennial plants whose leaves are shed annually are said to have deciduous leaves, while leaves that remain through winter are evergreens. Leaves attached to stems by stalks (known as petioles) are called petiolate, and if attached directly to the stem with no petiole they are called sessile.\nFerns have fronds.\nConifer leaves are typically needle- or awl-shaped or scale-like; they are usually evergreen but can sometimes be deciduous.

Less commonly, dicot leaf blades may have palmate venation (several large veins diverging from petiole to leaf edges). Finally, some exhibit parallel venation. Monocot leaves in temperate climates usually have narrow blades and usually parallel venation converging at leaf tips or edges.

Each new node is formed at the apex, and it is rotated by a constant angle from the previous node. This angle is called the divergence angle. The number of leaves that grow from a node depends on the plant species. When a single leaf grows from each node, and when the stem is held straight, the leaves form a helix.\nThe divergence angle is often represented as a fraction of a full rotation around the stem. A rotation fraction of 1 2 (a divergence angle of 180 ) produces an alternate arrangement, such as in Gasteria or the fan-aloe Kumara plicatilis. Rotation fractions of 1 3 (divergence angles of 120 ) occur in beech and hazel. Oak and apricot rotate by 2 5, sunflowers, poplar, and pear by 3 8, and in willow and almond the fraction is 5 13. These arrangements are periodic. The denominator of the rotation fraction indicates the number of leaves in one period, while the numerator indicates the number of complete turns or gyres made in one period.

The ratio between successive Fibonacci numbers tends to the golden ratio φ   (1    5) 2.

If the nodes do not rotate (a rotation fraction of zero and a divergence angle of 0 ), the two helices become a pair of parallel lines, creating a distichous arrangement as in maple or olive trees. More common in a decussate pattern, in which each node rotates by 1 4 (90 ) as in the herb basil. The leaves of tricussate plants such as Nerium oleander form a triple helix. The leaves of some plants do not form helices. In some plants, the divergence angle changes as the plant grows. In orixate phyllotaxis, named after Orixa japonica, the divergence angle is not constant. Instead, it is periodic and follows the sequence 180 , 90 , 180 , 270 .\nDivisions of the blade\nTwo basic forms of leaves can be described considering the way the blade (lamina) is divided. A simple leaf has an undivided blade. However, the leaf may be dissected to form lobes, but the gaps between lobes do not reach to the main vein. A compound leaf has a fully subdivided blade, each leaflet of the blade being separated along a main or secondary vein.

The veins in a leaf represent the vascular structure of the organ, extending into the leaf via the petiole and providing transportation of water and nutrients between leaf and stem, and play a crucial role in the maintenance of leaf water status and photosynthetic capacity. They also play a role in the mechanical support of the leaf. Within the lamina of the leaf, while some vascular plants possess only a single vein, in most this vasculature generally divides (ramifies) according to a variety of patterns (venation) and form cylindrical bundles, usually lying in the median plane of the mesophyll, between the two layers of epidermis. This pattern is often specific to taxa, and of which angiosperms possess two main types, parallel and reticulate (net like). In general, parallel ven",

In general, parallel venation is typical of monocots, while reticulate is more typical of eudicots and magnoliids ( dicots ), though there are many exceptions.\nThe vein or veins entering the leaf from the petiole are called primary or first-order veins. The veins branching from these are secondary or second-order veins. These primary and secondary veins are considered major veins or lower order veins, though some authors include third order. Each subsequent branching is sequentially numbered, and these are the higher order veins, each branching being associated with a narrower vein diameter. \nIn parallel veined leaves, the primary veins run parallel and equidistant to each other for most of the length of the leaf and then converge or fuse (anastomose) towards the apex. Usually, many smaller minor veins interconnect these primary veins but may terminate with very fine vein endings in the mesophyll.

The secondary veins, also known as second order veins or lateral veins, branch off from the midrib and extend toward the leaf margins. These often terminate in a hydathode, a secretory organ, at the margin. In turn, smaller veins branch from the secondary veins, known as tertiary or third order (or higher order) veins, forming a dense reticulate pattern. The areas or islands of mesophyll lying between the higher order veins, are called areoles. Some of the smallest veins (veinlets) may have their endings in the areoles, a process known as areolation. These minor veins act as the sites of exchange between the mesophyll and the plant's vascular system. Thus, minor veins collect the products of photosynthesis (photosynthate) from the cells where it takes place, while major veins are responsible for its transport outside of the leaf. At the same time water is being transported in the opposite direction.\nThe number of vein endings is variable, as is whether second order veins end at the margin, or link back to other veins.

Within these the major veins function as the support and distribution network for leaves and are correlated with leaf shape. For instance, the parallel venation found in most monocots correlates with their elongated leaf shape and wide leaf base, while reticulate venation is seen in simple entire leaves, while digitate leaves typically have venation in which three or more primary veins diverge radially from a single point.\nIn evolutionary terms, early emerging taxa tend to have dichotomous branching with reticulate systems emerging later. Veins appeared in the Permian, prior to the appearance of angiosperms in the Triassic, during which vein hierarchy appeared enabling higher function, larger leaf size and adaption to a wider variety of climatic conditions.

It is covered with a waxy cuticle which is impermeable to liquid water and water vapor and forms the boundary separating the plant's inner cells from the external world. The cuticle is in some cases thinner on the lower epidermis than on the upper epidermis, and is generally thicker on leaves from dry climates as compared with those from wet climates. The epidermis serves several functions: protection against water loss by way of transpiration, regulation of gas exchange and secretion of metabolic compounds. Most leaves show dorsoventral anatomy: The upper (adaxial) and lower (abaxial) surfaces have somewhat different construction and may serve different functions.\nThe epidermis tissue includes several differentiated cell types; epidermal cells, epidermal hair cells (trichomes), cells in the stomatal complex; guard cells and subsidiary cells.

The opening and closing of the stomatal aperture is controlled by the stomatal complex and regulates the exchange of gases and water vapor between the outside air and the interior of the leaf. Stomata therefore play the important role in allowing photosynthesis without letting the leaf dry out.

The cells of the spongy layer are more branched and not so tightly packed, so that there are large intercellular air spaces between them. The pores or stomata of the epidermis open into substomatal chambers, which are connected to the intercellular air spaces between the spongy and palisade mesophyll cell, so that oxygen, carbon dioxide and water vapor can diffuse into and out of the leaf and access the mesophyll cells during respiration, photosynthesis and transpiration.\nLeaves are normally green, due to",

Some plants have leaves of different colors due to the presence of accessory pigments such as carotenoids in their mesophyll cells.\nVascular tissue\nThe veins are the vascular tissue of the leaf and are located in the spongy layer of the mesophyll. The pattern of the veins is called venation. In angiosperms the venation is typically parallel in monocotyledons and forms an interconnecting network in broad-leaved plants. They were once thought to be typical examples of pattern formation through ramification, but they may instead exemplify a pattern formed in a stress tensor field.\nA vein is made up of a vascular bundle. At the core of each bundle are clusters of two\ndistinct types of conducting cells:\nXylem\nCells that bring water and minerals from the roots into the leaf.\nPhloem\nCells that usually move sap, with dissolved sucrose (glucose to sucrose) produced by photosynthesis in the leaf, out of the leaf.\nThe xylem typically lies on the adaxial side of the vascular bundle and the phloem typically lies on the abaxial side.

Both are embedded in a dense parenchyma tissue, called the sheath, which usually includes some structural collenchyma tissue.\nLeaf development\nAccording to Agnes Arber's partial-shoot theory of the leaf, leaves are partial shoots, being derived from leaf primordia of the shoot apex. Early in development they are dorsiventrally flattened with both dorsal and ventral surfaces. Compound leaves are closer to shoots than simple leaves. Developmental studies have shown that compound leaves, like shoots, may branch in three dimensions. On the basis of molecular genetics, Eckardt and Baum (2010) concluded that  it is now generally accepted that compound leaves express both leaf and shoot properties.  Many dicotyledonous leaves show endogenously driven daily rhythmicity in growth.\nEcology\nBiomechanics\nPlants respond and adapt to environmental factors, such as light and mechanical stress from wind. Leaves need to support their own mass and align themselves in such a way as to optimize their exposure to the sun, generally more or less horizontally. However, horizontal alignment maximizes exposure to bending forces and failure from stresses such as wind, snow, hail, falling debris, animals, and abrasion from surrounding foliage and plant structures.

However, horizontal alignment maximizes exposure to bending forces and failure from stresses such as wind, snow, hail, falling debris, animals, and abrasion from surrounding foliage and plant structures. Overall leaves are relatively flimsy with regard to other plant structures such as stems, branches and roots.\nBoth leaf blade and petiole structure influence the leaf's response to forces such as wind, allowing a degree of repositioning to minimize drag and damage, as opposed to resistance. Leaf movement like this may also increase turbulence of the air close to the surface of the leaf, which thins the boundary layer of air immediately adjacent to the surface, increasing the capacity for gas and heat exchange, as well as photosynthesis. Strong wind forces may result in diminished leaf number and surface area, which while reducing drag, involves a trade off of also reducing photosynthesis. Thus, leaf design may involve compromise between carbon gain, thermoregulation and water loss on the one hand, and the cost of sustaining both static and dynamic loads. In vascular plants, perpendicular forces are spread over a larger area and are relatively flexible in both bending and torsion, enabling elastic deforming without damage.\nMany leaves rely on hydrostatic support arranged around a skeleton of vascular tissue for their strength, which depends on maintaining leaf water status. Both the mechanics and architecture of the leaf reflect the need for transportation and support. Read and Stokes (2006) consider two basic models",

Both the mechanics and architecture of the leaf reflect the need for transportation and support. Read and Stokes (2006) consider two basic models, the  hydrostatic  and  I-beam leaf  form (see Fig 1). Hydrostatic leaves such as in Prostanthera lasianthos are large and thin, and may involve the need for multiple leaves rather single large leaves because of the amount of veins needed to support the periphery of large leaves. But large leaf size favors efficiency in photosynthesis and water conservation, involving further trade offs. On the other hand, I-beam leaves such as Banksia marginata involve specialized structures to stiffen them. These I-beams are formed from bundle sheath extensions of sclerenchyma meeting stiffened sub-epidermal layers. This shifts the balance from reliance on hydrostatic pressure to structural support, an obvious advantage where water is relatively scarce.\n Long narrow leaves bend more easily than ovate leaf blades of the same area. Monocots typically have such linear leaves that maximize surface area while minimizing self-shading. In these a high proportion of longitudinal main veins provide additional support.\nInteractions with other organisms\nAlthough not as nutritious as other organs such as fruit, leaves provide a food source for many organisms.

The leaf is a vital source of energy production for the plant, and plants have evolved protection against animals that consume leaves, such as tannins, chemicals which hinder the digestion of proteins and have an unpleasant taste. Animals that are specialized to eat leaves are known as folivores.\nSome species have cryptic adaptations by which they use leaves in avoiding predators. For example, the caterpillars of some leaf-roller moths will create a small home in the leaf by folding it over themselves. Several other lepidopteran larvae modify leaves for shelter; perhaps the greatest variety of shelter types occurs among the skipper butterflies (Hesperiidae), which will cut, fold, and bind leaves using silk. Some sawflies similarly roll the leaves of their food plants into tubes. Females of the Attelabidae, so-called leaf-rolling weevils, lay their eggs into leaves that they then roll up as means of protection. Other herbivores and their predators mimic the appearance of the leaf.

This mechanism to shed leaves is called abscission. When the leaf is shed, it leaves a leaf scar on the twig. In cold autumns, they sometimes change color, and turn yellow, bright-orange, or red, as various accessory pigments (carotenoids and xanthophylls) are revealed when the tree responds to cold and reduced sunlight by curtailing chlorophyll production. Red anthocyanin pigments are now thought to be produced in the leaf as it dies, possibly to mask the yellow hue left when the chlorophyll is lost yellow leaves appear to attract herbivores such as aphids. Optical masking of chlorophyll by anthocyanins reduces risk of photo-oxidative damage to leaf cells as they senesce, which otherwise may lower the efficiency of nutrient retrieval from senescing autumn leaves.\nEvolutionary adaptation\nIn the course of evolution, leaves have adapted to different environments in the following ways:\nWaxy micro- and nanostructures on the surface reduce wetting by rain and adhesion of contamination (See Lotus effect).\nDivided and compound leaves reduce wind",

It is a ten digit number that is widely used in Sweden to identify individuals.\nHistory\nWhen it was introduced in 1947 it was probably the first of its kind covering the total resident population of a country (the Social Security number in the United States is older by 12 years, but it did not originally cover the whole population). Numbers are issued by the Swedish Tax Agency (Swedish: Skatteverket) as part of the population register (Swedish: Folkbokföring). Until 1967, it had nine digits, and after that 10 digits. This was expanded to 12 digits in 1997 in cases of automated data treatment.\nUse\nThe number is used by authorities, by health care, schools and universities (both public-run and private). Also used by banks (needing it by law for tax purposes and mandatory customer identification) and insurance companies (needing it for car liability insurance and for medical travel insurance coordination). Other companies often ask for it in return for a post-paid service, such as a telephone subscription, to be able to check e.g. the person's credit record or address or if needed to perform debt collection.\nThe link between a person and the identity number is established through the civil registry and through identity documents and secondarily through the widespread use of the number in various contacts with authorities, businesses etc. They are necessary for personal service",

Most people are familiar with their full number and those of their children without hesitation. Personal identity numbers of individuals are openly available from the Swedish tax authorities to anyone who asks (over the phone, letter, over the desk, but not over the internet), according to the Swedish principle of freedom of information. Redistribution of these numbers using computers is, however, governed by the law of personal details, in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\nFormat\nThe personal identity number consists of 10 digits and a hyphen. The first 6 or 8 digits correspond to the person's birthday, in YYMMDD. For automated data treatment the format for the date of birth is typically eight digits, YYYYMMDD. In case the specific day is out of birth numbers, another day (close to the correct one) is used. They are followed by a hyphen, and four final digits. The year a person turns 100 the hyphen is replaced with a plus sign. Among the four last digits, the three first are a serial number.

For the last digit among these three, an odd number is assigned to males and an even number to females.\nUp to 1990, the assignment of serial number was correlated with the county where the bearer of the number was born or (if born before 1947) where he she had been living, according to tax records, on 1 January 1947, with a special code (usually 9 as 7th digit) for immigrants. Since people rarely change identity number people assigned identity number before 1990 can still have their birth county or immigration identified.\nThe last digit is a checksum which was introduced in 1967 when the system was computerized. Originally, when the personal identity number was introduced, it had nine digits and the seventh and eighth denoted the county (Swedish: län) in which the subject was born or had been living in 1947 - see above. The seventh digit was 9 for foreign born. This system was replaced with the current system in 1990. Everyone however keeps their number and it is not hard to find out someone's number if you know the birth date, the birth county and the checksum algorithm.

Even easier is to call the tax authority and ask, since the personal identity number is public information.\nWith citizens and other persons born in Sweden, the identity number is issued soon after the birth of a child has been reported by the parents and medical professionals. In exceptional cases, the number may be changed later in life, typically because the date of birth or the registration of gender of the child were in error. If a person changes their legal gender, they will be issued a new identity number as well to reflect their new legal gender. Changes in the records of who were someone's biological parents do not affect the number, which has nothing to do with family circumstances.\nA review on the Swedish Personal Identity Number was published in 2009 by medical researchers and representatives of the Tax authority, Statistics Sweden and the National Board of Health and Welfare.\nIn February 2007, the Swedish Tax Agency highlighted a problem that the identity numbers were going to run out for certain dates, mainly the 1st of some months, which have been used in birth certificates in some countries where births often have not been properly registered.

It is issued by the Tax Agency at the request of a public agency. It is used for contact between a person and an agency which would otherwise require the use of a personal identity number, for example for people have their main residence less than a year in the country or don't reside at all but needs authority contacts, e.g. owning a summer house, or for Swedish citizens who have never been residents of Sweden. It is structured along the same lines, but with the day in the date of birth advanced by 60 (giving a number between 61 and 91). The reason for this routine is that there is a risk of running out of personal identity numbers. For EU EEA citizens, is easier to get a co-ordination number than a personal identity number because the latter require evidence of work or education which would last at least a year, so many students or workers get a co-ordination number first and later a personal identity number.

In August 1959, the line was again regauged, this time to 1,435 mm (4 ft 8 1 2 in) to match the standard gauge used by Keisei Electric Railway.\nIn June 2014, the company unveiled a new corporate image with a new corporate logo and  gentle pink  corporate colour scheme and train livery. The company's entire fleet of trains was scheduled to be reliveried in the new colour scheme, with the first train, an 8800 series set entering service from 29 August 2014.\nMerger with Keisei Electric Railway\nIn an announcement made on 31 October 2023, Shin-Keisei Electric Railway revealed that it would be merged into the parent Keisei Electric Railway. The acquisition was completed on 1 April 2025, and the line was renamed as the Keisei Matsudo Line. The merger also resulted in the bus company subsidiaries being acquired by parent company, Keisei Electric Railway.\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website (in Japanese)\nOfficial website (in English)",

    "text": "The Thomas Street Distillery was an Irish whiskey distillery located in Dublin, Ireland. At its peak, it was Dublin's largest and most productive distillery and with an output of over 2 million gallons per annum, twice that of John Jameson's acclaimed nearby Bow Street distillery. \nAlfred Barnard, a British author who visited most of the distilleries in the then United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in the late 1880s, wrote that, at the time of his visit, the Thomas Street Distillery may have been the largest whiskey distillery in the world and probably had the highest output of any whiskey distillery in the British Isles. However, the distillery later entered into financial difficulties, and closed in 1926. Although most of the distillery buildings were demolished following its closure, a few were incorporated into the Guinness St. James's Gate Brewery and are still extant.\nIn January 2017, Diageo, producers of Guinness, announced that they would invest  25 million in establishing a new distillery in the old brewery power house building on Thomas Street, close to the site of the original Thomas Street Distillery. Production at the new distillery started in the first half of 2019. In addition, Diageo resurrected the original brand and launched a non-chill filtered, 45  ABV premium blended whiskey under the name  Roe   Co  in March 2017.\nHistory\nIn 1757",

In addition, Diageo resurrected the original brand and launched a non-chill filtered, 45  ABV premium blended whiskey under the name  Roe   Co  in March 2017.\nHistory\nIn 1757, Peter Roe purchased a small existing distillery on Thomas Street in Dublin. The premises were gradually expanded with rising trade, until the distillery fronted South Earl Street. Richard Roe continued operations at Thomas Street from 1766 to 1794. However, the distilling laws in the then Kingdom of Ireland limited any serious chance of expansion. In 1782, he was operating a still with a capacity of 234 gallons.\nIn 1784, another member of the Roe family, Nicolas Roe, set up a distillery in Pimlico. This distillery was a larger operation, and was recorded as having a still of 1,165 gallon capacity in 1802, which was replaced by an even larger 1,575 gallon still by 1807. By 1832, George Roe had inherited both of these plants which were near to each other, and expanded them. In addition, he leased additional premises in Mount Brown, which were used as maltings, kilns, and warehouses. By 1827, output of the Thomas Street Distillery was reported as being 244,279 gallons. George Roe's two nephews, Henry and George (which some accounts erroneously refer to as his sons), succeeded",

George Roe's two nephews, Henry and George (which some accounts erroneously refer to as his sons), succeeded to the ownership in 1862, by which point the firm was large and prosperous, and the Roes a family of wealth and influence. So much so that in 1878, the Roes could afford to donate  250,000, a very large sum in those days, to the restoration of Christ Church Cathedral in Dublin, and were knighted for their efforts.\nWhen Alfred Barnard, the British historian, visited the plant, it was at its zenith, and he described it as being one of the largest and best equipped in the world, occupying 17 acres, with eight pot stills in operation, an output of over 2 million gallons per annum, and a payroll of over 200 staff, including 18 coopers. At the time, its largest export market was across to Great Britain; however, Canada, the United States, and Australia also represented important export markets.\nHowever, by 1891, the distillery was beginning to feel the impact of competition from Scottish distillers, and the company was amalgamated with two other Dublin distilling companies, the Dublin Whiskey Distillery Company's Jones Road Distillery, and William Jameson's Marrowbone Lane Distillery (not to be confused",

However, following the loss of both the American and British Commonwealth export markets during prohibition and the Anglo-Irish trade war in the 1920s, the company suffered severe financial difficulties, and both the Thomas Street and Marrowbone Lane distilleries closed in 1923, with the Jones Road Distillery following suit in 1926, though distilling may have continued at Jones Road until 1946.\nFollowing its closure, many of the buildings were demolished in stages. However, a portion of the site was purchased by the neighbouring Guinness Brewery at St. James's Gate, and some of the buildings are still in existence, including the landmark St. Patrick's Tower.\nDuring the 1916 Easter Rising, both Roe's Distillery and the nearby Jameson Distillery at Marrowbone Lane were used as outposts by the Irish rebels.\nSt Patrick's Tower\nConstructed in 1757, the year Peter Roe purchased the small distillery on Thomas Street, St. Patrick's Tower is a 150 ft high brick-built windmill which is believed to be one of the oldest extant smock windmills in Europe.

Its pilot episode in 2017 got 20.1 , 5.7  higher than rival show Wowowin. The show peaked in its October 10, 2017, episode with a 35.2  nationwide rating, placing it only behind ABS-CBN's TV Patrol and FPJ's Ang Probinsyano that same night as the country's most watched TV broadcast. The same figure also ranked Wildflower as the country's highest-rated TV show on the pre-primetime slot since the Philippines switched to nationwide TV ratings system in 2009.\nThe show ended in 2018 notching a final nationwide rating of 24.3  in its finale.\nAccolades\nSee also\nThe Killer Bride (another series starring Maja Salvador)\nLavender Fields (similar storyline series, released 2024-25)\nList of programs broadcast by ABS-CBN\nList of ABS-CBN Studios original drama series\nList of programs broadcast by Jeepney TV\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\nWildflower at (similar storyline series, released 2024-25)\nList of programs broadcast by ABS-CBN\nList of ABS-CBN Studios original drama series\nList of programs broadcast by Jeepney TV\nNotes\nReferences\nExternal links\nWildflower at IMDb\nWildflower on Netflix",

    "text": "There are disputes between China, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea over the extent of their respective exclusive economic zones (EEZs) in the East China Sea.\nThe dispute between the People's Republic of China (PRC) and Japan concerns the different application of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which both nations have ratified. China proposed the application of UNCLOS, considering the natural prolongation of its continental shelf, advocating that the EEZ extends as far as the Okinawa Trough. Its Ministry of Foreign Affairs has stated that  the natural prolongation of the continental shelf of China in the East China Sea extends to the Okinawa Trough and beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea of China is measured,  which is applicable to the relevant UNCLOS provisions that support China's right to the natural shelf.\nIn 2012, China presented a submission under the UNCLOS concerning the outer limits of the continental shelf to the UN. Japan, based on UNCLOS, proposed the Median line division of the EEZ.\nUnder the United Nations' Law of the Sea, the PRC claims the disputed ocean territory as its own Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) due to its being part of PRC's natural extension of its continental shelf, while Japan claims the disputed ocean territory as its own EEZ because it is within 200 nautical miles (370 km) from Japan's coast",

About 40,000 square kilometres (15,000 square miles) of EEZ are in dispute. China and Japan both claim 200 nautical miles (370 km; 230 mi) of EEZ rights, but the East China Sea width is only 360 nautical miles (670 km; 410 mi). China claims an EEZ extending to the eastern end of the Chinese continental shelf (based on UNCLOS III) which goes deep into the Japanese's claimed EEZ.\nIn 1995, the People's Republic of China (PRC) discovered an undersea natural gas field in the East China Sea, namely the Chunxiao gas field, which lies within the Chinese EEZ while Japan believes it is connected to other possible reserves beyond the median line. Japan has objected to PRC development of natural gas resources in the East China Sea near an area where the two countries Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) claims overlap.

The specific development in dispute is the PRC's drilling in the Chunxiao gas field, which is located in undisputed areas on China's side, three or four miles (6 km) west of the median line proposed by Japan. Japan maintains that although the Chunxiao gas field rigs are on the PRC side of a median line that Tokyo regards as the two sides' sea boundary, they may tap into a field that stretches underground into the disputed area. Japan therefore seeks a share in the natural gas resources. The gas fields in the Xihu Sag area in the East China Sea (Canxue, Baoyunting, Chunxiao, Duanqiao, Wuyunting, and Tianwaitian) are estimated to hold proven reserves of 364 BCF of natural gas. Commercial operations began 2006. In June 2008, both sides agreed to jointly develop the Chunxiao gas fields.\nRounds of disputes about island ownership in the East China Sea have triggered both official and civilian protests between China and Japan.\nThe dispute between PRC and South Korea concerns Socotra Rock, a submerged reef on which South Korea has constructed a scientific research station. While neither country claims the rock as territory, the PRC has objected to Korean activities there as a breach of its EEZ rights.\nSouth Korea opened a museum in central Seoul in 2012 to back its claim to the Liancourt Rocks.

Tradition holds that he lived sometime between 2294 BC and 2184 BC. Tradition also holds that those with the surname Hu (胡) are descendants of Emperor Shun. Subsequent rulers of the Chen state and the Chen dynasty claimed descent from Shun.\nNames\nShun's clan name (姓) is Yao (姚), his lineage name (氏) is Youyu (有虞). His given name was Chonghua (重華). Shun is sometimes referred to as the Great Shun (大舜) or as Yu Shun or Shun of Yu (虞舜),  Yu  being the name of his fief, which he received from Yao.\nLife of Shun\nAccording to traditional sources, Shun received the mantle of leadership from Emperor Yao at the age of 53, and then died at the age of 100 years. Before his death Shun is recorded as relinquishing his seat of power to Yu (禹), the founder of the Xia dynasty.

Yao was so impressed that he appointed Shun as his successor to the throne. Shun wished to decline in favour of someone more virtuous, but eventually assumed Yao's duties. It was said that  those who had to try a lawsuit did not go to Danzhu, but to Shun.  Danzhu was the son of Yao.\nAfter ascending to the throne, Shun offered sacrifices to the god Shang Di (上帝), as well as to the hills, rivers, and the host of spirits (神). Then he toured the eastern, the southern, the western, and the northern parts of the country; in each place he offered burnt-offering to Heaven at each of the four peaks (Mount Tai, Mount Huang, Mount Hua and Mount Heng), sacrificed to the hills and rivers, set in accord the seasons, months, and days, established uniform measurements of length and capacities, and reinforced ceremonial laws.\nShun divided the land into twelve provinces, raising altars upon twelve hills, and deepening the rivers.

Both sources agree that after abdicating, Yao lived for another 28 years in retirement during Shun's reign.\nIn later centuries, Yao and Shun were glorified for their virtue by Confucian philosophers. Shun was particularly renowned for his modesty and filial piety (xiao 孝).\nLegends\nSima Qian claimed in Annals of the Five Emperors (五帝本紀) that Shun descended from the Yellow Emperor through the latter's grandson Emperor Zhuanxu. The Bamboo Annals (048) recorded the name of Shun's mother as Wodeng (握登), and Shun's birthplace as Yaoxu (姚墟). Wodeng died when Shun was very young.

Yao asked his ministers, the Four Mountains, to propose a suitable successor. Yao then heard of Shun's tales. Wise Yao did not want to simply believe in the tales about Shun, so he decided to test Shun. Yao gave a district to Shun to govern and married his two daughters to him, with a small dowry of a new house and some money.\nThough given an office and money, Shun still lived humbly.

Another time, Xiang and his mother conspired to get Shun drunk and then throw him into a dried-up well and then bury him with rocks and dirt.

Shun pretended to get drunk, and when he was thrown into the well, he had already a tunnel pre-dug to escape to the surface. Thus, Shun survived many attempts on his life. Yet, he never blamed his stepmother or his half brother, and forgave them every time.\nEventually, Shun's stepmother and half brother repented their past wrongs.

His father Li Maoxun had been a Uyghur of the Abusi (阿布思) tribe. The tribe had been subdued during the 840s by the Lulong military governor Zhang Zhongwu and members of its nobility including Li Maoxun had been obliged to take Chinese names (including the imperial clan's surname Li) and to live in Lulong, working with its military to pacify the northern border of the Tang Empire. In 875, Li Maoxun overthrew the military governor Zhang Gongsu in a mutiny and took control of the region. He was subsequently confirmed by Emperor Xizong as the new military governor. The next year, Li Maoxun requested retirement from the post, recommending his son to succeed him. The emperor allowed the retirement, named Li Keju the acting military governor, and subsequently formally commissioned him as the full military governor later in the year.\nLi Keyong's rebellion\nIn 878, the sinicized Shatuo officer Li Keyong rebelled and seized Datong and its hinterland",

Both Li Keju and Wang Rong, the military governor of Chengde (成德) around modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei, were fearful of Li Keyong's growing strength and therefore made a pact to conquer Yiwu and divide its territory between them. They also persuaded Helian to attack Li Keyong, keeping him occupied during their invasion. \nThey launched their attack in the spring of 885, with Li Keju's officer Li Quanzhong attacking Yiwu's Yi Prefecture with 60,000 men and Wang Rong attacking Wuji (無極) within modern Shijiazhuang. Li Quanzhong's subordinate Liu Rengong was able to capture Yizhou, the capital of Yi Prefecture, by digging a tunnel past its walls.

It was absorbed into Conrail in April 1976 along with several other prominent bankrupt railroads of the Northeastern United States.\nThe CNJ's main line had a major presence in New Jersey. Most of the main line is now used by the Raritan Valley Line passenger service. CNJ main line trackage in Phillipsburg, New Jersey became part of the Lehigh Line under Conrail.\nHistory\n19th century\nThe earliest railroad ancestor of the CNJ was the Elizabethtown   Somerville Railroad, incorporated in 1831 and opened from Elizabethport to Elizabeth, New Jersey, in 1836. Horses gave way to steam in 1839, and the railroad was extended west, reaching Somerville at the beginning of 1842. The Somerville and Easton Railroad was incorporated in 1847 and began building westward. \nIn 1849, it purchased the Elizabethtown   Somerville and adopted a new name: Central Railroad Company of New Jersey.

It was extended east across Newark Bay to Jersey City in 1864, and it gradually acquired branches to Flemington, Newark, Perth Amboy, Chester, and Wharton.\nThe New Jersey Southern (NJS) began construction in 1860 at Port Monmouth. The railroad worked its way southwest across lower New Jersey and reached Bayside, New Jersey, on the Delaware River west of Bridgeton, New Jersey in 1871. The NJS came under control of the CNJ in 1879. CNJ's influence briefly extended across the Delaware River in the form of the Baltimore   Delaware Bay Railroad, from Bombay Hook, Delaware, east of Townsend, to Chestertown, Maryland. That line became part of the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) family in 1901.\nCNJ's lines in Pennsylvania were built by the Lehigh Coal   Navigation Company as the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad (L S). The main line was completed between Phillipsburg, New Jersey, and Wilkes-Barre in 1866. A notable feature of the line was the Ashley Planes, a steep stretch of line (maximum grade was 14.65 ) operated by cables driven by stationary engines, which would remain in service until after World War II.

The line was extended to Scranton in 1888 by a subsidiary of the L S, the Wilkes-Barre   Scranton; L S leased the line upon completion and assigned the lease to the CNJ. The bulk of the traffic on the Pennsylvania lines was anthracite coal, much of it produced by subsidiaries of the railroad, until the Commodities Clause of the Interstate Commerce Act of 1920 forbade railroads to haul freight in which they had an interest.\nFrom 1883 to 1887, the CNJ was leased to and operated by the Philadelphia   Reading Railroad, with which it formed a New York-Philadelphia route. CNJ resumed its own management after reorganization in 1887.\nThe primary rolling stock repair shops were located in Elizabethport, New Jersey, along Trumbull Avenue. In 1901, the original shops were razed. New, concrete shops took their place, capable of servicing 430 locomotives and 20,000 freight cars annually.

It was painted blue from the pilot of its 4-6-2 to the rear bulkhead of its observation car, and its refurbished cars offered a level of comfort much higher than the usual day coach of the era. The train was the forerunner of the coach streamliners that blossomed nationwide in the late 1930s and the 1940s. It succumbed to automobile competition in 1941. Also in 1929 CNJ purchased a 30 percent interest in the Raritan River Railroad, a 12-mile (19 km) short line from South Amboy to New Brunswick.

Three-fourths of CNJ's freight traffic terminated on line; the railroad was essentially a terminal carrier, which meant little if any profit. In addition, taxes levied by the state of New Jersey ate up much of CNJ's revenue. \nIn 1946, the lines in Pennsylvania were organized as the Central Railroad of Pennsylvania (CRP) in an effort to escape taxation by the state of New Jersey. CNJ resumed its own operation of the Pennsylvania lines at the end of 1952. The CRP continued in existence as owner of the Easton   Western, four miles of track in Easton, Pennsylvania.\nThe merger between the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway and Norfolk and Western Railway proposed in 1965 sought to counter the impending PRR merger with New York Central Railroad merger was to have included CNJ, but the bankruptcy of Penn Central Transportation Company killed that prospect.

Three car bombs were detonated, severely wounding the mayors of Nablus and Ramallah.\nBackground and prelude\nBackground\nFollowing the Six-Day War in 1967, the state of Israel began an occupation of the Palestinian West Bank. As part of the occupation, the Israeli government encouraged the establishment of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, in contravention of international law. In 1976, municipal elections were held throughout the West Bank, with the Israeli occupation authority hoping to calm unrest. However, Palestinian nationalist supporters of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) won most contests.\nPrelude\nOn 2 May 1980, the 1980 Hebron attack occurred, where a group of yeshiva students in their early-20s were ambushed by Fatah militants as they returned from a prayer service at the Cave of the Patriarchs. Six were killed and twenty injured, in what was one of the worst attacks in the West Bank since the start of the Israeli occupation in 1967. Following the attack, the Israeli occupation authority would expel two Palestinian nationalist city mayors in the West Bank, Fahd Qawasmeh of Hebron and Mohammed Milhim of Halhul, and would exile them from Palestine, accusing them of having incited the attack.

The United Nations Security Council would unanimously pass a resolution condemning the expulsions as illegal, with only the United States abstaining. The attack and the subsequent expulsions significantly raised tensions in the West Bank.\nHistory\nBombings\nOn 2 June 1980, a series of car bombs exploded simultaneously in the West Bank. Mayor of Nablus Bassam Shakaa and Mayor of Ramallah Karim Khalaf were both seriously injured by the bombs, with Khalaf losing a leg and Shakaa losing both of his legs.\nAnother bomb targeted an Arab school in Hebron, wounding seven. After the Israeli occupation authority ordered that the cars of all West Banks mayors be inspected, an Israeli Druze police officer named Suleiman Hirbawi was permanently blinded attempting to defuse a fourth bomb targeting the mayor of Al-Bireh.\nInvestigations\nOn 5 June, an aide to far-right rabbi and politician Meir Kahane was detained by Israeli police for questioning over the bombings.

That same day, at the 100th anniversary conference of the World ORT, Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin stated that Israeli should not be pressed to find the perpetrators of the bombings quickly, saying that it might take time.\nIn August 1980, American newspaper The Washington Star would publish an article claiming that Begin had attempted to obstruct the investigation into the bombings. The Shin Bet director denied that the allegations, as did Begin himself. Attorney General of Israel Yitzhak Zamir would subsequently open an investigation into the author of the article, an Israeli journalist, for violation of Israeli military censorship laws. Ratz MK Shulamit Aloni also alleged that the Israeli government interfered with the investigations, telling American journalist Robert I. Friedman that a list of potential suspects linked to far-right movements uncovered by Israeli journalist Danny Rubinstein had been given to the government,  but the government never wanted to do anything about it. \nFormer deputy mayor of the Israeli settlement Kiryat Arba Zeev Friedman and the settlement's former security chief Moshe Rosenthal were arrested in early 1983 on charges of destroying evidence linked to the bombings. In 1982, explosives had been discovered wrapped in newspapers from the date of the attack and concealed in Kiryat Arba, and Friedman and Rosenthal had destroyed the explosives instead of submitting them to the Israeli police.

Major Shlomo Livyatan was charged with having planted car bombs and Captain Aharon Gilla was charged with having led the mayor of Al-Bireh to the car that he knew had been rigged. Gilla claimed that he was unaware that a bomb had been planted, and claimed that he would not have entered the garage where the car was with Hirbawi if he had known there was a bomb. Hirbawi claimed that Gilla had not in fact entered the garage with him and had instead remained in a jeep outside.\nIsraeli police named two other suspects in the case, Yossi Indore and Ira Rappaport. Indore, a settler from Ofra, was suspected of being on the run within Israel, while Rappaport, an American-Israeli settler, was known to be in the United States at the time the arrest warrant was issued.

He immigrated permanently to Israel in 1971, and was recruited into the Jewish Underground by Yehuda Etzion, his brother-in-law. In December 1986, Rappaport voluntarily surrendered to Israeli police at Ben Gurion Airport. He was subsequently convicted for involvement in the bombings on charges of aggravated assault and belonging to a terrorist organisation, and sentenced to 30 months incarceration. After being sentenced, Rappaport stated that imprisonment was  what's called suffering for the love of Israel  and justified the bombings as necessary for law and order, saying that they  led without a doubt to a very, very peaceful time for the next year and a half. \nReactions\nIn Israel\nIsraeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin described the bombings as  crimes of the worst kind.  Begin, however, rejected calls to disarm the fundamentalist pro-settler Gush Emunim movement. Mayor of Jerusalem Teddy Kollek accused Begin of  philosophically  supporting the bombings, saying that  although the government is very much opposed to this, you have their philosophical support, therefore you cannot divorce it from the actions.

Bertram Gold of the American Jewish Committee condemned the attack and stated that  the tragic cycle of violence will truly be broken only when the PLO and its supporters in the Arab world renounce terrorism, and the neighboring Arab states come forward to negotiate genuine peace with Israel. \nOn 5 June, the United Nations Security Council unanimosly passed a motion condemning the bombings as  assassination attempts  and accused Israel of failing  to provide adequate protection to the civilian population in the occupied territories.  The United States abstained from voting on the motion. In response, the Israeli government accused the Security Council of wanting Israel to withdraw from the West Bank and of failing to condemn terrorist attacks on Israelis.

The Type 3 Ho-Ni III superseded the Type 1 Ho-Ni I and its variant the Type 1 Ho-Ni II in production, and gave better protection to the crew by having a completely enclosed superstructure. It was also meant to replace the Type 2 Ho-I for fire support.\nHistory and development\nPrevious gun tanks, Type 1 Ho-Ni I and Type 2 Ho-I, were not really optimized designs. Type 1 Ho-Ni I and Type 1 Ho-Ni II both used an open casemate with frontal and side armour only for the main gun, which made the crew vulnerable in close combat situations. The Type 2 Ho-I, despite its enclosed rotating turret, was armed with a low-velocity howitzer more suitable against gun emplacements and fortifications. The fully enclosed and armored casemate of the Type 3 Ho-Ni III with the more powerful Type 3 75 mm tank gun was intended to address these issues, and an order of 57 was placed with Hitachi. Although production began in 1944, it was hampered by material shortages, and by the bombing of Japan in World War II. Only 31 to 41",

Although production began in 1944, it was hampered by material shortages, and by the bombing of Japan in World War II. Only 31 to 41 units were completed by the time the war ended.\nDesign\nThe Type 3 Ho-Ni III utilized the Type 97 chassis. The main armament of the Type 3 Ho-Ni III was a Type 3 75 mm tank gun, which was based on the 75 mm Type 90 field gun; the field gun itself was loosely based on the French Schneider et Cie Canon de 85 mle 1927. The Type 3 75 mm tank gun was also used in the Type 3 Chi-Nu medium tank. The Type 3 Ho-Ni III 75 mm main gun was mounted in a fully enclosed fighting compartment with its flanks protruding beyond the hull sides, giving the appearance of a gun turret, although in reality it was incapable of rotation. The welded superstructure had sloped armour and the gun mount had additional stamped armor plate. The superstructure had very small observation slits and a small observation hatch on each side. There was a top roof hatch in the superstructure and its rear armour plate formed a double hatch that opened to each side.

He was born in La Conner, Washington, and died in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\nChamberlin studied first at the University of Iowa (where he was influenced by Frank H. Knight), then pursued graduate studies at the University of Michigan, eventually receiving his Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1927.\nEconomics\nFor most of his career Edward Chamberlin taught economics at Harvard (1937 1967). He made significant contributions to microeconomics, particularly on competition theory and consumer choice, and their connection to prices. He coined the term  product differentiation  to describe how a supplier may be able to charge a higher price for a product than perfect competition would allow.\nChamberlin's most significant contribution was the Chamberlinian monopolistic competition theory. He published his book The Theory of Monopolistic Competition in 1933, the same year that Joan Robinson published hers on the same topic: The Economics of Imperfect Competition, so these two economists can be regarded as the parents of the modern study of imperfect competition. Chamberlin's book is often compared to Robinson's in which she coined the term  monopsony  to describe the buyer converse of a seller monopoly.

The key to this is to leverage buyer's preferences and not shoot in the dark and hope for random results; it must be purposeful. Chamberlin also suggested that a monopolistic form of differentiation could present itself in the form of a patent or copyright. While patents and copyrights are empirically monopolistic, it is representative of a monopolist  maximizing his total profit within the market he controls , which still leaves other sellers the opportunity to differentiate their own products. Trademarks are also of consideration, but it is noted that the caveat of trade-marking a product is that it is legally enforceable in that they cannot be used by anyone else.\nChamberlin is informally credited as the founder of Industrial Organization, which is a field of economics that pertains to the ways by which firms compete with one another. This field encompasses many topics, including profit maximization, market power, product quality, and antitrust law, which is imperative when studying firm behavior and business practices (Church and Ware, p. 12).

This field encompasses many topics, including profit maximization, market power, product quality, and antitrust law, which is imperative when studying firm behavior and business practices (Church and Ware, p. 12). Several facets of industrial organization are embedded in Chamberlin's economic theories, including product differentiation and the use of patents to maximize profits and strengthen one's monopolistic position in the market.\nChamberlin is also considered one of the first theorists who applied the marginal revenue idea, which is implicit on Cournot's monopoly theory in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Chamberlin is thought to have conducted  not only the first market experiment, but also the first economic experiment of any kind,  with experiments he used in the classroom to illustrate how prices do not necessarily reach equilibrium. Chamberlin concludes that most market prices are determined by both monopolistic and competitive aspects.\nChamberlin's theory of monopolistic competition is used by sociologist Harrison White in his  markets from networks  model of market structure and competition.\nThe works of Chamberlin, Robinson, and other contributors to the Structure-Conduct-Performance Paradigm were discounted by game theorists in the 1960s, but Nobel-Prize winner Paul Krugman and others built the foundations of the New Theory of International Trade by combining such theories of industrial structure with production functions that assumed significant economies of scale and scope.\nMajor works\n Duopoly: Values where sellers are few",

    "text": "Quasi-set theory is a formal mathematical theory for dealing with collections of objects, some of which may be indistinguishable from one another. Quasi-set theory is mainly motivated by the assumption that certain objects treated in quantum physics are indistinguishable and don't have individuality.\nMotivation\nThe American Mathematical Society sponsored a 1974 meeting to evaluate the resolution and consequences of the 23 problems Hilbert proposed in 1900. An outcome of that meeting was a new list of mathematical problems, the first of which, due to Manin (1976, p. 36), questioned whether classical set theory was an adequate paradigm for treating collections of indistinguishable elementary particles in quantum mechanics. He suggested that such collections cannot be sets in the usual sense, and that the study of such collections required a  new language .\nThe use of the term quasi-set follows a suggestion in da Costa's 1980 monograph Ensaio sobre os Fundamentos da Lógica (see da Costa and Krause 1994), in which he explored possible semantics for what he called  Schrödinger Logics . In these logics, the concept of identity is restricted to some objects of the domain, and has motivation in Schrödinger's claim that the concept of identity does not make sense for elementary particles (Schrödinger 1952). Thus in order to provide a semantics that fits the logic, da Costa submitted that  a theory of quasi-",

Thus in order to provide a semantics that fits the logic, da Costa submitted that  a theory of quasi-sets should be developed , encompassing  standard sets  as particular cases, yet da Costa did not develop this theory in any concrete way. To the same end and independently of da Costa, Dalla Chiara and di Francia (1993) proposed a theory of quasets to enable a semantic treatment of the language of microphysics. The first quasi-set theory was proposed by D. Krause in his PhD thesis, in 1990 (see Krause 1992). A related physics theory, based on the logic of adding fundamental indistinguishability to equality and inequality, was developed and elaborated independently in the book The Theory of Indistinguishables by A. F.

Consider the level 2p of a sodium atom, in which there are six indiscernible electrons. Even so, physicists reason as if there are in fact six entities in that level, and not only one. In this way, by saying that the quasi-cardinal of the power quasi-set of x is 2qc(x) (suppose that qc(x)   6 to follow the example), we are not excluding the hypothesis that there can exist six subquasi-sets of x that are 'singletons', although we cannot distinguish among them.

Whether there are or not six elements in x is something that cannot be ascribed by the theory (although the notion is compatible with the theory). If the theory could answer this question, the elements of x would be individualized and hence counted, contradicting the basic assumption that they cannot be distinguished.\nIn other words, we may consistently (within the axiomatics of \n \n \n \n \n \n Q\n \n \n \n \n   displaystyle   mathfrak  Q   \n \n) reason as if there are six entities in x, but x must be regarded as a collection whose elements cannot be discerned as individuals. Using quasi-set theory, we can express some facts of quantum physics without introducing symmetry conditions (Krause et al. 1999, 2005). As is well known, in order to express indistinguishability, the particles are deemed to be individuals, say by attaching them to coordinates or to adequate functions vectors like  ψ . Thus, given two quantum systems labeled  ψ1  and  ψ2  at the outset, we need to consider a function like  ψ12     ψ1  ψ2     ψ2  ψ1  (except for certain constants), which keep the quanta indistinguishable by permutations; the probability density of the joint system independs on which is quanta  1 and which is quanta  2.

Montandon grew up in Oklahoma during the Great Depression. She lived in San Francisco in the 1960s, where she became known for her talent for hosting memorable parties and for her relationship with Frank Sinatra.\nRoundtable luncheons\nIn the 1970s, Montandon began hosting roundtable luncheons that would frequently include contemporary, controversial talking points. These gatherings featured a range of celebrities, including Andy Warhol, Danielle Steel, Joan Baez, Eldridge Cleaver, and Frank Sinatra. Her lunchtime gatherings continued after her move to Beverly Hills in the 2000s.\nCareer\nUpon moving to San Francisco, Montandon worked during summer, managing a Joseph Magnin clothing store. She later hosted a TV show and became a newspaper columnist for the San Francisco Examiner.\nIn 1979, Montandon conceived the idea of the Napa Valley Wine Auction.

In some languages the vocal cords are actively separated, so it is always voiceless; in others the cords are lax, so that it may take on the voicing of adjacent sounds.\nIt is an oral consonant, which means that air is not allowed to escape through the nose.\nIt is a lateral consonant, which means it is produced by directing the airstream over the sides of the tongue, rather than down the middle.\nIts airstream mechanism is pulmonic, which means it is articulated by pushing air only with the intercostal muscles and abdominal muscles, as in most sounds.\n",

It was inaugurated in 1863 by Ponce Mayor Don Luis de Quixano. Designed by famed engineer Timoteo Luberza, it occupies a city block in the Ponce Historic Zone at the grid formed by Calle Atocha, Estrella, Leon, and Castillo streets. It has room for 65 kiosks. It was originally called Plaza del Capá.\nHistory\nThe building was erected from plans by Timoteo Luberza in 1863, who modeled it after Les Halles, the market of Paris in France. At the time it was built, it was the largest and most modern marketplace in Puerto Rico. It has undergone four major additions and or remodelings since then: in 1903, 1941, 1980 89, and 2006.\n1903 Enlargement\nIn 1903 it was enlarged according to the Neoclassical design of architect Manuel V. Domenech. A meat storage was also added.

During the 1941 remodeling, the original structure, which was not art deco, was enhanced with an art deco facade.\nThe Juan Bigas building\nStarting in 1981, and for the next 26 years, Plaza del Mercado shopkeepers operated out of a new building at the grid formed by Calle Guadalupe, Salud, Estrella and Mayor streets, two blocks east of the historic Plaza del Mercado Isabel II. The new building, called the Plaza del Mercado Juan Bigas building, was inaugurated in 1981 to replace the aging, but historic, Plaza del Mercado Isabel II building. It cost  10 million to build.

The Juan Bigas building had sat unused since the 1990s when the shopkeepers moved back to the remodeled Isabel II building. On 7 April 2011, the municipal government announced it would invest  10 million to remodel the Juan Bigas building and turn it into a municipal services center, dubbed  Ponce Servicios , hosting various municipal services offices. The remodeling of the old Plaza del Mercado Juan Bigas building to be used for municipal government services will occur at a cost of  6.828 million. A 27 July 2011, news report stated work on the Bigas building would commence in October 2011 at an expected cost of  15 million.

In August 2007, the Juan Bigas Building shopkeepers moved back to the historic Plaza del Mercado Isabel II building to occupy it once more as a fruit-and-vegetables market place.\nUniqueness\n The phenomenon of this building, unique in Puerto Rico, is that despite its enlargements, its interior still preserves the original structure. Through its remodelings, its facade has shown several architectural styles, including neoclassical and art deco. \nToday\nToday Plaza de Mercado is also used as a venue for a variety of festivals and other similar gatherings. However, in October 2010, structural and air conditioning problems were found with the newly rebuilt structure.\nSee also\nMercado de las Carnes\nPlaza Juan Ponce de León\nReferences\nFurther reading\nLa Gran Enciclopedia de Puerto Rico, Vol XIX,  Arquitectura y Leyes , Editorial Rumbo, Madrid. 1976.\nAcevedo Cruz, Joaquin.

    "text": "Tetraophasis is a genus of Galliformes in the family Phasianidae, which includes chickens, pheasants, partridges, grouse, turkeys, quail, and peafowl. It contains the following species:\nChestnut-throated monal-partridge or Verreaux's monal-partridge (Tetraophasis obscurus)\nBuff-throated monal-partridge or Szechenyi's monal-partridge (Tetraophasis szechenyii)\nThe name Tetraophasis is a combination of the genus name Tetrao (the name Carl Linnaeus gave grouse in 1758), and the modern Latin word phasis, meaning  pheasant . Monal-partridge are close relatives of monals and more distantly related to tragopan. They are boreal adapted species of high altitudes. Like monals they dig in alpine biomes for tubers, rhizomes and invertebrates as well as rodent pups and voles. Monal-partridges are important prey species for raptors, owls and yellow-throated martens. Like monals, monal-partridges are strictly monogamous. The female incubates the eggs until the last 48, hours when the male may take over the nighttime nest brooding. This is a habit documented in blood pheasants, tragopans and monals. \nBoth sexes rear the chicks, which are not fully mature until their second year. Unlike monals the sexes do not separate during winter. \nMonal-partridges are strong fliers. They evidently compete with koklass as the two are rarely to be heard or seen in the same valleys.\n   References",

There is also bus service to the station from Pace University.\nHistory\nThe New York and Harlem Railroad laid tracks through Pleasantville during the 1840s. Evidence of the existence of Pleasantville station can be found as far back as October 1846. The existing station house was built by the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad in 1905. The station also had freight sidings for the shipping department of the headquarters of Reader's Digest. On December 20, 1956, New York State opened up bids for the elimination of several grade crossings in Pleasantville, though the project was originally planned by New York Central 25 years earlier. The project was expected to cost  3.857 million. The tracks were lowered for 7,000 feet (2,100 m), new bridges were built over the railroad for Manville and Bedford Roads (current and former NY 117 respectively), and the station house was moved. The project was finished by 1959. \nAs with most of the Harlem Line, the merger of New York Central with Pennsylvania Railroad in 1968 transformed the station into a Penn Central Railroad station. Penn Central's continuous financial despair throughout the 1970s forced them to turn over their commuter service to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority which made it part of Metro-North in 1983.

Unlike Plan West (Plan Zachód), it was being prepared during the whole interwar period, as the government of the Second Polish Republic treated the Soviet Union as the greatest potential military threat that was capable of initiating a full-scale war. However, only a few loose historical documents remain of the original plan today.\nBackground\nSince its establishment after World War I, the Second Polish Republic had been involved in wars and conflicts with almost all of its neighbours (see Polish-Soviet War, Polish-Ukrainian War, Polish-Lithuanian War, Greater Poland Uprising, Silesian Uprisings and Border conflicts between Poland and Czechoslovakia). However, only two of the countries were considered to be major threats: Germany and the Soviet Union.\nIn the 1920s and the 1930s, Polish leaders focused their efforts on countering the potential threat from the east. Fresh were memories of the Polish-Soviet War and the Battle of Warsaw, which saved Poland and the rest of Europe from the spread of the Bolshevik Revolution by force.\nSince both the Polish Army and the government in Warsaw were certain that war against the Soviets was inevitable, preparations for it were far more advanced than those against Germany.

It was only after 1935, when anti-Polish propaganda in Germany increased, that the German threat became visible enough for army planners to begin drawing up Plan West. Even in 1939, the number of completed fortifications in the east of Poland vastly outnumbered those in the west.\nInterbellum Polish Soviet border\nPoland's border with the Soviet Union was 1,412 km long. By comparison, the border with Germany, including East Prussia, was more than 20  longer, at 1,912 km. Neither border contained any major geographical obstacles, which made their defence very difficult.\nIn the north was flat land with huge forests such as Puszcza Nalibocka, the Wilderness of Naliboki. In addition, a major railway connecting Moscow to Western Europe extended across the northern Poland. The area's major conurbation was Wilno, in the northeast of interbellum Poland.\nThe centre of the country was primarily a huge sparsely populated swamp, known as Polesie.

In addition, the Soviet border was marked by a natural obstacle, the Zbruch River.\nVirtually all Polish industrial and urban centres were in the west and so a long-lasting defence was possible, as a Soviet force would have taken up to several weeks to reach Upper Silesia, Warsaw, Kraków or Poznań.\nWhen they developed the plan, Polish planners assumed that co-operation and support would be forthcoming from Romania, which was Poland's main eastern ally.\nBorder conflicts\nThe Soviet government undermined the validity of the Riga Peace Treaty, which it had signed in 1921, from the outset. In the early 1920s, the Soviets repeatedly organized guerrilla attacks on Polish settlements close to the border. The most famous one was the attack on Stolpce, which took place on the night of August 3 4, 1924",

The most famous one was the attack on Stolpce, which took place on the night of August 3 4, 1924, which prompted the creation of the Korpus Ochrony Pogranicza (Border Protection Corps). Such attacks continued throughout the 1920s but reduced in scale during the 1930s, particularly after the signing of the 1932 Soviet Polish Non-Aggression Pact.\nSummary\nNo complete copy of the plan has been preserved. All that is known are the basic precepts, and restoring the whole plan is impossible. Work on the document was completed on February 4, 1939. The plan was based on the notions of Józef Piłsudski, who until his death in 1935 was sure that war would come from the east. Thus, most army maneuvers and field fortifications were held in the east, and Poland's western border was largely neglected. Some of the fortifications can still be seen in the area around Sarny (see Sarny Fortified Area). Bunkers built by Polish Corps of Engineers in the 1930s were used in late 1940s by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army in its guerilla skirmishes against the Soviet Red Army.\nPolish planners were well aware that the Red Army was, in many ways, superior to their",

Therefore, the main idea was to organize a so-called  resistance in motion  and to try to split Soviet forces south and north of the vast Polesie swamps. Frontline armies, in the vicinity of the border, were to try to delay the advance of the aggressors and to bleed them, and reserves, mostly in the areas of Brześć nad Bugiem and Lublin, were intended to enter the conflict in its later stages.\nThe Poles were expecting the Red Army to advance in three directions: along the Minsk Baranowicze Białystok Warsaw rail line, along the Sarny Kowel Lublin line and along the Tarnopol Lwów line.\nStructure of Polish Army\nAccording to the Polish historian Rajmund Szubański, in case of war in the east, the bulk of the Polish Army would be concentrated in the north and the south, with the central section of the border left mostly unguarded. Some military historians claim that Polish planners placed too many units close to the border, which would have resulted in their total destruction in the opening days of the conflict.

Consequently, Plan East became void. On September 17, with a free hand because of the Molotov Ribbentrop Pact, the Soviets broke their non-aggression pact by invading Poland. The Red Army met little resistance, as the Polish Army was concentrated in the west in fighting the Germans. Thus, the Soviets quickly managed to occupy Polish Kresy.\nSee also\nPrometheism\nSarny Fortified Area\nReferences\nFurther reading\nRajmund Szubański, Plan operacyjny  Wschód , Warsaw 1994, ISBN 83-11-08313-4\nStanisław Feret, Polska sztuka wojenna 1918-39, Warsaw 1972.\nExternal links\nPlan operacyjny  Wschód  discussed on a University of Warsaw forum (in Polish)\nPOLSKI PLAN OBRONNY ZACHÓD (in Polish)\nPolish interbellum fortifications in Ukraine - present day photos (in Ukrainian)",

The box is located next to a level crossing which separates the two staggered platforms. There was a warehouse and a crane nearby and a small goods yard which closed in 1964. The crossing gates are still hand worked by the crossing keeper   the Grade II listed box was formerly a block post, but no longer works as such (the block section now runs from Gaerwen to Valley).\nFacilities\nThe station is unstaffed and has no ticketing provision   all tickets must be bought in advance or on the train. The station buildings still stand and are now used as a private residence; basic waiting shelters are provided for passenger use on each side. Digital display screens, timetable posters and a telephone provide train running information. Step-free access is available to both platforms via ramps from the road that crosses the line here, though the gradient on both makes the station unsuitable for wheelchair users.\nServices\nThere is a two-hourly weekday service in each direction from the station. Most eastbound trains run to Wrexham General, Shrewsbury and Birmingham International, although a small number run to either Crewe or Cardiff instead.\nThe Sunday service is irregular (six westbound, seven eastbound) and runs mainly to from Crewe with one service to Wrexham and Cardiff.\nReferences\nFurther reading\nMitchell, Vic; Smith, Keith (2011).

On the same day, the European Democratic Lawyers association requested the  immediate  release of the Catalan leaders and expressed their  concern  because of the  lack of procedural guarantees during the trial .\nOn 29 May 2019, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention urged Spain to release Sànchez, Cuixart and Junqueras and to investigate their  arbitrary  detention and the violation of theirs rights, as well as compensating them for the time spent in jail. The Spanish government criticised the report, arguing that the reasoning for their opinion did not take into account some of the alleged crimes. Spain's government issued a statement that raised  doubts  about the group's  independence and impartiality  and called on the U.N. to make sure that its semi-independent working groups are not used  for spurious purposes .\nAfter Sànchez was sentenced to a nine-year sentence, Amnesty International reiterated his petition to immediately release Sànchez and Cuixart and denounced that the  vague  and  overly broad  interpretation of sedition done by the Spanish Supreme Court could have negative effects on the freedom of protest in Spain.\nHe was finally freed in June 2021 following a government pardon, together with other eight politicians imprisoned in connection with the Catalan independence referendum.\n   References",

Officials called it the  Mason County War ; locally it was called the  Hoodoo War . Cooley retaliated by killing local German ex-deputy sheriff John Worley, then taking his scalp and tossing his body down a well on August 10, 1875.\nCooley already had a reputation as a dangerous man and was respected as a Texas Ranger. He killed several others during the  war . After Cooley supporter Moses Baird was killed, Ringo murdered James Cheyney on September 25, 1875, with a friend named Bill Williams. They rode up to Cheyney's house. Cheyney (who had led Baird into the ambush) greeted them unarmed, invited them in, and began washing his face on the porch. Both Ringo and Williams shot and killed him. The two then rode to the house of Dave Doole and called him outside, but he came out with a gun and they fled back into town.\nSome time later, Scott Cooley and Johnny Ringo mistook Charley Bader for his brother Pete and killed him.

Scott Cooley was thought to be dead and Johnny Ringo and his friend George Gladden were in jail. One of Ringo's alleged cellmates was the notorious killer John Wesley Hardin. While Gladden was sentenced to 99 years, Ringo appears to have been acquitted. Two years later, Ringo was a constable in Loyal Valley, Texas. Soon after this, he traveled to Arizona.\nLife in Tombstone\nRingo first appeared in Cochise County, Arizona Territory in 1879 with Joseph Graves Olney (alias  Joe Hill ), a friend from the Mason County War. In December 1879, a drunk Ringo shot unarmed Louis Hancock in a Safford, Arizona saloon when Hancock refused a complimentary drink of whiskey, stating that he preferred beer. Hancock survived his wound. Soon after arriving in Tombstone, Arizona, he met editor Sam Purdy of The Tombstone Epitaph, who later writes of their talk:  He said that he was as certain of being killed as he was of living then.

He said that he might run along for a couple years more, and may not last two days.  In Tombstone, Ringo developed a reputation as having a bad temper. He may have participated in robberies and killings with the Cochise County Cowboys, a loosely associated group of outlaws. He was occasionally erroneously referred to as  Ringgold  by local newspapers. He described himself as a  speculator  in the 1882 Cochise County Great Register.\nConfrontation with Doc Holliday\nOn January 17, 1882, Ringo and Doc Holliday traded threats and seemed headed for a gunfight. Both men were arrested by Tombstone's chief of police, James Flynn, and hauled before a judge for carrying weapons in town. Both were fined. Judge William H. Stilwell followed up on charges outstanding against Ringo for a robbery in Galeyville and Ringo was re-arrested and jailed on January 20 for the weekend. Ringo was suspected by the Earps of taking part in the December 28, 1881, ambush of Virgil Earp, that crippled him for life, and the March 18, 1882, murder of Morgan Earp while he was shooting pool in a Tombstone saloon.\nJoins pos",

After the shooting, the Earps and a federal posse set out on a vendetta to find and kill the others they held responsible for ambushing Virgil and Morgan. Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan received warrants from a Tucson judge for arrest of the Earps and Holliday. He deputized Ringo and 19 other men, many of them friends of Stilwell and the Cochise County Cowboys.\nDuring the Earp Vendetta Ride, Wyatt Earp killed one of Ringo's closest friends,  Curly Bill  Brocius, in a gunfight at Iron Springs (later Mescal Springs) about 20 miles (32 km) from Tombstone. Earp told his biographer, Stuart Lake, that a man named Florentino Cruz confessed to being the lookout at Morgan's murder and identified Ringo, Stilwell, Swilling, and Brocius as Morgan's killers, \nThe local posse pursued and came close to the federal posse at Henry C.

He said the Earp posse had told Hooker to tell Behan and his posse where they were camped. Hooker told Behan where the Earps were camped but the posse left in the opposite direction.\nDeath\nDuring Tombstone's Fourth of July festivities, Ringo drank heavily. He left town two days later, taking several bottles of liquor for the ride. Deputy Billy Breakenridge saw him two days later near Dial's Ranch in the South Pass of the Dragoon Mountains. He later wrote that  Ringo was very drunk, reeling in the saddle.  He encouraged Ringo to follow him back to the Goodrich Ranch, but  he was drunk and stubborn and went on his way.

He was  not more than 700 feet from Smith's house  in West Turkey Creek Valley, near Chiricahua Peak in Arizona Territory. His body had already turned black from the desert heat.\nHis feet were wrapped in strips of cloth torn from his undershirt. Ringo had lost his horse with his boots tied to the saddle. The coroner's report noted that  He had evidently traveled but a short distance in this foot gear.  There was a bullet hole in his right temple and an exit wound at the back of his head. The fatal wound was upward at a 45-degree angle between the right eye and ear. His revolver was still in his right hand.\nAccording to the coroner's report, Ringo's Colt Single Action Army .45 revolver held five cartridges.

His horse was found eleven days later about 2 miles (3.2 km) away with Ringo's boots still tied to the saddle. A coroner's inquest officially ruled his death a suicide.\nRingo's body is buried near the base of the tree where it was discovered. The grave is located on private land. A gate on a nearby road permits visitors to view the site. Despite the coroner's ruling and contemporaneous newspaper reports that Ringo had  frequently threatened to commit suicide, and that the event was expected at any time , alternative theories of doubtful plausibility about Ringo's death have been proposed over the years. Some assert that the lack of powder burns on his head suggest he was shot from a distance. The coroner's jury report does not mention the presence or absence of powder burns. Furthermore, Ringo's body was already turning black due to decomposition.\nRobert Boller, a member of the coroner's jury, wrote in 1934,  I showed  James Yoast  where the bullet had entered the tree on the left side. Blood and brains  were  oozing from the wound and matted his hair. There was an empty shell in the six-shooter and the hammer was on that. I called it a suicide fifty",

I guess I'm the last of the coroner's jury. \nWyatt Earp claims\nAccording to the book I Married Wyatt Earp, which author and collector Glen Boyer claimed to have assembled from manuscripts written by Earp's fourth wife, Josephine Marcus Earp, Earp and Doc Holliday returned to Arizona with some friends in early July and found Ringo camped in West Turkey Creek Valley. As Ringo attempted to flee up the canyon, Earp shot him with a rifle. Boyer refused to produce his source manuscripts, and reporters wrote that his explanations were conflicting and not credible. New York Times contributor Allen Barra wrote that I Married Wyatt Earp  ... is now recognized by Earp researchers as a hoax. \nTombstone historian Ben T. Traywick thought the story about Earp's involvement was credible, reasoning that only Earp had sufficient motive, he was probably in the area at the time, and near the end of his life he told one historian  in circumstantial detail how he killed John Ringo .

Bancroft, and in 1932, Frank Lockwood, who authored Pioneer Days in Arizona, wrote that Earp told both of them that he killed Ringo as he left Arizona in March 1882   almost four months before Ringo died. He included other details that do not match what is known about Ringo's death. Earp repeated his story to at least three other people. In an interview with a reporter in Denver in 1896, Earp denied that he had killed Ringo; but later, privately, claimed once again that he had.\nDoc Holliday story\nThe Holliday theory is similar to the Earp theory, except that Holliday is alleged to have killed Ringo. A variant, popularized in the movie Tombstone, asserts that Holliday stepped in for Earp in response to a gunfight challenge from Ringo and shot him. Records of the Pueblo County, Colorado District Court indicate that Holliday and his attorney appeared in court on July 11, 14, and 18, 1882 to answer charges of  larceny . However, a writ of capias was issued for him on the 11th, suggesting that he did not in fact appear in court on that date. Ringo's body",

Six days before Ringo's death, the Pueblo Daily Chieftain reported that Holliday was in Salida, Colorado, about 670 miles (1,080 km) from Turkey Creek, Arizona; and then in Leadville, about 700 miles (1,100 km) distant, on July 18. There was still an arrest warrant outstanding on Holliday in Arizona for his part in Frank Stilwell's murder, making it unlikely that he would have entered Arizona at that time.\nMichael O'Rourke theory\nSome accounts attribute Ringo's death to Michael O'Rourke, an itinerant gambler who was arrested in Tucson in January 1881 on suspicion of murdering a mining engineer named Henry Schneider. Wyatt Earp is said to have protected him from being lynched by a mob organized and led by Ringo. O'Rourke escaped from jail in April 1881 and never stood trial on the murder charges.\nThe last documented sighting of O'Rourke was in the Dragoon Mountains near Tombstone during May 1881,  well-mounted and equipped , and presumably on his way out of the territory.

While some sources consider the story plausible, others point out that O'Rourke, like Holliday, would have been reluctant to re-enter Arizona with a murder warrant hanging over his head, particularly to commit another murder.\nFrank Leslie claim\nWhile in the Yuma Territorial Prison for killing his wife, Buckskin Frank Leslie reputedly confessed to a guard that he had killed Ringo. Few believed his story, and some thought he was simply claiming credit for it to curry favor with Earp's inner circle, or for whatever notoriety it might bring him.\nIn popular culture\nFilm and television\nThe character of Johnny Ringo has been depicted in the following film and television shows:\nThe Gunfighter (1950) depicts Jimmy Ringo, a fictional depiction of Johnny Ringo's life\nCity of Bad Men (1953) played by Richard Boone\nThe Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp includes two episodes depicting Ringo.

In the early sketches, the only other visible objects in the room were a simple wooden chair in which the boy usually sat, and a paneled door in the background. Later sketches occasionally included one or two additional inanimate objects, but the chair would always be visible in the shot during each sketch.

    "text": "Ann Louise Nixon Cooper (January 9, 1902 - December 21, 2009) was a centenarian best known for being invoked in United States President-elect Barack Obama's November 2008 election speech as someone who had witnessed  the struggle and the progress  of the past century, and as a representative of the change in status that African-Americans and women have achieved in America. Before that, she was a noted member of the Atlanta African-American community and an activist for civil rights.\nBiography\nCooper was born in Shelbyville, Tennessee, on January 9, 1902, and raised in Nashville. She moved to Atlanta, Georgia, in her early-twenties with her husband, Albert Berry Cooper, a dentist, and they had four children together. During that time, she served more than fifty years in public work on the board of Gate City Nursery Association and also helped found the Girls Club for African-American Youth. Because there were no integrated Boy Scout troops in 1930s Atlanta, she wrote to the Boy Scouts in New York for help in starting Troop 95, Atlanta's first Boy Scout troop for African-Americans. When her husband died, Martin Luther King Jr. sent Cooper a telegram; she also met with Coretta Scott King and saved photographs of the occasion. Cooper first registered to vote on September 1, 1941. Although she was friends with elite Black Atlantans like W. E. B. Du Bo",

Although she was friends with elite Black Atlantans like W. E. B. Du Bois, John Hope Franklin and Benjamin Mays, she did not exercise her right to vote for years, because of her status as a black woman in a segregated and sexist society.\nDuring the 1970s, she served as a tutor to non-readers at Ebenezer Baptist Church. She also served on the Friends of the Library Board, serving at one time as vice president of the board. In 1980, she received a Community Service Award from Channel 11 for being one of the organizers of the black Cub Scouts and serving as the first den mother for three and a half years.\nShe was also awarded the Annie L. McPheeters Medallion for community service from the Auburn Avenue Research Library on African American Culture and History in 2002.\nHer grandson is Lawrence D. Bobo, the W. E. B. Du Bois Professor of the Social Sciences and the Dean of Social Science at Harvard University.\nAge issue\nWhen featured in Obama's 2008 speech, Cooper was 106 years old.

After two voyages for Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, she was acquired by the Navy 9 January 1942, converted to a fleet oiler, and renamed Housatonic.\nShakedown training in Chesapeake Bay ended 10 March, and Housatonic joined Service Force, Atlantic Fleet. During the remainder of 1942 Housatonic carried fuel oil and aviation gas from the Gulf of Mexico to ports on the Atlantic Coast and in the Caribbean. A shortage of escorts necessitated the oiler's proceeding alone through waters infested with German submarines which were making many kills at that time. In July, the fleet oiler performed her first fueling at sea, servicing carrier Ranger (CV-4), cruiser Augusta (CA-31), and six destroyers engaged in ferrying U.S. Army P-40 fighter planes aboard the carrier from Port of Spain to Akkra on the Gold Coast of Africa.

It has an area of 1,911.6 hectares (4,724 acres) with an estimated population of 29,046.\nHistory\nDuring the reign of Sultan Abu Bakar of Johor and under the influence of the British rule in the 1870s, a policy was initiated to modernise Johor and increase tax revenue by opening up more of the forest and swamp area for plantation purposes (initially for spices such as pepper and gambier; then followed by rubber). But to do so, they need massive number of workers. Coincidentally the political and social chaos in Southern China during that period (ref: History of China) made the Chinese migrants an obvious choice. Some of these early Chinese pioneers travelled from the river mouth starting from Batu Pahat and along the Bekok River (Sungai Bekok) and settled upon a fertile land not far from where Sungai Bekok and Sungai Sedi meets.\nIn fact, in 1800, there were only five Malay houses standing on the banks of Sungai Bekok and on Bukit Jambu (once sited the Bee Seng Sawmill and now the Yong Peng District Council). The town was known at that time as  Sri Bertam , named after a tree by the name  Bertam Tree  in Kampong Bukit J",

The Malays were then ruled by Arujamin Bin Runshut and most of them had just escaped from the Dutch after losing the war to the latter in Acheh.\nIn November 1847, four Chinese immigrants from Chaozhou led by Boo Koh Lak Loo (better known as Ah Loh) came to Sri Bertam by boat after paddling up Sungai Bekok. They then built three houses at the present Government Clinic compound. Later he and his men with the help of his Malay friends began to clear some thick forests around the river banks. When this small settlement prospered and progressed, Boo named the place Yong Peng or Everlasting Peace in Chinese.\nBoo ruled Yong Peng according to the  Kangchu  or headman system where the Chinese word  Kang  means river while  Chu  means house. But essentially,  Chu  is the clan name of the first headman in charge of the plantations in the area.\nWhen more Chinese of other dialects began moving to Yong Peng, the settlement was also expanded further up the river, opening up two more areas - one was Mah Kau Kang and the other one was Seng Kang (now Kangkar Bahru).\nDuring this time,",

Local produce such as pepper and gambir were transported by boat to Batu Pahat and some to as far as Singapore; the whole journey taking about 16 days.\nKangchu Boo would also give a yearly report of Yong Peng to Sultan Abu Bakar. In order to keep law and order, one Malay by the name of Ismail was appointed the policeman of Yong Peng. Minor offences were dealt with by Kangchu Boo whilst more serious ones were sent to the magistrate's court in Batu Pahat.\nKangchu Boo died in 1907 at the age of 76. His body was buried in Tang Hak (old name for Jalan Masjid). It is around Jalan Ann Peng. After his death, his son Kangchu Boo Koh Soon Meng took over at the young age of 25. He ruled for about 35 years until his death in 1942.

However, conflict with the Communist Party of Malaya, their former ally during the Japanese occupation, emerged. In 1950, in order to contain the communist insurgency, the British instituted as part of the Briggs Plan the policy of forced relocation of large number of people and moved them into specially created settlements called  New Villages . This strategy was to prevent Communist sympathisers from supporting and supplying food to the insurgents. These camps were surrounded by barb wires and guarded day and night. Other than night curfews, residents of the camp were also strictly prohibited from carrying additional food or tools in or out of the camp. Curfews would commence at 6 o'clock in the evening and ended at 6 the next morning. In Yong Peng, a few thousand squatters who were living and cultivating along isolated jungle fringes were thus resettled in the new village.\nSo, Jalan Templer in Yong Peng was named after the then British High Commissioner General Gerald Templer who was known for making this famous remark,  The answer  to the uprising  lies not in pouring more troops into the jungle, but in the hearts and minds of the people.

Luckily, the Chinese Penghulu (Head Villager) from Yong Peng and the Malay Penghulus from the surrounding Kampungs had a relatively good relationship; and working together they cobbled several arrangements that help prevent the severe bloodshed seen in other urban areas.\nThen in the mid-1970s, the town was again affected by gang fights among rival gangster groups which usually took place at night outside the only cinema in Yong Peng at Jalan Templer.

He played as a forward for several teams including Sheffield Wednesday, Notts County and Aston Villa. When he was transferred to Sheffield Wednesday from Notts County, for  34,500, he was the most expensive signing in English football. When Sewell captained the newly independent nation of Zambia in October 1964, he became one of the few footballers who have played for two different countries.

The replica Jeanie Johnston performs a number of functions. At sea it is an ocean-going sail training vessel; in port, it converts into a living history museum on 19th century emigration and, in the evenings, is used as a corporate event venue.\nOriginal ship\nThe original Jeanie Johnston was bought by Tralee-based merchants John Donovan   Sons, as a cargo vessel and traded successfully between Tralee and North America for a number of years. The trading pattern was to bring emigrants from Ireland to North America, and then to bring timber back to Europe.\nFamine voyages\nThe ship made a voyage from County Kerry to Quebec on 24 April 1848, with 193 emigrants on board, as the effects of the Great Famine ravaged Ireland. Between 1848 and 1855, the Jeanie Johnston made 16 voyages to North America, sailing to Quebec, Baltimore, and New York. On average, the length of the transatlantic journey was 47 days. The most passengers she ever carried was 254, from Tralee to Quebec on 17 April 1852. To put this number in perspective, the replica ship is only licensed to carry 40 people including crew.\nDespite the number of passengers and the long voyage, no crew or passenger",

To put this number in perspective, the replica ship is only licensed to carry 40 people including crew.\nDespite the number of passengers and the long voyage, no crew or passenger lives were ever lost on board the Jeanie Johnston. This is generally attributed to the captain, James Attridge, not overloading the ship, and the presence of a qualified doctor, Richard Blennerhassett, on board for the passengers. This lack of mortality contrasted sharply with coffin ships that carried many other Irish immigrants.\nIn 1855, the ship was sold to William Johnson of North Shields in England. In 1858, en route to Quebec from Hull with a cargo of timber, she became waterlogged. The crew climbed into the rigging, and after nine days clinging to their slowly-sinking ship, they were rescued by a Dutch ship, the Sophie Elizabeth. Even in her loss, she maintained her perfect safety record.\nReplica\nConstruction and design\nThe project was conceived in the late 1980s, but did not become a reality until November 1993 when a feasibility study was completed. In May 1995, The Jeanie Johnston (Ireland) Company Ltd. was incorporated. The ship was designed by Fred Walker, former Chief Naval Architect with the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, England.

The recreation project was modeled closely on that of the 17th century ship, the Batavia, and the Matthew in Bristol.\nAn international team of young people, linking Ireland North and South, the United States, Canada, and many other countries, built the replica under the supervision of experienced shipwrights. The original cost had been projected at  4.265m sterling (  5.8m) in 1993 and the final cost was just under  14m in 2002. The final figure includes the seagoing ship, shipyard, workshops and visitor centre at Blennerville, cost of launch, fit out at Fenit and the cost of training in shipbuilding skills provided by FÁS, the training and employment authority, to some 50 unemployed young people. The escalation in cost was attributed to the complex nature of the project, the delay in getting the project underway and completed (9 years), and the efforts made to meet an unachievable completion deadline of June 2000. The cost of the project was borne by the Irish government, Kerry County Council, Tralee Town Council, the European Union, the American Ireland Fund, Shannon Development, Kerry Group, the FÁS, and the Irish Department of the Marine, most of which later agreed to write off their losses.",

These checks revealed that the ship would float higher than anticipated in the water, causing stability problems. To rectify the problem, a steel keel was attached beneath the original oak keel. This is the reason that the Jeanie Johnston draws more water than most ships of her size and cannot enter some ports the original ship would have been able to visit, such as Nantucket. However, she has proved to be remarkably stable even in the harshest weather conditions at sea.

There she was fitted with masts and sails, and on 4 May was transported to Fenit, a short distance away. On 6 May, the barge was submerged and the Jeanie Johnston took to the water for the first time.

During that time she carried approximately 980 sail trainees and over 2,500 passengers, making regular visits to ports around Britain and Ireland, and also undertaking several trips to Spain each summer, often carrying voyage crew who intended to join the Camino de Santiago.

After a month, the Guirauds traveled to Cincinnati, Ohio, where Adolphe engaged in several occupations. He was first a wine dealer, but his building burned down. Adolphe then ran a farm followed by a bakery. \nThe couple each began a business in Leavenworth, Kansas, but Guiraud had to shut down her coffee shop due to ill health. Adolphe made plans with Frank Maywell to start a business in the Colorado Territory to capitalize on influx of people to Colorado during the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. Adolphe and Maywell, his partner, opened a mercantile business in Hamilton at Tarryall Creek. About 186",

It is typically formed by a cysteine residue and a dehydrated serine residue. Despite its name, lanthionine does not contain the element lanthanum.\nBackground\nIn 1941, lanthionine was first isolated by treating wool with sodium carbonate. It was found to be a sulfur-containing amino acid; accordingly it was given the name lanthionine  wool (Latin: Lana), sulfur (Greek: theîon) . Lanthionine was first synthesized by alkylation of cysteine with β-chloroalanine. Lanthionines are found widely in nature. They have been isolated from human hair, lactalbumin, and feathers. Lanthionines have also been found in bacterial cell walls and are the components of a group of gene-encoded peptide antibiotics called lantibiotics, which includes nisin (a food preservative), subtilin, epidermin (effective against Staphylococcus and Streptococcus), and ancovenin (an enzyme inhibitor).\nLanthionine is listed among novel uremic toxins, compounds elevated in blood of chronic kidney failure and uremic patiens. \nIt likely contributes to hyperhomocysteinemia and impaired hydrogen sulfide biosynthesis.\nLanthionine",

The sulfur extrusion method is, however, the only pathway for lanthionine that has been employed in the total synthesis of a lantibiotic.\nBiosynthesis of the lanthionine bridge in peptidic natural products can be accomplished through a number of different pathways. For example, the lanthionine bridges in the antibiotic nisin are the result of a dedicated dehydratase (NisB) and a dedicated cyclase (NisC).\n   References",

He was imprisoned for years by King Hassan II of Morocco, for his political actions in favor of democracy, during the Years of Lead. He paid a high price for such actions: fifteen months living underground, seventeen years of imprisonment and eight years of exile. He returned to Morocco in September 1999.\nLife and politics\nAbraham Serfaty was born in Casablanca, on 16 January 1926, to a middle-class Moroccan Jewish family originally from Tangier. He graduated in 1949 from École des Mines de Paris, one of the most prominent French engineering schools.\nHis political activities started very early. In February 1944, he joined the Moroccan Youth Communists, and, upon his arrival in France in 1945, the French Communist Party. When he returned to Morocco in 1949, he joined the Moroccan Communist Party.

It has some common elements with, but is a complete independent development from the English Morris dance. As with most Tongan dances, the whole performance is to dazzle the spectators and to please the chiefs. There is no hidden purpose.\nHistory\nThe exact origins of the eke are disputed. Historian Edwin Burrows describes it as having a  martial character , while anthropologist Harley Harris Bartlett suggests that it may be originally agricultural. The tabloid The Catholic Weekly has claimed that it originated as penance for the 1841 killing of Catholic priest Peter Chanel. \nWith the introduction of Catholicism in Tonga, they brought the eke with them, first to Tafahi, then to Niuafoʻou. After the volcanic eruption of their island in 1946 the people of Niuafoʻou were resettled on ʻEua. From there the eke, by then named sōkē came to Tongatapu, to the Catholic diocese of Maʻufanga to be more exact, which brought it into Tonga's mainstream.\nPerformance\nA single vaka (boat) consists of 2 men and 2 women facing each other.

The place is called Pua-toli-nofo (flower picked sitting down).\nMost of the words of the song are quite unintelligeable in modern Tongan, but some words (seafaring terms, like matangi angi pea moe, the wind blows and then sleeps) and names (like Lavelua and Futuna) can be distinguished which give a clue to its origin. Also the ʻUvean and Futunan versions are in such old language that it is not clear which language it is. The two pieces above, however, are rather ʻUvean.\nGallery\nReferences\nW.

    "text": "The noun skeet in Newfoundland and Labrador English is considered to be a pejorative epithet. Though it has never been formally defined in the Dictionary of Newfoundland English, it is used as a stereotype to describe someone who is ignorant, aggressive, and unruly, with a pattern of vernacular use of English, drug and alcohol use, and who is involved in petty crime.  Skeet  is very similar to the word  chav  used in the UK.\nFrom this noun, the adjective  skeety  is derived.\nHistory\nThe origin of this use of skeet is unknown. However, it is possible that it is a new use of an old word, coming out of the use of skeet as 'rascal'. There have been some who theorize that the use of the word skeet is linked to the townie versus bayman divide in Newfoundland and Labrador and how it speaks to class, education, and use of vernacular Newfoundland English.\nUse as pejorative\nSkeet has been called a pan-provincial slur against rural life. It is linked to stereotypes of those living in outport communities: the use of vernacular Newfoundland English, living in economically poor areas, and to lower levels of education. Though vernacular use of English is on the decline in Newfoundland and Labrador, those that continue to speak using non-standard forms of English are often stereotyped as uneducated fishermen from Newfoundland outports.\nSkeets are characterised as rough around",

Though vernacular use of English is on the decline in Newfoundland and Labrador, those that continue to speak using non-standard forms of English are often stereotyped as uneducated fishermen from Newfoundland outports.\nSkeets are characterised as rough around the edges, unintelligent, poorly dressed, and poorly spoken. However, of equal importance is the skeets' connection to petty crime, and drug and alcohol use. Skeet stereotype is linked to those living in economically poor areas and lower levels of education. The stigma of being from a lower income area, or dropping out of school is associated with being a skeet, and it is unlikely that an educated or professional person would be associated with the term unless it was used in jest.\nPhillip Hiscock, associate professor of folklore at Memorial University of Newfoundland has said that using the word skeet says more about the person using it than the person being referred to. He also claims it is more a reflection of modern post-capitalism culture than a true identity.\nThis use of skeet is virtually unknown outside of the province, though people displaying the same characteristics may be referred to as white trash or trailer trash in some areas of Canada and the United States, chav in the United Kingdom, spide in Northern Ireland, or skanger in Ireland.

    "text": "Radio Luxembourg was a multilingual commercial broadcaster in Luxembourg. It is known in most non-English languages as RTL (for Radio Television Luxembourg).\nThe English-language service of Radio Luxembourg began in 1933 as one of the earliest commercial radio stations broadcasting to both the United Kingdom and Ireland. The station provided a way to circumvent British legislation which until 1973 gave the BBC a monopoly of radio broadcasting on UK territory and prohibited all forms of advertising over the domestic radio spectrum. It boasted the most powerful privately owned transmitter in Europe (200 kW, broadcasting on long wave). In the late 1930s, and again in the 1950s and 1960s, it had large audiences across Britain and Ireland with its programmes of popular entertainment, and was an important forerunner of pirate radio and modern commercial radio in Britain. \nRadio Luxembourg's parent company, RTL Group, continued its involvement in broadcasts to a UK audience with the British TV channel then known as Five until it was sold in July 2010.\nBackground and origins\nIn 1922, the British government awarded a monopoly broadcasting licence to the British Broadcasting Company (BBC), whose shares were owned by British and American electrical companies. Although in theory the BBC could have sold sponsored airtime, its income instead came from selling its own brand of licensed radio receivers manufactured by its owners. This arrangement lasted until 1927, when the broadcasting licence of the original BBC was allowed to expire. The assets of the former commercial company",

This arrangement lasted until 1927, when the broadcasting licence of the original BBC was allowed to expire. The assets of the former commercial company were then sold to a new non-commercial British Broadcasting Corporation, which operated under a UK charter from the Crown.\nWith no possibility of commercial broadcasting available from inside the UK, Leonard Plugge   a former British Royal Air Force captain and entrepreneur (and from 1935 Conservative Party member of parliament)   set up his own International Broadcasting Company, which leased time on transmitters in continental Europe and resold it as sponsored English-language programming aimed at audiences in Britain and Ireland. Because Plugge successfully demonstrated that state monopolies such as that of the BBC could be broken, other parties became attracted to the idea of creating a new commercial radio station specifically for this purpose.\nFormation of Radio Luxembourg\nIn 1924, radio technician François Anen built a 100-watt transmitter in his home in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Within two years, the government of Luxembourg had reached an agreement to subsidize the station to broadcast military music concerts and plays performed in the Luxembourgish language. With its central location in western Europe, the Grand Duchy was an ideal site for broadcasts to many nations, including the United Kingdom.\nAnen became inspired by the activities of Captain Plugge, who was using transmitters licensed in other countries to broadcast English-language radio programmes",

On 11 May 1929, he brought together a group of mainly French entrepreneurs to form the Luxembourg Society for Radio Studies (La Société Luxembourgeoise d'Études Radiophoniques) as a pressure group to force the Luxembourg government to issue them a commercial broadcasting licence.\nOn 19 December 1930, the government of Luxembourg passed a law awarding a monopoly licence to operate a commercial radio broadcasting franchise from the Grand Duchy. On 29 December, this licence was awarded to the Society, which in turn created the Luxembourg Broadcasting Company (Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Radiodiffusion) to be identified on the air as Radio Luxembourg.\nFrom 1932, German journalist Eva Siewert worked as editor-in-chief and trilingual head spokeswoman for the station in German, English and French. In May 1932, Radio Luxembourg began high-powered test transmissions aimed directly at Britain and Ireland (which proved, inadvertently, to be the first radio modification of the ionosphere).

The reaction of the British government was hostile, as the long-wave band used for these tests carried a signal far superior to anything previously received from outside the country. The British government accused Radio Luxembourg of  pirating  the various wavelengths it was testing. \nThe station had planned to start regular broadcasts on 4 June 1933, but the complaints caused Radio Luxembourg to keep shifting its wavelength. The English service was leased to Radio Publicity (London) Ltd in the United Kingdom. In December 1933, Radio Publicity (London) transferred 23-year-old Stephen Williams from directing its English-language programmes transmitted over Radio Paris to become the first manager of the English-language service of Radio Luxembourg. Programmes in English debuted on 3 December 1933 under the editorial guidance of Stephen Williams.\nOn 1 January 1934, a new international agreement, the Lucerne Convention or European Wavelength Plan (which the Luxembourg government refused to sign) came into effect, and shortly afterwards Radio Luxembourg started a regular schedule of English-language transmissions from 8:15 am to midnight on Sundays, and at various times during the rest of the week.

Around 11  of Britons listened to it during the week, preferring Luxembourg's light music and variety programmes to the BBC. Up to half of Britons did so before 10:15 am on weekdays when the BBC did not broadcast, and at weekends when it followed the Reith Sunday schedule of only serious and religious programmes.\nThe BBC and successive British governments continued to oppose the competition, citing Radio Luxembourg's use of an unauthorised frequency. As the station could not use General Post Office telephone lines to broadcast from London, many English-language programmes were recorded there and flown to Luxembourg. Despite the opposition, by 1938 many British companies advertised on Radio Luxembourg and fellow European broadcaster Radio Normandy. The stations thus exposed millions of Britons and British companies to commercial broadcasting, which contributed to the creation of the commercial ITV during the 1950s.\nProgrammes\nThese were some of the shows heard in 1935 as listed in the 3 May edition of Radio Pictorial:\nSundays:",

Williams soon left the station and Everitt found himself in charge of a small on-air staff of three women and one man. Because of the dearth of advertising available in English, the early morning shows on long wave quickly disappeared and made way for French-language programmes. More contractions followed and this led to cuts in more of the morning, afternoon and evening programming in English.\nBy the start of the 1950s, sponsorship of the English service had begun to grow once more, and while initially some of the English-language programmes continued via Radio Luxembourg I on long wave, a second but less powerful wavelength was opened up as Radio Luxembourg II on medium wave. The English programmes of Radio Luxembourg moved on 2 July 1951, from long wave to the medium wave frequency of 208 metres (1439 kHz). The controversy over the station's broadcasting frequencies had been resolved with the 1948 Copenhagen plan (which this time the Luxembourg government did sign), which allocated the country two high-power frequencies, one on long wave and the other on medium wave.

A British company, Radio Luxembourg (London) Ltd, controlled the programme content and sold the advertising time.\nThe station sign-on time at dusk varied between summer and winter to allow maximum benefit to be gained from a skywave propagation at night that covered the British Isles, although reception was strongest in northern England. By restricting the service to night-time, the sales representatives were able to sell most of the available airtime both for spot commercials and for sponsored programmes. One spot commercial that became burned into the minds of every Radio Luxembourg listener was for Horace Batchelor's  Infra-Draw Method  of winning money on football pools, turning the previously obscure Somerset town of  Keynsham, spelt K-E-Y-N-S-H-A-M  into a household name throughout the country.\nSome programmes were live disc-jockey presentations by the team of  resident announcers  from the studios in Luxembourg City, while others were pre-recorded in the company's British studios at 38 Hertford",

Radio Caroline's opening announcement identified it as  Your all-day music station    a clear reference both to Luxembourg's night-time-only broadcasts, and to the BBC's patchy pop music coverage.

The first song played was  Not Fade Away  by the Rolling Stones, which could be interpreted as a dig at Luxembourg's fluctuating signal strength.\nIn Caroline's primary reception areas, her ground wave signal was strong and unaffected during daylight hours by fading or interference. Following the success of this first offshore station, others soon followed, mostly broadcasting from off the Essex coast or in the Thames Estuary. These transmissions were later extended around the clock and featured many different broadcasting formats, though pop music on discs predominated.\nAs a result of this competition, Radio Luxembourg gradually abandoned pre-recorded sponsored programmes for a more flexible continuity. Its new format featured mainly spot advertising within record programmes presented live by resident disc jockeys in Luxembourg, some of them recruited from the offshore stations.\nIn August 1967, the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act passed into British law, and forced all but the two Caroline stations off the air by eliminating their means of selling commercial advertising in the UK. As well as closing down offshore  pirate radio , the British government instructed the BBC to create its own non-commercial replacement, named Radio 1, which began transmissions at the end of September 1967.

Under good weather conditions, and especially at night, people as far as eastern Czechoslovakia, Poland, Estonia, Lithuania, Belarus, Leningrad and Moscow could listen to the station. Eastern Bloc governments did not use jammers to prevent people from listening to Radio Luxembourg, but did do so for Radio Free Europe and, since the stations used harmonic frequencies (1439 kHz for Luxembourg and 719 kHz for Free Europe), the jamming also affected Radio Luxembourg's signal. Even though western popular music was considered undesirable by socialist regimes, legal prosecution was rare, although not unheard of. The music appealed to young people as something forbidden, and listening to it became a social ritual. It also strongly influenced contemporary underground culture and music in Czechoslovakia.\nSee also\nRadio Luxembourg (DRM)   broadcasting for a few years commencing 2005\nRadio Luxembourg (disambiguation)   other language services\nRTL (French radio)   French-language station\nRTL Radio   German-language station\nTimeline of Radio Luxembourg\nReferences\nSpecific citations\nGeneral references\nExternal links\nOfficial website on the history of the English service of Radio Luxembourg\nRadio Luxembourg The Last Day of 208 (streaming)",

    "text": " ray-finned fish, a butterflyfish belonging to the family Chaetodontidae. It is found in the southwestern Indian Ocean and the extreme southwestern Atlantic Ocean off southern Africa.\nDescription\nThe doublesash butterflyfish has a silvery-white body marked with three broad yellowish-brown vertical bands, another one runs through the eyes, and there is a similar coloured caudal peduncle. The caudal fin has a yellow band while the dorsal and anal fins are yellow. The dorsal fin contains 11 spines and 23-24 soft rays while the anal fin has 3 spines and 18-19 soft rays. This species attains a maximum total length of 20 centimetres (7.9 in).\nDistribution\nThe doublesash butterflyfish is found off Southern Africa from Delagoa Bay in Mozambique to Lambert's Bay on the Atlantic coast of Western Cape Province in South Africa.\nHabitat and biology\nThe doublesash butterflyfish can be found on both rock and coral reefs, as well as in estuaries. They may be found at depths of up to 120 metres (390 ft). This is an oviparous species which forms pairs for spawning. This species is omnivorous and feeds on macroalgae, as well as benthic invertebrates such as polychaetes, crustaceans, hydroids and ascidians.\nSystematics\nThe doublesash butterflyfish was first formally described in 1921 by the English ichthyologist Charles Tate Regan (1878-1943) with the type locality given as East London. Regan honoured the collector of the type, the Natal fisheries officer Harold Walter Bell-Marley (1872-1945), in the specific name. Its closest relative is the West African Chaetodon hoefleri. Some authorities place this species within the nominate subgenus Chaetodon but others consider it to be incertae sedis.\n   References",

He taught at the University of Giessen, where he is known to have supervised 30 doctorates.\nWorks\nIn 1882, Pasch published a book, Vorlesungen über neuere Geometrie, calling for the grounding of Euclidean geometry in more precise primitive notions and axioms, and for greater care in the deductive methods employed to develop the subject. He drew attention to a number of heretofore unnoted tacit assumptions in Euclid's Elements. He then argued that mathematical reasoning should not invoke the physical interpretation of the primitive terms, but should instead rely solely on formal manipulations justified by axioms.

Booth was a Canadian lumber baron known for creating Canada's largest sawmill right in Ottawa, near Chaudière Falls. His mill's capacity exceeded the distribution infrastructure, and he looked to rail as a solution. (Eighteen years previous, he had established the Canada Atlantic Railway.) Booth had built a central depot in 1895 just south of Rideau Street, on the east side of the canal and reachable by way of a covered stairway from Sappers Bridge. The station seemed to not be truly serving the needs of the railway companies, since it was built for the interests of the Canada Atlantic Railway.\nCPR's Royal Alexandra Interprovincial Bridge built in 1901 became the second railway bridge to cross the Ottawa River between Ottawa and Hull. It led to Booth's central depot. In 1905, Booth sold the Canada Atlantic Railway to the Grand Trunk Railway.\nIn 1910, the Grand Trunk was apportioned part of the Rideau Canal in order to build a new station and hotel. The hotel would become the famous Chateau Laurier, and the station would become Ottawa's Union Station.\nConstruction of Union Station\nThe building was opened by the Grand Trunk Railway in 1912 as Ottawa's central railway station",

A tunnel under Rideau Street links the station and the hotel. Over the course of the following years, passenger services of other railways moved to this station, thereby clarifying and unifying passenger travel in the city. When the last Canadian Pacific trains moved from the old Union Station on Broad Street to Grand Trunk Central station on January 4, 1920, the old station was closed and the Grand Trunk station became Ottawa Union Station.\nThe June 1912 opening of the Union Station and the Chateau Laurier was not met with much fanfare, since Grand Trunk Railway general manager Charles Melville Hays had just perished in the Titanic disaster two months previously.\nThe Doric Roman Revival multi pillar Union station was originally designed by New York-based architect Bradford Lee Gilbert who was eventually dismissed due to concerns of mismanagement. The Montreal firm of Ross and MacFarlane took over the project, making many design changes to the station.

They approached Union Station through several sheds. From the sheds, emerged two tracks (on the east side of the Rideau Canal), and continued along, proceeding under the bridge where Wellington Street crosses the canal. They then ran immediately adjacent to the west side of Chateau Laurier, in a structure which was used for a time in a converted form, by the Canadian Museum of Contemporary Photography. The track continued, where there is now a paved road and ran to the Alexandra (Interprovincial) Bridge.\nOnce in Hull, there was the possibility to continue to other parts of Quebec, or to return to Ottawa by making a turn and returning over the Prince of Wales Bridge. Some of the pathways in present-day Gatineau are on locations where rails had once made this possible.\nPost 1966\nIn 1966, the National Capital Commission decided to remove the tracks along the east side of the Canal as part of an urban renewal plan.

They were replaced by a scenic drive, and a new Ottawa station was built just east of Ottawa's downtown area in the neighbourhood of Eastway Gardens. While the NCC had originally planned to tear down the structure, it was spared, becoming the centre of Canada's centennial celebrations in 1967. After sitting empty for many years, it was turned into the Government Conference Centre. A new entrance and canopy at the rear of the building was built to provide greater security for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting held in 1973. The same year, artist Bruce Garner sculpted bronze doors for the new entrance, titled Reflections of Canada. The tracks and sheds south of the station were demolished and now taken over by Colonel By Drive and the Rideau Centre.\nIt had since been home to many gatherings of civil servants and politicians. In 1981, a pivotal meeting of federal justice minister Jean Chrétien and provincial justice ministers Roy McMurtry and Roy Romanow in the kitchen of the conference centre struck what was called the  Kitchen Accord  about the patriation of the Constitution of Canada.

A section of the Berlin Wall was on display inside the main entrance from September 27, 1991, until January 29, 2011. Because the location of the display was not widely publicized, it was decided that the segment would be more prominent at its new location in the Canadian War Museum.\nArchitecture\nThe building is inspired by the Beaux-Arts architectural style. The main departures hall (now the main conference area) is based on the Great Hall of the Roman Baths of Caracalla at 3 4 scale.

It is seen as being feasible to do so (although it would require a long tunnel to reconnect to the existing railway tracks) ; however, the Government of Canada's Department of Public Works says the building is not for sale.\nTemporary Senate of Canada building\nIn July 2013, it was announced by Public Works Canada that the building would be used to temporarily accommodate the Senate chamber (in the main concourse of the old train station) along with 21 Senate offices and three committee rooms (in the old general waiting room) while the Centre Block undergoes major rehabilitation work projected to take up to ten years. It was decided that the need to rehabilitate this historical building presented a perfect opportunity to find an interim home for the Senate. The works included:\nseismic reinforcement;\nrestoration of the masonry;\nreplacement of roofing materials including skylights, replacement of obsolete electrical, mechanical and life safety systems to meet current codes;\nrenovation of the interior space;\nremoval of outdated conference amenities added in the 1960s (i.e. translation booths);\nconformity to universal accessibility requirements;\nabatement of hazardous materials; and\nexpansion of the loading dock, to improve serviceability limitations of the building.\nIn February 2019, the Senate of Canada Building formally re-opened in its current role.\nSee also\nOttawa station, the station opened in 1966 to replace Ottawa Union Station\nReferences\nExternal links\nSenate of Canada Building on the Senate of Canada website\nNCC Watch: Ottawa Union Station\nThe Railways of Ottawa - Colin Churcher's Railway Pages",

Lyrics are credited to  Vera Matson  (though the actual lyricist was her husband, Ken Darby). The melody is identical to the sentimental Civil War ballad  Aura Lea  (sometimes spelled  Aura Lee ) by the Englishman George R. Poulton. The RCA Victor recording by Elvis Presley was No. 1 on both the Billboard and Cashbox charts in 1956.\nHistory\nThe 1956 song  Love Me Tender  puts new words to a new musical adaptation of the Civil War song  Aura Lea , published in 1861.  Aura Lea  had music by George R. Poulton and words by W. W. Fosdick. It later became popular with college glee clubs and barbershop quartets. It was also sung at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York.\nThe principal writer of the lyrics was Ken Darby who also adapted Poulton's Civil War tune, which was in the public domain. The song was published by Elvis Presley Music. and credited to Presley and Darby's wife Vera Matson.

Presley received co-songwriting credit due to his Hill   Range publishing deal which demanded songwriters concede 50 percent of the credit of their song if they wanted Presley to record it; Presley had songwriting input on only a very small number of the many songs he recorded. For  Love Me Tender  he wrote two lines but did not remember which ones. Darby was often asked about his decision to credit the song to his wife along with Presley, and his standard response was an acid,  because she didn't write it either . In actuality, Ken Darby wasn't credited because he was represented by another musicians association.\nAs with nearly all his early RCA recordings, Presley took control in the studio despite not being credited as producer. He would regularly change arrangements and self-produced years before other artists were known as producers. Ken Darby described Elvis Presley's role in the recording of the song:\nHe adjusted the music and the lyrics to his own particular presentation. Elvis has the most terrific ear of anyone I have ever met. He does not read music, but he does not need to. All I had to do was play the song for him once, and he made it his own! He has perfect judgment of what is right for him. He exercised that judgment when he chose 'Love Me Tender' as his theme song.\nElvis Presley performed  Love Me",

He exercised that judgment when he chose 'Love Me Tender' as his theme song.\nElvis Presley performed  Love Me Tender  on The Ed Sullivan Show on September 9, 1956, shortly before the single's release and about a month before the movie, Love Me Tender, was released (for which the reworded song had been written). After that, RCA received more than a million advance orders, making it a gold record before it was even released. The studio, 20th Century Fox, originally wanted to call the movie The Reno Brothers, but instead re-titled it Love Me Tender to capitalize on the song's popularity.\nMovie producer David Weisbart would not allow Presley's regular band (Scotty Moore, Bill Black, and D. J. Fontana) to play on the soundtrack. Instead, The Ken Darby Trio provided the musical backing with Red Robinson on drums, Charles Prescott on bass, Vita Mumolo on guitar, and Jon Dodson on background vocals, with Presley providing only lead vocals.\nElvis Presley recording\nThe single debuted at No. 2 on the  Best Sellers in Stores  pop singles chart, the first time a single made its first appearance at the No. 2 position.\nThe song hit No. 1 on the Billboard charts the week ending November 3, 195",

It is known as a birdwatching site, and there are several bird hides.\nMoors pools\nThe Moors pools, in the north, are freshwater lakes where there was once agricultural land. A range of wildfowl can be seen here, and it is a breeding place for species including black-headed gull, oystercatcher, lapwing and Cetti's warbler. Snipe and water rail can be seen in winter.\nThe Flashes\nThe Flashes, in the south, are saline pools in areas where brine extraction caused subsidence. There are plants typical of a salt marsh. Species of waders, both breeding and passage birds, may be seen. Scarce species have been spotted, such as ruff, sanderling, turnstone and whimbrel.\nLinks and biodiversity\nThe Trust believes that links between areas of countryside are beneficial for biodiversity; it notes that this reserve is next to the Forest of Feckenham Living Landscape area, and is a link between the Droitwich Canal wetlandsrel.\nLinks and biodiversity\nThe Trust believes that links between areas of countryside are beneficial for biodiversity; it notes that this reserve is next to the Forest of Feckenham Living Landscape area, and is a link between the Droitwich Canal wetlands, the Worcester and Birmingham Canal, the River Salwarpe and the River Severn.\nReferences\nExternal links\nThe Christopher Cadbury Wetland Reserve at Upton Warren Leaflet by Worcestershire Wildlife Trust",

    "text": "The Broselow Tape, also called the Broselow pediatric emergency tape, is a color-coded length-based tape measure that is used throughout the world for pediatric emergencies. The Broselow Tape relates a child's height as measured by the tape to their weight to provide medical instructions including medication dosages, the size of the equipment that should be used, and the level of energy when using a defibrillator. Particular to children is the need to calculate all these therapies for each child individually. In an emergency, the time required to do this detracts from valuable time needed to evaluate, initiate, and monitor patient treatment. The Broselow Tape is designed for children up to approximately 12 years of age who have a maximum weight of roughly 36 kg (79 lb). The Broselow Tape is recognized in most medical textbooks and publications as a standard for the emergency treatment of children.\nUsage\nTo use the Broselow Tape effectively, the child must be lying down. Use one hand to hold the red end of the tape, so it is even with the child's head. (Remember:  red to head ). While maintaining one hand on the red portion at the top of the child's head, use your free hand to run the tape down the length of the child's body until it is even with their heels (not toes). The tape that is level with the child's heels will provide their approximate weight in kilograms and their color zone.\nAs the tape is not completely accurate, care is required with",

The tape that is level with the child's heels will provide their approximate weight in kilograms and their color zone.\nAs the tape is not completely accurate, care is required with its use.\nAccuracy\nThe Broselow Tape is based on the relationship between weight and length; each color zone estimates the 50th percentile weight for length, which for practical purposes estimates the ideal body weight (IBW) for emergency dosing. Because of the recent obesity epidemic, concerns have been raised as to the accuracy of the tape to determine acceptable weights and subsequently acceptable doses of emergency medications.\nThe most recent version of the Broselow Tape incorporates updated length weight zones based on the most current National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data set. Utilizing this data set to examine Broselow Tape predictions of actual body weight with the revised zones reveals that approximately 65  of the time the patient's measured length places them in the correct zone for actual weight. Of the remaining 35 ,  20  fall into the heavier Broselow-Luten zone above and 13  fall into the lighter zone below, with   1  outliers falling greater than 1 zone from predicted. If the healthcare provider incorporates a visual estimate of body habitus into the prediction, the accuracy of the estimate of actual patient weight is improved, as confirmed in multiple studies. Specifically, for drug dosing, the patient's length-based dosing zone can be adjusted up",

Specifically, for drug dosing, the patient's length-based dosing zone can be adjusted up one color zone if the child appears overweight. Thus, incorporating a visual estimate of whether the child is overweight provides a simple method to predict actual patient weight that appears to be clinically relevant given the rise in obesity in the U.S.\nAlthough some medications are best dosed by actual body weight (e.g., succinylcholine), most resuscitation medications are distributed in lean body mass (e.g., epinephrine, sodium bicarbonate, calcium, magnesium, etc.) so that IBW as accurately predicted by length, not the actual body weight, would appear preferable for dosing. For most resuscitation medications, the optimal dose is not known, and doses based on IBW or actual weight are likely equally effective.\nThe PALS guidelines comment on this issue:  There are no data regarding the safety or efficacy of adjusting the doses of resuscitation medications in obese patients. Therefore, regardless of the patient s habitus, use the actual body weight for calculating initial resuscitation drug doses or use a body length tape with pre-calculated doses. \nStudies on the accuracy of predicting endotracheal tube sizes consistently demonstrate the superiority of length predictions over other methods.

In 2012, a study with 572 enrolled subjects published that paramedic Broselow measurements correlated well with both scale and ED measurements, underscoring its utility in the prehospital setting. There are debates about accuracy in actual weight estimation and its relevance as noted above. The tape is still considered by some to be the best tool for predicting actual body weight.\nDesign\nThe original Broselow tape was divided into 2.5 kg (5.5 lb) zones for medication doses and eight color zones for equipment selection. Subsequent versions of the tape combined dosing and equipment zones such that the eight color zones contained both dosing and equipment information, thus creating a simple visual system for medication and equipment which is used in most hospitals and ambulances.\nThe following list identifies which color zones correlate with each estimated weight zone in kilograms (kg) and pounds (lb).\nHistory\nEmergency physicians James Broselow and Robert Luten struggled with solving these issues related to the emergency treatment of children in the early 1980s.

The result was the invention by Broselow of a home-made prototype version of the tape in 1985. Broselow joined with Luten, an academic physician from the University of Florida and member of the newly formed pediatric advanced life support subcommittee, to do the foundational studies upon which the tape was based and to develop and update the tape over the years.\nThe tape provides pre-calculated medication doses, effectively eliminating the potential errors associated with pediatric emergent dosing preparation and administration. This benefit has had major implications in recent years, given the prevalence and magnitude of medication errors. Medical errors are a greater threat to children than adults because their organs are smaller and still developing. An estimated 35  of pediatric patients are incorrectly dosed by EMS providers. Tenfold mathematical errors due to incorrect calculations are a much greater threat to children than adults. Due to the high level of incorrect calculation errors, alternative pediatric emergency tapes Archived 2019-01-20 at the Wayback Machine that can be customized have gained popularity. A tenfold adult overdose of a standard adult medication would require multiple syringes and tends, therefore, to be obvious to a caregiver, effectively warning of the error. In contrast, for a small child both a 1x correct dose and a 10x overdose of a drug can be administered in the same syringe, thus providing, therefore, to be obvious to a caregiver, effectively warning of the error. In contrast, for a small child both a 1x correct dose and a 10x overdose of a drug can be administered in the same syringe, thus providing no clue as to a potential error. Furthermore, pediatric emergency care is especially prone to error due to the chaotic nature and stress associated with the emergency setting.\n   References",

One of the tasks Kidde opted to arrange for the railroad was to dieselize their locomotive roster to reduce their operating costs. In 1941, the NYS W placed an order for six S-2s from ALCO, and they were able to do so during World War II, since the War Production Board limited production for road locomotives, but allowed switcher production to continue on.\nThe six S-2s were delivered to the NYS W in March and April 1942. As part of a new diesel-numbering system that was implemented on the NYS W, the even-numbered S-2s (Nos. 202, 204, 206, and 208) were equipped with multiple-unit controls, while the odd-numbered S-2s (Nos. 203 and 205) were equipped without.\nRevenue service\nS-2 No. 206 was delivered to the NYS W in April 1942, and it began serving as a switcher for the railroad's branch lines and yards throughout New Jersey.

Some months later, No. 206 suffered an engine failure, and it had to be removed from service for repairs. Simultaneously, the NYS W began to purchase a fleet of EMD SD45s, and due to the SD45s' superior reliability, the NYS W reluctantly decided to retire all of their remaining ALCO locomotives, including No. 206.\nRetirement and display\nIn 1988, the NYS W traded No. 206 to General Electric (GE) for an order of four GE Dash 8-40Bs. The following year, GE donated No. 206 to the United Railroad Historical Society (URHS) for inclusion in their proposed museum. Throughout the 1990s, the URHS occasionally towed No. 206 to various railroad locations for special events, but by the end of the decade, they left it in undisclosed storage at the Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE G) station in Ridgefield Park.\nIn 2006, the Maywood Station Historical Committee (MSHC), a division of the NYS W",

Service Squadron Four consisted of nine logistic support ships assigned the vital mission of providing food, fuel, supplies, repair parts and ammunition to Naval units of the Second and Sixth Fleets. In this capacity Sylvania assumed the duties of deployed, on-station combat stores ship in early 1980, again from May through November 1981, in 1983 where the ship received the Navy Expeditionary Medal for her participation in Sixth Fleet peacekeeping efforts in Lebanon, again over the Winter of 1983 and early 1984, and in late 1984.\nIn 1985 Sylvania went through a major overhaul in Norfolk, Virginia in which all of its systems were upgraded and much needed repairs made. This put her out of the deployment rotation for over a full year. During this period USNS Sirius (T-AFS-8) was upgraded to be able to conduct full operations as a combat stores ship and was included in the Fleet AFS rotation. In 1986, Sylvania successfully left overhaul and conducted replenishment operations and refresher training in the Caribbean. This included training operations at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base",

In 1863 his family moved to Carleton where they opened a cotton spinning and weaving mill which operated for about 60 years, Slingsby was directly involved in the running of the Carleton Mill and was a partner from 1897 until his retirement in 1909.\nClimbing in Norway\nSlingsby first visited Norway in 1872 and fell in love with the country. He has been called the discoverer of the Norwegian mountains, and the father of Norwegian mountaineering (insofar as he seems to be the first who actively pursued climbing in Norway and was the first person on several mountains). Together with Norway's early skilled mountain climber Kristian Bing (1862 1935), he is considered to have been a pioneer explorer of Jostedalsbreen, the largest glacier in continental Europe. In 1874 he met the Norwegian Emanuel Mohn and a friendship developed between them, Mohn's vast local topographical knowledge of the Norwegian mountains and Slingsby's mountaineering experience led to an extensive mountaineering campaign together.\nSlingsby made the first ascent of numerous peaks in Norway including  Storen , or Store Skagastølstind (7,890 feet (2,405 m)), the third highest peak in Norway, which he climbed",

At the time, it was considered impossible to climb, but Slingsby defied popular notion and climbed the mountain, for the last part alone. Slingsby also attempted to climb the 1392 metres tall and highly steep Stetind in Narvik, but his attempt ended up as a failure, as he never made it to the peak. Slingsby would later describe this mountain as the ugliest one he had ever seen. His crossing of the 5,800-foot (1,800 m) Keiser Pass, Norway, on skis in 1880 also helped inspire the sport of ski mountaineering.\nHe also spoke and wrote strongly about several other mountains for example Slogen. His classic book on climbing in Norway, Norway, the Northern Playground, was first published in 1904 and republished in 1941. A new edition was released in 2003. The latest edition was published in March 2014.

Ohno created all these works as part of his hobby, many done in his spare time, in off-days, between performances with his group, or acting break moments. When the exhibition opened, Ohno said  It's a strange feeling to have so many people see the work that I have been making for 10 years in such... big venue . A companion book, also named  Freestyle , was released days before, on February 8, and by the time the exhibition opened, it was already on its third printing.\nIn May, the exhibition changed name to  Freestyle All Around Japan , opening in Osaka (Kyocera Dome Osaka 9F Sky Hall, May 14 18), Nagoya (Asunal Hall,",

In just the first day, the exhibition hosted 1,600 people, and by the day before, over 24,000 advance tickets had been sold.

From these past works, to the latest ones, FREESTYLE 2020 is packed with my latest thoughts and ideas. I hope everyone will find something to enjoy there . The exhibition contained from miniature paintings, to a large head sculpture, to the painting of what would become Arashi's single  Kite  cover image. Later that year, it was revealed that the exhibition would be taken to the virtual world. Held on December 11, Ohno would take the digital visitors on a tour looking around through his works. It was also revealed that the physical exhibition would take place in Osaka's Grand Front Osaka, from December 21 to February 28, 2021, exclusively for members of Arashi's fan club, with projects and new goods unique to the Osaka venue.\nAs with the previous two events, a companion book was released by the time of the opening of the exhibition. The book ranked first in the  Oricon Weekly Book Ranking  dated October 19, after selling 40,000 units the first week of sales.\nIn addition to the exhibition, this year's event also had another thing close to Ohno's heart. It had been a dream of his to become a baker, and this year, in  Cafe The Sun , the café located next to the exhibition venue, a  bakery  was installed for the duration of the event, under the name  Satoshi's Curry Bread Bakery . The bakery offered curry bread with Ohno's original curry recipe. The recipe written on a recipe card was also enclosed with the purchase inside the paper bag as a bonus.\nReferences\nExternal links\nFreestyle 2020 Tokyo City View Roppongi Hills page",

He notes his guilt in thievery, having vowed to never steal again after the death of his mother ( Proud of Your Boy ).\nMeanwhile, in the palace of Agrabah, Princess Jasmine is scolded by her father, the Sultan, for refusing yet another suitor. The Sultan demands that Jasmine must marry a noble prince before her birthday, which is only three days away. Jasmine laments the situation to her handmaidens ( These Palace Walls ). This news also disturbs the Sultan's Grand Vizier, Jafar, who wishes to usurp the throne himself. He and his assistant, Iago, search for a way to enter the  Cave of Wonders , a mysterious cavern in the desert said to hold untold power.

Aladdin has no idea who she is, but he is immediately smitten. After a brief scuffle with the guards, he takes Jasmine to his hideout, where they each reveal their unhappiness in their own lives ( A Million Miles Away ). They are discovered by the guards and Jasmine is escorted back to the palace. Aladdin is ordered to be killed, but he is saved by Jafar and Iago, who lead Aladdin to the Cave of Wonders ( Diamond in the Rough ).

Aladdin initially shrugs this off in disbelief, prompting the Genie to display his powers with a musical number ( Friend Like Me ). The Genie then reveals that he has limitations to his powers. He can not grant wishes that include murder, romance, the revival of the dead, or wishing for additional wishes. Amused and overjoyed at his good fortune, Aladdin tricks Genie into magically freeing them from the cave without actually using a wish; thereafter, Genie states that Aladdin will not receive any more magic help unless he explicitly states  I wish . After Aladdin asks what Genie would wish for, Genie muses that he would wish for freedom since he is a prisoner of his lamp, so Aladdin promises to use his last wish to free Genie.

Aladdin courts Jasmine with a ride on his magic carpet provided to him by Genie ( A Whole New World ). Once they return, Jasmine recognizes Aladdin as the young man whom she met in the marketplace. Aladdin lies and says that he really is a prince, he just sometimes likes to dress as a commoner to escape the pressures of palace living, much like Jasmine did that day.

Charles Isherwood of The New York Times was mostly positive in his review, writing that  this latest musical adapted from one of Disney's popular movies ... defied my dour expectations. As directed and choreographed  by  Nicholaw, and adapted by ... Beguelin, Aladdin has an infectious and only mildly syrupy spirit. Not to mention enough baubles, bangles and beading to keep a whole season of RuPaul's Drag Race contestants in runway attire.  Marilyn Stasio of Variety gave the show a negative review, commenting:  The magic-carpet ride is magical. The Cave of Wonders is wonderful. And yes, you'll hear the tunes you loved in the 1992 movie. But the notion that Disney Aladdin somehow resurrects the spirit of the late Howard Ashman, who had the original inspiration for the movie and contributed most of its clever lyrics, is a joke. Restoring a person's work without respecting his artistic sensibility is no tribute at all. \nAwards and nominations\nOriginal Broadway production\nOriginal London production\nOriginal Australian production\nSee also\nAladdin (franchise)\nAladdin Jr.: another stage adaptation of Aladdin, made specially for youth theatre.\nTwisted: A musical parody of Aladdin, telling the story from Jafar's perspective.\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website \n Aladdin  at the Internet Broadway Database\n Aladdin  at the Playbill Vault (archive)",

He is a Republican.\nLife and career\nGreenspan is a graduate of Troy University, where he majored in business and accounting. His career has been in communications and broadcasting, including with Atlanta Olympic Broadcasting, Turner Media Consultants, and the PGA TOUR Radio Network. Currently, Greenspan owns a small consulting agency focusing on start-up ventures.\nPrior to moving to Cuyahoga County, Greenspan resided in Sandy Springs, Georgia, where he sat on their inaugural city council. He also sat on the inaugural Cuyahoga County Council, where he was chairman of the finance committee. He was elected in 2010 and again in 2014.\nOhio House of Representatives\nLong-serving state representative Nan Baker was term-limited in 2016 after four terms, leaving a potentially competitive district open. With Greenspan representing exactly the same territory on the county council, he opted to seek to the Republican nomination for the seat.\nThe race was deemed one of the most competitive of the cycle, with Democrat Tommy Greene raising considerable money and receiving numerous high-profile endorsements. However, in the end Greenspan kept the seat in the Republican column with a 56  to 44  win. He was re-elected in 2018 by defeating Democrat Cassimir Svigelj. In 2020, he was defeated by Democrat Monique Smith. The following spring, he began working as a lobbyist for the MetroHealth system.\nReferences\nExternal links\nCampaign website",

Zeligs to refer specifically to the postures taken by analysts in a psychoanalytic session.\nTherapists\nPsychoanalysis also describes as 'acting in' the process whereby the analyst brings his or her personal countertransference into the analytic situation - as opposed to the converse, the acting out of the patient's transference.\nThe result is generally agreed to produce a chaotic analytic situation which hampers therapeutic progress.\nThe term was used rather differently however by Carl Whitaker in the 1960s, so as to refer to the technique whereby therapists increase their involvement in a session in such a way as to ramp up the patient's anxiety for therapeutic ends.\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nAdam Blatner, Acting in (1996)\nPatrick Carnes, Don't Call It Love (1991)\nL.

It is located in the western part of Damascus, on Mount Mezzeh, north of Mezzeh neighborhood, next to Mount Qasioun, and overlooks the city. The main building covers 31,500 square metres (340,000 square feet). The entire plateau of Mount Mezzeh is part of the palace compound and is surrounded by a security wall and guard watchtowers. Near the façade of the building is a large fountain, with the palace itself largely consisting of empty rooms clad in Carrara marble.\nHistory\nBa'athist Syria (1985 2024)\nJapanese architect Kenzo Tange is credited with the design. He reputedly resigned from the project before construction of the palace began. The brass front gates were created by the noted Syrian metalwork artist Maurice Nseiri.\nThe palace premises cover about 510,000 square metres (5,500,000 square feet) and also includes a private presidential hospital and the headquarters of the Republican Guard. Hafez al-Assad commissioned the plans for the building in 1979.

On 27 October 1994, Bill Clinton met Hafez al-Assad at the palace to negotiate a peace plan between Syria and Israel.\nPost-Ba'athist Syria (2024 present)\nOn 8 December 2024, during Syrian opposition offensives, anti-Assad forces entered the palace. Bashar al-Assad fled Syria, seeking asylum in Russia, resulting in the fall of his regime. \nAs of April 2025 the palace is used for diplomatic functions by the Syrian transitional government. On 29 January 2025, the palace hosted the Syrian Revolution Victory Conference, attended by commanders of various armed revolutionary factions who fought for the Syrian opposition coalition against the deposed regime of Bashar al-Assad. Between 24 25 February 2025, the palace hosted the Syrian National Dialogue Conference as part of the Syrian caretaker government to pave the way for national unity following the fall of the Assad regime. On 29 March 2025, the Syrian transitional government was announced by Syrian president Ahmed al-Sharaa at a ceremony at the palace, in which the new ministers were sworn in and delivered speeches outlining their agendas.\nOn 2 May 2025, after the Syrian transitional government clashed with Druze militias south of Damascus, the Israeli Air Force fired missiles at parts of Mount Mezzeh and areas near the presidential palace. The airstrike was a  message  to al-Sharaa to halt his offensive against the Druze. On 16 July 2025, parts of Mount Mezzeh near the outskirts of Damascus were struck by the Israeli Air Force after the Syrian Army deployed soldiers to Suwayda, in an attempt to restore order in Suwayda, with relation to the 2025 Southern Syria clashes.\n   References",

The critique suggests that Moore's work is flawed, and his argument on the Old Guard is a dominant view of the political history of New South Wales that Moore has led. Moore himself has responded to the criticism and defended his work in the paper Superintendent Mackay and the Curious Case of The Vanishing Secret Army.\nAustralian sport history\nAndrew Moore has contributed to the historical field of Australian social sport mainly through his writings on Australian Rugby League, with also a brief contribution to the history of Australian motorsports. He has worked with the ASSH as a contributing writer and editor of their book Centenary Reflections: 100 years of Rugby League in Australia.\nMoore's specialisation in the field of Australian Rugby League history is mainly on the history of the North Sydney Bears. Moore's work The Mighty Bears!: A social history of North Sydney Rugby League details why the club has been so unsuccessful, as well as analysing the relationship of Australian Rugby League with the rise of the working class. Fellow Tom Brock lecturer Charles Little critically acclaimed this work on its exploration of how women were treated in the club and how the introduction of licences to sell liquor affected its working class demographic. Greg Mallory from the University of Queensland also reviewed the book, praising it for its reinterpretation of the club's history by discussing the impact of popular culture on the club.

Biden was more influential than most vice presidents due to his long Senate career and relationships with both members of Congress and politicians abroad.

Biden was noted for his one-liners during the campaign; in one debate he said of Republican candidate Rudy Giuliani,  There's only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, and a verb and 9 11. \nBiden had difficulty raising funds, struggled to draw people to his rallies, and failed to gain traction against the high-profile candidacies of Obama and Hillary Clinton. He never rose above single digits in national polls of the Democratic candidates. In the first contest on January 3, 2008, Biden placed fifth in the Iowa caucuses, garnering slightly less than one percent of the state delegates. He withdrew from the race that evening.\nDespite its lack of success, Biden's 2008 campaign raised his stature in the political world. In particular, it changed the relationship between Biden and Obama. Although they had served together on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, they had not been close: Biden resented Obama's quick rise to political stardom, while Obama viewed Biden as garrulous and patronizing.

On August 22, 2008, Obama announced that Biden would be his running mate. The New York Times reported that the choice reflected a desire for someone with foreign policy and national security experience. Others pointed out Biden's appeal to middle-class and blue-collar voters. Biden was officially nominated for vice president on August 27 at the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver.\nBiden's vice-presidential campaigning gained little media attention, as the press devoted far more coverage to the Republican nominee, Alaska governor Sarah Palin. Under instructions from the campaign, Biden kept his speeches succinct and tried to avoid offhand remarks. Privately, Biden's remarks frustrated Obama.  How many times is Biden gonna say something stupid? , he asked. Obama campaign staffers called Biden's blunders  Joe bombs  and kept Biden uninformed about strategy discussions, which irked Biden. Relations between the two campaigns became strained for a month, until Biden apologized to Obama and the two built a stronger partnership.\nIn September 2008, during",

On October 2, he participated in the vice-presidential debate with Palin at Washington University in St. Louis. Post-debate polls found that while Palin exceeded many voters' expectations, Biden had still won the debate overall. On November 4, Obama and Biden were elected.\nAs Biden was running for vice president, he was also running for reelection to the Senate, as permitted by Delaware law. Having been reelected to the Senate as well as the vice presidency, Biden made a point of not resigning from the Senate before he was sworn in for his seventh term in January 2009. He resigned from the Senate on January 15.\nFirst term (2009 2013)\nBiden's vice presidency succeeded the Vice presidency of Dick Cheney, which was controversial. Biden said he intended to eliminate some explicit roles assumed by George W. Bush's vice president, Dick Cheney, and did not intend to emulate any previous vice presidency.

Members of the Obama administration said Biden's role in the White House was to be a contrarian and force others to defend their positions. Rahm Emanuel, White House chief of staff, said that Biden helped counter groupthink. The Bidens maintained a relaxed atmosphere at their official residence in Washington, often entertaining their grandchildren, and regularly returned to their home in Delaware.\nBiden visited Kosovo in May and affirmed the U.S. position that its  independence is irreversible . Biden lost an internal debate to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton about sending 21,000 new troops to Afghanistan, but his skepticism was valued, and in 2009, Biden's views gained more influence as Obama reconsidered his Afghanistan strategy. Biden visited Iraq about every two months, becoming the administration's point man in delivering messages to Iraqi leadership about expected progress there. More generally, overseeing Iraq policy became Biden's responsibility. By 2012, Biden had made eight trips there, but his oversight of U.S. policy in Iraq receded with the exit of U.S. troops in 2011.\nBiden oversaw infrastructure spending from the Obama stimulus package intended to help counteract the ongoing recession.

The remark revived Biden's reputation for gaffes. Confronted with rising unemployment through July 2009, Biden acknowledged that the administration had  misread how bad the economy was , but maintained confidence the stimulus package would create many more jobs once the pace of expenditures picked up. A hot mic picked up Biden telling Obama that his signing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was  a big fucking deal  on March 23, 2010. Despite their different personalities, Obama and Biden formed a friendship, partly based around Obama's daughter Sasha and Biden's granddaughter Maisy, who attended Sidwell Friends School together.\nDue to the large Democratic majority in Congress, Biden became the first vice president since Dan Quayle to cast zero tie-breaking votes as President of the Senate.

He led the successful administration effort to gain Senate approval for the New START treaty. In December 2010, Biden's advocacy for a middle ground, followed by his negotiations with Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, were instrumental in producing the administration's compromise tax package that included a temporary extension of the Bush tax cuts. The package passed as the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010.\nObama delegated Biden to lead negotiations with Congress in March 2011 to resolve federal spending levels and avoid a government shutdown. The U.S. debt ceiling crisis developed over the next few months, but Biden's relationship with McConnell again proved key in bringing about a deal to resolve it, in the form of the Budget Control Act of 2011.

And quite frankly, I don't see much of a distinction beyond that.  Prior to Biden's statement on Meet the Press, the Obama administration endorsed civil unions, but not same-sex marriage. Biden's decision reportedly forced Obama's hand, pressuring Obama to accelerate his own public shift to support same-sex marriage.

In August 2016, Biden visited Serbia, where he met with the Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vučić and expressed condolences for civilian victims of the bombing campaign during the Kosovo War.

Biden issued a statement saying that the ruling reflected a principle that  all people should be treated with respect and dignity   and that all marriages, at their root, are defined by unconditional love.

The publication portrayed Biden as a blue-collar  average Joe , an affable  goofy uncle , a muscle car driver, an avid fan of 1980s hair metal, a raucous party animal, a shameless womanizer, a recidivist petty criminal, and a drug-dealing outlaw. The Onion briefly revived its fanciful version of Biden in 2019, but subsequently took its satirical coverage of him in a more critical and straightforward direction. Biden's character became one of The Onion's most popular features during the Obama presidency, garnering critical acclaim and a large readership. Despite the extreme differences between the fictional character and the real politician, The Onion was regarded as having a significant, mostly positive influence on Biden's public image. Commentators noted that the character likely reinforced public perceptions of Biden as a political figure with populist working-class appeal and a good-natured, easy-going disposition.\nTelevision\nJason Sudeikis portrayed Biden during the 2008 United States Presidential election and has since returned to the role numerous times.

He became the first president to turn 80 while in office. He began his presidency with majority support, but saw his approval ratings decline significantly throughout his presidency, in part due to public frustration over inflation, which peaked at 9.1  in June 2022 but dropped to 2.9  by the end of his presidency. Biden initially ran for re-election and, after the Democratic primaries, he became the party's presumptive nominee in the 2024 presidential election. After his poor performance in the first presidential debate, renewed scrutiny from across the political spectrum about his cognitive ability led him to ultimately withdraw from the race. Biden immediately endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him in his place as the party's presidential nominee. Harris subsequently became the Democratic nominee at the 2024 Democratic National Convention with Tim Walz as her running mate, but they subsequently lost the general election to Trump and JD Vance. Biden's administration is ranked favorably by historians and scholars, diverging from public assessments of his tenure.

The band had several independent releases before signing to Seattle record label Light In The Attic, and then had two more studio releases: The Blakes LP and Streets EP. After that they had two more independent releases in 2009: Lights On EP and Souvenir LP.\nOverview\nPrior to the band's conception, brothers Garnet and Snow Keim had busked around the country writing music in the late 1990s, ultimately leading them to Seattle, Washington. The band formed in 2001 when the Keim brothers met their future drummer, Bob Husak, in a local Seattle coffeehouse (Tully's). Named after a dream that bassist Snow Keim experienced involving an encounter with 18th-century English poet William Blake in a metal shop, The Blakes moved to Los Angeles and began their musical career, playing shows and living for nearly two years in a Days Inn Hotel. The band put out a string of self-released EPs and eventually moved back to Seattle. In 2005, The Blakes gained major exposure from their fourth release, Little Whispers, when Seattle radio station KEXP began playing and promoting their music. In 2006, the band released their self-titled LP and toured extensively. In the following year, the band signed to Seattle independent record label Light In the Attic.

Arare is also called kakimochi or mochi crunch in Hawaii where it was introduced in the 1900s.\nTypes\nThere are many different sizes, colors, and shapes of arare. Some are sweet, and others savory. One, called norimaki arare (nori meaning an edible seaweed in the form of a dried sheet; maki meaning roll shape) is wrapped with dried nori seaweed. Another, kaki no tane (柿の種), takes its name from its resemblance to a persimmon seed. (Kaki is Japanese for  persimmon .) Kaki no tane are often sold with peanuts, a combination called kakipī (かきピー). These are a popular snack to accompany Japanese beer.\nCulture\nJapanese typically consume arare to celebrate Hinamatsuri, the  doll festival  held on 3 March. The arare made during the festival are multicolored, in shades including pink, yellow, white, brown and light green. Regular arare can be bought throughout the year, but the colorful ones are only available around January to March in anticipation of Hinamatsuri.\nArare was brought to the U.S. by Japanese immigrants who came as plantation workers in the early 1900s. In Hawaii, the snack is often called kakimochi (fried rice paste). In Hawaii, it is popular to mix arare with popcorn (some people mix in furikake, too). The popular  Hurricane popcorn  includes both arare and furikake with the popcorn.\nSee also\nAgemochi\nMochi\nOlive no Hana, a blend of arare\nSenbei\nRengginang, Indonesian rice cracker\n   References",

A few weeks after, the band announced that they planned to release a new album, the first since 2001's  Viva Nueva!, of old material that had been left off previous releases and new material that the band was working on. The band recorded the album all through May and June at The Halo Studios in Westbrook, Maine. They then came back to WCYY to announce that they were to play at a WCYY Patio Show in July and premiered newly written song  Troublesome  and newly recorded fan favorite  Rock Like War . In late June, the band released a sampler of 12 songs from their new album, Light at the End, one of them being the later omitted  Last Night's Band . In early July, the final track list (minus the bonus track  Happy ) was posted on Bull Moose Music's website along with the cover art and a link to pre-order the album. The band released the album on July 24, 2007, to all ten Bull Moose Music stores across the state the day of a special in-store acoustic performance.\nMusical style and lyrics\nConsisting mainly of songs that the band had written in various eras of their pre-breakup career, Light at the End has one of the band's broadest and",

The album's opening song,  Rock Like War , has a mainly hard rock first half, although the song later abruptly switches into a lighter, more upbeat second section that is made possible by the band's addition of a two-part string section. The guest strings are also used heavily in the album's other hard rocker,  Oxygen . The band's third version of  Hardest Way Possible , a song that appeared in different versions on Rooms by the Hour and  Viva Nueva!, appears on the album in the form that the band said they always wanted to record it, beginning with a Mellotron playing the string harmony that appears later in the song. The horns are playing a new arrangement, having a sound reminiscent of 1960s Stax Volt. In all, the album has a much more toned down, less overly produced feel to it than the band's final pre-break-up release,  Viva Nueva!.\nLyrically, the album is mainly similar to other Rustic Overtones releases, with many songs, such as  Black Leather Bag  and  Carnival , telling the cryptic and often nonsensical stories of romantic situations.

Letter to the President , played with only bass guitar, guitar, xylophone and ukulele, is very much a departure from most of the band's other songs, as it has the most overtly political lyrics on the album and perhaps anything they have released before.  Light at the End  has mainly inspirational lyrics, saying that  all things they turn around , perhaps symbolizing the band's hopes that they will succeed now that they are back together.  Happy , a fan favorite that was left off  Viva Nueva, also implies the band's happiness with reuniting with its optimistic lyrics describing the band's friendship.\nAlbum art\nThe art for Light at the End is by the popular Portland artist Patrick Corrigan, the artist behind the band's artwork for their 1998 release Rooms by the Hour. The design is in black pencil, unlike the color artwork for Rooms by the Hour. The cover is of a cockroach with a frowning mask of Melpomene, the Muse of Tragedy, on its back inside a glass jar with its cover removed.

The route, signed east west, runs in a southeast northwest direction, connecting U.S. Route 97 north of Chemult with Interstate 5 south of Eugene. It links the Willamette Valley and Central Oregon, crossing the Cascade Range at Willamette Pass. OR 58 is generally a modern two-lane highway with a speed limit of 55 mph (88 km h), built through the Willamette National Forest in the 1930s.\nOR 58 is a designated freight route, forming one of several connections between I-5 and US 97, which leads back to I-5 at Weed, California. This is a popular alternate route for trucks on the I-5 corridor, avoiding the steep grades and winter closures of I-5 over Siskiyou Summit. The highway is also on the National Highway System, and is classified as an expressway southeast of Odell Lake. (US 97 is also classified as such south to the state line, and in California it is part of the Freeway and Expressway System.)

It heads due southeast from there, following the course of the Willamette River into the foothills of the Cascade Mountains. The highway passes several lakes, including Dexter Lake and Lookout Point Lake, and provides access to the town of Lowell. Further into the mountains, it passes through the cities of Oakridge and Westfir. It continues past Heckletooth Mountain and McCredie Springs, into the mountains up the Salt Creek canyon, to the summit of Willamette Pass, after which it descends into central Oregon. Oregon Route 58 terminates at an interchange with U.S. Route 97.\nOregon Route 58 is of high importance as a freight corridor.

It also is the preferred route to points further southeast, including Reno, Nevada. Finally, it is an important alternate route for traffic moving up and down the West Coast, as bad weather frequently closes Interstate 5 at the Siskiyou Summit during the winter. The Union Pacific Railroad I-5 Corridor main line through Oregon and California roughly follows OR 58 and US 97. While a rail line exists through Siskiyou Summit, it is difficult for trains to use even in good weather, due to an excessively steep grade, and is often uneconomical to use in winter weather. It is common for West Coast truck traffic to prefer OR 58 and US 97 to Interstate 5 for the same reason.\nTwo scenic byways the West Cascades Scenic Byway and the Cascade Lakes Scenic Byway intersect with OR 58.\nHistory\nBy the 1850s, Emigrant Pass, slightly south of OR 58's crossing at Willamette Pass, was being used by emigrants to the Oregon Territory as a way over the Cascades. In October 1853, a party of 1,500 was almost stranded at the pass, but was saved from a Donner Party-style tragedy by nearby settlers who had begun to improve the route up the Middle Fork Willamette River earlier that year as a shortcut between",

To finance the construction, the government offered land grants along the route. Eventually, the Oregon Central Military Wagon Road Company would build 420 miles (680 km) of road and claim about 806,400 acres (3,263 km2). However, scandal and lawsuits regarding the quality of the road and its route reduced the amount of land actually patented by the company to approximately 235,568 acres (953.31 km2). Today, Oregon Route 58 follows the first leg of the Oregon Central military road from Eugene over the Cascades to Central Oregon.\nThe Oregon State Highway Commission added the Willamette Highway No. 18, from Goshen via Oakridge to Crescent, to the state highway system on November 24, 1922.

The reservoir provides a source of water for the Canal du Midi. It was originally proposed in 1665 by the commission created by Louis XIV of France to evaluate Pierre-Paul Riquet's plan for the canal enterprise.\nThe original reservoir in support of the canal was at Bassin de St. Ferréol. In 1776 a link was provided between the canal and the Aude and the Canal de la Robine at Narbonne. This connection and an increase in barge traffic led to a requirement for more water.\nA short time after the dam was complete, leaks were found. They were stopped by pouring a large quantity of quick lime into the reservoir. The particles of lime thus suspended and were carried into the leaking areas and filled all the openings in the joints of masonry and even into the stone.\nThe feeder canal from the basin to the canal is 52,552m.\nThe basin covers some 24 hectares and contains some 1,600,000 cubic metres of water.

It is a part of the ethics of artificial intelligence and is closely related to machine ethics. While machine ethics is concerned with how an artificially intelligent agent should behave, friendly artificial intelligence research is focused on how to practically bring about this behavior and ensuring it is adequately constrained.\nEtymology and usage\nThe term was coined by Eliezer Yudkowsky, who is best known for popularizing the idea, to discuss superintelligent artificial agents that reliably implement human values. Stuart J. Russell and Peter Norvig's leading artificial intelligence textbook, Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, describes the idea:\nYudkowsky (2008) goes into more detail about how to design a Friendly AI. He asserts that friendliness (a desire not to harm humans) should be designed in from the start, but that the designers should recognize both that their own designs may be flawed, and that the robot will learn and evolve over time. Thus the challenge is one of mechanism design to define a mechanism for evolving AI systems under a system of checks and balances, and to give the systems utility functions that will remain friendly in the face of such changes.\n Friendly  is used in this context as technical terminology, and picks out agents that are safe and useful, not",

The concept is primarily invoked in the context of discussions of recursively self-improving artificial agents that rapidly explode in intelligence, on the grounds that this hypothetical technology would have a large, rapid, and difficult-to-control impact on human society.\nRisks of unfriendly AI\nThe roots of concern about artificial intelligence are very old. Kevin LaGrandeur showed that the dangers specific to AI can be seen in ancient literature concerning artificial humanoid servants such as the golem, or the proto-robots of Gerbert of Aurillac and Roger Bacon. In those stories, the extreme intelligence and power of these humanoid creations clash with their status as slaves (which by nature are seen as sub-human), and cause disastrous conflict. By 1942 these themes prompted Isaac Asimov to create the  Three Laws of Robotics  principles hard-wired into all the robots in his fiction, intended to prevent them from turning on their creators, or allowing them to come to harm.\nIn modern times as the prospect of superintelligent AI looms nearer, philosopher Nick Bostrom has said that superintelligent AI systems with goals that are not aligned with human ethics are intrinsically dangerous unless extreme measures",

He put it this way:\nBasically we should assume that a 'superintelligence' would be able to achieve whatever goals it has. Therefore, it is extremely important that the goals we endow it with, and its entire motivation system, is 'human friendly.'\nIn 2008, Eliezer Yudkowsky called for the creation of  friendly AI  to mitigate existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence. He explains:  The AI does not hate you, nor does it love you, but you are made out of atoms which it can use for something else. \nSteve Omohundro says that a sufficiently advanced AI system will, unless explicitly counteracted, exhibit a number of basic  drives , such as resource acquisition, self-preservation, and continuous self-improvement, because of the intrinsic nature of any goal-driven systems and that these drives will,  without special precautions , cause the AI to exhibit undesired behavior.\nAlexander Wissner-Gross says that AIs driven to maximize their future freedom of action (or causal path entropy) might be considered friendly if their planning horizon is longer than a certain threshold, and unfriendly if their planning horizon is shorter than that threshold.\n",

For instance, he suggests even an AI that only makes accurate predictions and communicates via a text interface might cause unintended harm.\nIn 2014, Luke Muehlhauser and Nick Bostrom underlined the need for 'friendly AI'; nonetheless, the difficulties in designing a 'friendly' superintelligence, for instance via programming counterfactual moral thinking, are considerable.\nCoherent extrapolated volition\nYudkowsky advances the Coherent Extrapolated Volition (CEV) model. According to him, our coherent extrapolated volition is  our wish if we knew more, thought faster, were more the people we wished we were, had grown up farther together; where the extrapolation converges rather than diverges, where our wishes cohere rather than interfere; extrapolated as we wish that extrapolated, interpreted as we wish that interpreted .\nRather than a Friendly AI being designed directly by human programmers, it is to be designed by a  seed AI  programmed to first",

The appeal to an objective through contingent human nature (perhaps expressed, for mathematical purposes, in the form of a utility function or other decision-theoretic formalism), as providing the ultimate criterion of  Friendliness , is an answer to the meta-ethical problem of defining an objective morality; extrapolated volition is intended to be what humanity objectively would want, all things considered, but it can only be defined relative to the psychological and cognitive qualities of present-day, unextrapolated humanity.\nOther approaches\nSteve Omohundro has proposed a  scaffolding  approach to AI safety, in which one provably safe AI generation helps build the next provably safe generation.\nSeth Baum argues that the development of safe, socially beneficial artificial intelligence or artificial general intelligence is a function of the social psychology of AI research communities and so can be constrained by extrinsic measures and motivated by intrinsic measures. Intrinsic motivations can be strengthened when messages resonate with AI developers; Baum argues that, in contrast,  existing messages about beneficial AI are not always framed well .

Baum advocates for  cooperative relationships, and positive framing of AI researchers  and cautions against characterizing AI researchers as  not want(ing) to pursue beneficial designs .\nIn his book Human Compatible, AI researcher Stuart J. Russell lists three principles to guide the development of beneficial machines. He emphasizes that these principles are not meant to be explicitly coded into the machines; rather, they are intended for the human developers. The principles are as follows:\nThe machine's only objective is to maximize the realization of human preferences.\nThe machine is initially uncertain about what those preferences are.\nThe ultimate source of information about human preferences is human behavior.\nThe  preferences  Russell refers to  are all-encompassing; they cover everything you might care about, arbitrarily far into the future.  Similarly,  behavior  includes any choice between options, and the uncertainty is such that some probability, which may be quite small, must be assigned to every logically possible human preference.\nPublic policy\nJames Barrat, author of Our Final Invention, suggested that  a public-private partnership has to be created to bring A.I.-makers together to share ideas about security something like the International Atomic Energy Agency, but in partnership with corporations.

He urges AI researchers to convene a meeting similar to the Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA, which discussed risks of biotechnology. \nJohn McGinnis encourages governments to accelerate friendly AI research. Because the goalposts of friendly AI are not necessarily eminent, he suggests a model similar to the National Institutes of Health, where  Peer review panels of computer and cognitive scientists would sift through projects and choose those that are designed both to advance AI and assure that such advances would be accompanied by appropriate safeguards.  McGinnis feels that peer review is better  than regulation to address technical issues that are not possible to capture through bureaucratic mandates . McGinnis notes that his proposal stands in contrast to that of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, which generally aims to avoid government involvement in friendly AI.\nCriticism\nSome critics believe that both human-level AI and superintelligence are unlikely and that, therefore, friendly AI is unlikely. Writing in The Guardian, Alan Winfield compares human-level artificial intelligence with faster-than-light travel in terms of difficulty and states that while we need to be  cautious and prepared  given the stakes involved, we  don't need to be obsessing  about the risks of superintelligence.

Boyles and Joaquin, on the other hand, argue that Luke Muehlhauser and Nick Bostrom's proposal to create friendly AIs appear to be bleak. This is because Muehlhauser and Bostrom seem to hold the idea that intelligent machines could be programmed to think counterfactually about the moral values that human beings would have had. In an article in AI   Society, Boyles and Joaquin maintain that such AIs would not be that friendly considering the following: the infinite amount of antecedent counterfactual conditions that would have to be programmed into a machine, the difficulty of cashing out the set of moral values that is, those that are more ideal than the ones human beings possess at present, and the apparent disconnect between counterfactual antecedents and ideal value consequent.\nSome philosophers claim that any truly  rational  agent, whether artificial or human, will naturally be benevolent; in this view, deliberate safeguards designed to produce a friendly AI could be unnecessary or even harmful. Other critics question whether artificial intelligence can be friendly. Adam Keiper and Ari N. Schulman, editors of the technology journal The New Atlantis, say that it will be impossible ever to guarantee  friendly  behavior in AIs because problems of ethical complexity will not yield to software advances or increases in computing power.

    "text": "The Getting of Wisdom is a novel by Australian novelist Henry Handel Richardson. It was first published in 1910, and has almost always been in print ever since.\nAuthor\nHenry Handel Richardson was the pseudonym of Ethel Florence Lindesay Richardson, a writer who was born in 1870 to a reasonably well-off family which later fell on hard times. The author's family lived in various Victorian towns and from the age of 13 to 17 Richardson attended boarding school at the Presbyterian Ladies' College in Melbourne, Victoria. It's this experience that feeds directly into The Getting of Wisdom.\nPlot\nSet in 1890s Melbourne, Australia, the novel revolves around 12 year old Laura Tweedle Rambotham, the eldest child of four children of a country family. She is a clever and highly imaginative child, given to inventing romantic stories for the entertainment of her younger siblings, and an avid reader. She is also both proud and sensitive and her mother finds her difficult to handle. Her mother is the widow of a barrister who supports her family in genteel poverty on her earnings from embroidery. At the age of 12 Laura is sent off to boarding school in Melbourne, Australia. Her experiences at school shock and humiliate the unworldly Laura. The girls at the school are generally from rather wealthy families and those, like Laura, who come from less fortunate backgrounds learn very early not to divulge their circumstances for fear of ridicule.

The girls at the school are generally from rather wealthy families and those, like Laura, who come from less fortunate backgrounds learn very early not to divulge their circumstances for fear of ridicule. From time to time Laura lets little snippets of information about her family slip out, and she suffers for it.\nLaura undergoes a form of redemption at the end of the book, convincing herself that cheating in an exam is actually God's will, and then later deciding that while she was wrong to do so, she got away with it and therefore God had no actual hand in the matter or else he would have punished her for the sin. At the end, when Laura is walking away from the school for the last time, she is overcome with a desire to run, and the last we see of her is a rapidly diminishing form disappearing through a park. She is free at last: free of the overwhelming constrictions of the school, the teachers' expectations and the other schoolgirls' callous disregard.\nNotes\nThe book carries the dedication:  To my unnamed little collaborator .\nThe epigraph reads: Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding. Proverbs, IV, 7.\nFilm adaptation\nIn 1978, the book was adapted for the screen in a film of the same name.

The attack was part of Operation Unokat which aimed to break the roadblocks set up by the gendarmerie by the end of November 1961 and at the same time stop Katangese President Moïse Tshombe's opposition to the UN. In a coordinated offensive, Swedish troops captured Camp Massart; Irish troops attacked the railway tunnel; the Indian contingent created diversionary attacks and blocked fleeing Katangese forces; and the Ethiopian forces secured the western part of the city.

The city surrendered on 14 September.\nBackground\nIn the Second Polish Republic, Przemyśl was an important military garrison, with the headquarters of 9th Military District of the Polish Army stationed here (commandant: General Wacław Scaevola-Wieczorkiewicz). Furthermore, Przemyśl was home to the 38th Lwów Rifles Infantry Regiment, which was part of the 24th Infantry Division.\nIn the first days of the German Invasion of Poland, the 24th Infantry Division remained in reserve of Polish Commander-in-Chief. On 3 September it was attached to Operational Group Jasło, part of Karpaty Army. The division was loaded on trains, and transported to Tarnów and Dębica. In the second week of September 1939, the frontline approached the San river, which was defended by troops of General Scaevola-Wieczorkiewicz. His forces, however, were inadequate to defend an extended line, in addition the water level in the river was very low due to hot and dry summer of 1939, and",

On 8 September General Kazimierz Fabrycy ordered preparation for the defence of Przemyśl. Polish forces in the city were commanded by General Jan Chmurowicz, his chief of staff was Major Michal Gulcz. Military commandant of Przemyśl was Colonel Mieczyslaw Sokol-Szahin.\nOn the night of 8 9 September, Polish soldiers manned two defensive lines. Two infantry battalions with 7 cannons defended the district of Zasanie, and their task was to keep their positions on nearby hills until forces of 11th Infantry Division, fighting the Wehrmacht near Dubiecko, reached the safety of the fortress. Second line of defence was temporarily manned by one infantry battalion. Road bridge over the San was ready to be blown up, while rail bridge was barricaded with freight cars and barbed wire.\nSince the beginning of the campaign, Przemyśl was bombed by the Luftwaffe.

MusicBrainz was founded due to the restrictions placed on the Compact Disc Database (CDDB), a database for software applications to look up audio CD information on the Internet. MusicBrainz has expanded its goals beyond serving as a CD metadata repository, evolving into a structured online database for music information, including details about artists, performers, and songwriters.\nMusicBrainz captures information about artists, their recorded works, and the relationships between them. Recorded works entries capture the album title, track titles, and the length of each track at a minimum. These entries are maintained by volunteer editors who follow community written style guidelines. Recorded works can also store information about release date and country, the CD ID, cover art, acoustic fingerprint, free-form annotation text and other metadata. As of May 2025, MusicBrainz contains information on over 2.6 million artists, 4.7 million releases, and 35.2 million recordings. End-users can use software that communicates with MusicBrainz to add metadata tags to their digital media files, such as ALAC, FLAC, MP3, Ogg Vorbis or AAC.\nImage archives\nCover Art Archive\nMusicBrainz allows contributors to upload cover art images of releases to the database; these images are hosted by Cover Art Archive (CAA), a joint project between Internet Archive and MusicBrain",

As with other contributions, the MusicBrainz community is in charge of maintaining and reviewing the data. Until May 16, 2022, cover art was also provided for items on sale at Amazon and some other online resources, but CAA is now preferred, because it gives the community more control and flexibility for managing the images.

A separate application, such as MusicBrainz Picard, is used to do this.\nProprietary services\nIn 2000, MusicBrainz started using Relatable's patented TRM (a recursive acronym for TRM Recognizes Music) for acoustic fingerprint matching. The popularity of this feature drew in a large user base to the platform, enabling the database to expand rapidly. By 2005, TRM was experiencing difficulties in handling the sheer volume of data, as the number of tracks stored in the database had surpassed one million. This issue was resolved in May 2006, when MusicBrainz partnered with MusicIP (now AmpliFIND), replacing TRM with MusicDNS. TRMs were phased out and replaced by MusicDNS in November 2008.\nIn October 2009, MusicIP was acquired by AmpliFIND.\nAcoustID and Chromaprint\nSince the future of the free identification service was uncertain, a replacement for it was sought.

On June 11, 1992, it was added to the United States National Register of Historic Places.\nHistory\nThe Armory building was constructed in 1939 in Art Deco style by architect William Manley King with Works Progress Administration (WPA) funds. It was occupied by the National Guard Armory from 1939 to 1982. During the 1950s and 1960s, the building was used for Palm Beach High School dances and other community events. In 1987, the Norton School of Art closed their doors, leaving 250 students and 40 faculty members without a location to hold art classes. Robert and Mary Montgomery heard about the lack of space for an art center and made a  100,000 donation to open the Robert and Mary Montgomery Armory Art Center. The Center opened in 1987 and has rented the building from Palm Beach County for  1 a year for the last 20 years.

In 1996, the company, which owned all residential property in the town, evicted all of its residents. The following year, because it had no residents, National City was dissolved by court order. Its site was subsequently annexed by nearby Fairmont City, Illinois.\nHistory\nBackground and context\nFollowing the American Civil War, the American economy began to undergo a dramatic change as smaller markets and operations were being replaced by more centralized and efficient ones. This was due in no small part to the advent of the railroads, which by this time crossed much of the country and connected previously isolated producers to one another in a more expedient fashion. This transformation of the nation s transportation network by railroads had a particularly strong impact on livestock-related industries. It eliminated the need for long cattle drives by connecting the producers of livestock (especially cattle) in the West with the major meat processing companies in the East. It also enabled livestock markets to become transregional, with animals being shipped to large, centralized markets for sale, processing and distribution. The result of this was that over time, smaller, localized markets became obsolete and a relatively small number of terminal livestock markets markets built near important railroad centers came to dominate the livestock and meatpacking industries. St. Louis, Missouri was a natural choice as one of these locations.\nSit",

St. Louis, Missouri was a natural choice as one of these locations.\nSituated near the juncture of the Missouri River and Mississippi River, the city of St. Louis had long been an important transportation center. Its access to these river systems coupled with its central location in the country had contributed to its becoming a major industrial center and railroad hub, with all the U.S. s major rail lines converging in the city and from there running to all the different regions of the country. As railroads became the primary means by which livestock and processed meat was shipped, St. Louis developed into a major livestock and meatpacking center. This was also due to the fact that most of the U.S. population lived east of the Mississippi River prior to 1900, while most of the animals used to produce the meat it consumed were raised west of it, thus making St. Louis a logical place for the interchange between supply and demand in the meat market. However, the Mississippi River provided a hindrance to this movement of livestock and meat to the East at first, because until 1874, when the Eads Bridge was completed, no bridge linking Missouri to Illinois had been constructed. This meant that livestock from the West had to be unloaded in St. Louis, then ferried across the river to East St. Louis",

This inefficiency provided additional costs to producers, both in time lost and money spent on ferry fees. It was these problems that caused a group of eastern financiers to invest in the construction of a large stockyard complex outside the already well-established rail center of East St. Louis.\nThe St. Louis National Stockyards Company is formed, 1873\nNational City had its beginnings as a business investment by East-Coast venture capitalists in the early 1870s.

St. Louis that would rival the famous Union Stock Yards in Chicago and make the stockyards in nearby St. Louis minor by comparison, and he approached a group of wealthy investors about establishing it. Most of these investors were railroad men, and virtually all of them were from the East. The man who led this group of investors was Archibald M. Allerton of the New York law firm Allerton, Dutcher and Moore, who also was one of the owners of New York s National Drove Yard. Allerton and his fellow investors believed such an operation would be a successful venture",

Allerton and his fellow investors believed such an operation would be a successful venture, but had several conditions they wanted met before they would invest in East St. Louis: 1) they wanted to build their operation on land not incorporated into any existing city, so as to avoid strict regulations, with a promise that East St. Louis would never attempt annexation of their property, 2) they wanted to build their own infrastructure independently of East St. Louis, and 3) they wanted East St. Louis to provide their property with city services such as fire protection. Mayor Bowman acquiesced to these conditions, and the agreement was made official on July 17, 1872, at the East St. Louis city council meeting. The investors had purchased 656 acres (2.65 km2) of land known as Gallagher Pastures (400 acres of which was procured from Mayor Bowman and W.D.

On October 31, 1872, the original 17 stockholders who had invested in the new stockyard operation met in Mayor Bowman s office and elected the first Board of Directors for the operation, with Archibald Allerton as its first President.

The National Stockyards had been built to accommodate up to 15,000 head of cattle, 10,000 sheep, 20,000 hogs, in addition to a large quantity of non-meat animals such as horses and mules. This large capacity did not go unnoticed by the meatpacking firms in the East, who very shortly after the Stockyards  inception began to build plants there which the Stockyards  board had anticipated by purchasing enough land to accommodate packinghouse operations alongside the yards. The centralization of stockyard operations along railroad terminals had led the major meatpacking companies to follow suit, locating their major operations near the stockyard operations to trim shipping costs connected to transporting whole animals by killing and processing their meat in a single location and shipping only the finished product. The first packinghouse operation to build a plant at the National Stockyards was the White House Provision Company. It was followed soon after by Richardson and Company s East St. Louis Packing and Provision Company, which opened on November 13, 1873. Richardson s was able to process 2,000 hogs per day at its beginning, and by the end of 1874 was processing 6,000 per day. Other packing companies began to arrive right on their heels.

The St. Louis Beef Canning Company relocated to the Stockyards in 1879, and was followed closely by plants owned by the big-name meatpacking firms. Nelson Morris began operations at the Stockyards in 1889, Gustavus Swift arrived in 1893, and Philip Armour commenced production in 1903. There were also many other smaller firms who built plants near the yards, who along with the big operations helped to make the St. Louis area and specifically the St. Louis National Stockyards one of the nation s premier meatpacking centers, with the Stockyards directly employing 1,200 workers and processing approximately 50,000 animals weekly and boasting sales of more than  2 million each year at the turn of the 20th century.\nRelated industries and infrastructure\nThe centralization of the stockyard and packinghouse operations at the St. Louis National Stockyards also led to the creation and expansion of other related industries at the site. The National Stock Yards National Bank, established with the yards in 1873, became a major financial institution in the St. Louis area, helping to finance the day-to-day operations of the yards.

Another major development came as the meatpacking firms began to realize that they could use the vast amount of animal by-products produced by their factories to create new industries some of which became established at the Stockyards. Other industries related to livestock also became established there, such as seed and feed businesses, companies that dealt in hardware and farm machinery, lumber, and fertilizer, and tanning and rendering plants.\nOther services and infrastructure soon followed. The St. Louis Live Stock Exchange was established in 1885 to manage livestock trading at the site, and it did not take long until the Stockyards had a United States Post Office, telegraph offices and the offices of The Daily National Live Stock Reporter, a trade newspaper. The Stockyards had paved roads, which East St. Louis did not have at the time, and its own waterworks that provided cleaner drinking water for the animals there than was available for the people living in downtown St. Louis at the time. It also boasted a system of fire hydrants to protect the operation from catastrophe.

However, things quickly became more complicated for the yards. The federal government began to push for food regulations and standards, spurred on by Upton Sinclair s novel The Jungle, which chronicled the meatpacking industry; the administration of President Theodore Roosevelt had begun to oppose what it called the  beef trust ; and the city of East St. Louis had tried to annex the yards, in violation of the agreement it had made with the company prior to the construction of the complex. In order to counter the increasing intervention of government into its affairs, the St. Louis National Stockyards and its related commercial interests incorporated as National City, Illinois, in July 1907. National City was in all respects a company town, as the St. Louis National Stockyards Company owned all the property in the town. The town consisted of two streets a block long, with about 40 houses arranged in four rows on them, a building that served as a church and school, a police fire station and a store.

Everything in the town was under the direct control of the company, from the mayor (handpicked by the company, the town only saw three changes of mayor between 1907 and 1982) to the tax assessments. This control enabled the St. Louis National Stockyards Company to efficiently run its own affairs with minimal outside governmental interference such as taxation and regulation. National City was the first industrial suburb outside East St. Louis, and it would set an example to be followed by other major industries in the St. Louis area, establishing such other company towns on the Illinois side of the Mississippi as Granite City (steel), Alorton (aluminum), Sauget (chemicals) and Wood River and Roxana (oil refinery).\nFrom incorporation through World War II (1907-1947)\nContinued growth\nFollowing its incorporation as National City, the St. Louis National Stockyards continued to grow as a livestock and meat processing center.

In addition, it placed third among American cattle markets and second among hog markets. In 1919, the total money received by the Stockyards was  8,257,798, illustrating the success of the yards during this time. However, World War I and its immediate aftermath would also cause the beginnings of dramatic changes for the Stockyards and its related operations changes that would ultimately be the beginning of the end for National City.\nRegulation\nDuring the first world war, inflation began to play a major toll on the Stockyards. Yardage fees were 20  higher than they had been before the war, and price levels were 60  higher at the end of the war than they had been in 1914. Exchange members increased their fees charged to livestock producers as well and the producers, feeling they were being cut out of wartime profits by these practices and conditions, appealed to the federal government to regulate the industry.\nThe federal government responded by passing the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921.

This law gave to the U.S. Department of Agriculture regulatory rights over ownership, trading practices and financial transactions in the stockyard industry. Perhaps most importantly, though, it separated the stockyard and meatpacking industries by forcing the major meatpacking firms to give up their majority interests in stockyard companies. The major business interests in these industries would fight back fiercely against this law s regulations, to no avail, over the next 20 years. This mandated divorce between the stockyard and meatpacking industries would be the first step toward the decentralization of both industries later in the 20th century a major factor in the decline of National City. However, another major factor evolving in the market during this period would have an even greater impact on National City and hasten its demise: the truck.\nFrom railroad to truck: transportation evolves\nThe first truckload of hogs rolled into National City in 1921. It would not be the last. Over the next two decades, trucks would gain a greater and greater percentage of the volume of animals delivered to the Stockyards, gradually supplanting the formerly powerful and important railroads as the most important mode of shipment for the yards.

By 1938, 60  of the livestock shipped to National City came by truck, and by 1952, that number would grow to 99  of hogs and 84  of all other animals. Following World War II, the Stockyards would respond to the evolution of the nation s transportation network and the increasing mechanization of industry. The yards were converted to handle truck traffic, and the last auctions of work horses and mules took place in 1948, as those animals became obsolete with the increasing ubiquity of farm machinery. This shift from railroad-based shipping to truck-based shipping would threaten the terminal livestock markets across the nation as the livestock and meatpacking industries evolved right alongside the transportation network.\nLabor issues\nAnother major change that affected National City during the first half of the 20th century was the unionization of packinghouse workers. Originally, the packinghouses and the Stockyards themselves had targeted immigrants who would work cheap to man their operations. The  de-skilling  of labor on the assembly lines of the packinghouses meant that workers could be hired with no experience and without even being able to speak English to work for a fraction of what it might cost to pay domestic workers.

Many thousands arrived in National City and the surrounding area, establishing themselves and making their living in the meatpacking plants. The poor working conditions and low pay of the packinghouses and the rise of unionism during this period, however, ultimately led the packinghouse workers to organize and resist their employers, seeking better wages and working conditions.\nOf course, the major meatpacking firms opposed this trend. Apprehensive of a unified, well-organized labor force, meatpackers like many other industrialists of this period hired people from many diverse, non-English-speaking ethnic groups in order to hinder the organization of their employees into unions. Another tactic used by the meatpackers was to bring in African-Americans from the South as replacement workers to create tension and discourage unionization and strikes. This latter move played a major role in causing the infamous East St. Louis Race Riots of 1917. However, the packers were not ultimately able to quell the fires of unionization, and by the 1950s virtually all the industries in National City packinghouses, railroads, etc. had become union workplaces.

The Stockyards continued to do well through the 1950s. Receipts of cattle vacillated during this decade, but National City competed for first in the nation in hog receipts, eventually surpassing Chicago and Omaha to become the largest hog market in the world in 1954 and earning East St. Louis the epithet  Hog Capital of the Nation . However, though National City would continue to dominate the hog market for the next decade, its fortunes were changing with the market. The advent of the truck and later, the interstate highway system coupled with rising labor costs connected to unionization and the antiquation of outdated factories was causing the meatpacking industry to decentralize and relocate away from centralized terminal markets such as National City to rural areas, where it could find cheaper, nonunion labor, build new factories close to the livestock producers and buy directly from them, thus eliminating the middleman of the stockyard",

However, as the 1960s began, its gradual decline had begun in earnest. The Armour packinghouse in National City was the first plant owned by a major national firm to close in 1959, laying off 1,400 employees. It would not be the last. By 1986, the last meatpacking plant located in National City had closed its doors, ending an era. As this process of decentralization was underway, the Stockyards themselves continued to gradually diminish in importance to the livestock industry as well. By 1963, National City had slipped to fifth in stockyard production, losing its place atop the hog market in 1967 to Omaha, and it dropped to third place just a year later as St. Paul overtook it. This was evidence not just of National City s decline, but also that of terminal livestock markets as a whole across the country.

This precipitous decline mirrored the loss of packinghouse operations to the rural countryside. In 1965, the St. Louis Metro-East region, of which National City was a part, had 43 packing plants processing 100,000 animals weekly; by 1970, just five years later, there were 32. In National City, Hunter Packing Company closed its doors in 1980, laying off 1,100 workers; Royal Packing Company followed closely behind in January 1981. They were followed by others, until Swift Independent Packing Company, the last packinghouse located in National City, shut down for good in 1986.\nThe stockyards attempt to adjust\nThe St. Louis National Stockyards Company attempted to reverse its declining fortunes, to no avail. They introduced the first stocker and feeder cattle auctions in October 1960, and they undertook conversion projects aimed at making the yards more truck-friendly, but these efforts to revitalize the Stockyards were ultimately unsuccessful.

Livestock farming in the U.S. had undergone a paradigm shift from a large number of small farmers to a relatively small number of huge corporate farms, where animals could be grown to full-size independently of a centralized stockyard operation. The interstate highway system constructed in the 1950s enabled the major meatpacking firms to bypass the railroads and terminal stockyard operations and purchase their animals directly from the producers, and with the advent of refrigerated trucks, the packing firms could locate their plants near the source of the animals, being able to ship their products anywhere in the country. This also provided them a way to avoid costly labor in unionized major cities, as most countryside labor pools were unorganized. The National City Stockyards were but one victim of this evolution in the market. Across the nation, the major terminal livestock markets were becoming obsolete and shutting down. The Chicago Union Stock Yards, long the industry leader, closed down in 1971; that year, the St. Louis National Stockyards Company was one of only 11 remaining terminal markets in the nation.\nAs the decline continued, the St. Louis National Stockyards saw many changes.

This building was saved. The 60-by-120-foot Village Hall was over 70 years old and originally used as a mule barn.

The Board of Saint Clair County then requested that the United States Census Bureau conduct a special census of National City, for the purpose of determining whether the town had a sufficient number of residents to avoid dissolution. The Census Bureau conducted the census, and found that the town had no residents. The Board then filed a petition in the county's Circuit Court, requesting an order that the town be dissolved. The Board relied on an Illinois statute that permitted the dissolution of an incorporated community that had fewer than 50 residents according to the most recent federal census. The Circuit Court granted the petition in 1997, and ordered the town dissolved. National City, as well as private citizens who had intervened in the case, appealed the order, but the Illinois Appellate Court affirmed it on October 3, 1997. National City's incorporated existence thus came to end.\nThough greatly diminished in importance, the Stockyards would continue to hold hog and cattle auctions until 1997.

Established as a centralized terminal livestock market, it owed its existence to the railroads, which transformed the livestock and meatpacking industries from spread-out, localized operations to consolidated and integrated major complexes in central urban locations. When the market evolved again in the mid-20th century with the interstate highway system and trucking coming to prominence, the railroads once king of shipping began to diminish, and with them the terminal markets as meatpackers were able to bypass the middlemen of the railroad and stockyard companies, leading to the meatpacking and livestock industries once again becoming decentralized. This ultimately led to National City s demise.\nPresent\nIn the years after its dissolution, National City was essentially a ghost town. There were no residents living there, and much of the land was a post-industrial wasteland, with the remains of dilapidated factories many overgrown with vegetation and covered in graffiti standing as empty, crumbling shells, testifying to the one-time greatness of the St. Louis National Stockyards as a national meatpacking and livestock center.\nNevertheless, National City was not completely abandoned.

Several industries moved there, including Darling, International, a major rendering company, a recycling plant and Baily International, one of America's largest manufacturers of Asian foods as well as several warehouse, heavy machinery and trucking operations. In addition, as of April 2010, there were several construction projects begun on the property as part of what was called the National City Redevelopment Area. World Wide Technology Raceway is located on the former community.\nA further injection of life into the area came with the planning and construction of the Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge, which carries Interstate 70 over the Mississippi River and which opened to traffic in February 2014. The new bridge has its first Illinois exit near the site of National City. This made the site attractive to industry and highly marketable. In the summer of 2012, a new river grain terminal was opened in the area because of its proximity to the future exit. In 2013, local leaders hoped that the bridge would spark further economic development in the area.\nTraffic Tickets\nIn 1990, National City received attention because of the large number of traffic tickets that its police department issued for moving violations on the one-mile stretch of Illinois Route 3 that bisected the small town.

Although the town had only 70 residents at the time, it had a police department with five full-time officers and seven part-time officers. In 1989, the officers issued 5,091 citations for alleged moving violations on Route 3. Most of the citations were for speeding, though some drivers were cited for multiple violations. Payments of the fines for the citations in 1989 brought more than  122,000 of revenue into the town's treasury, amounting to approximately one quarter of the town government's annual budget.\nThe town's police chief said at the time that drivers were ticketed for speeding only if they exceeded the posted speed limit by at least 10 miles per hour. The town's assistant police chief said that the enforcement program had been started five or six years earlier after residents complained about the number of accidents on Route 3. The assistant police chief also said that the 35 mile per hour speed limit on Route 3 in the town was clearly marked by multiple signs, and that the purpose of the enforcement program was to deter speeding and to prevent people from getting killed.\n   References",

Specimens are ovate in shape, and is a monotypic genus, containing only Lydonia jiggamintia.\nDiscovery\nThe holotype material for Lydonia was found on the Johnson Discovery Surface, from the Trepassey Formation, of the Catalina Dome on the Bonavista Peninsula, Newfoundland, Canada in 2008 and originally referred to the ichnotaxon Blackbrookia, but was re-described and formally named in 2025.\nEtymology\nThe generic name Lydonia is in honour of the punk rock musician John Lydon (Formally known as Johnny Rotten), due to the possible spiky, hair-like appearance it may have had in life. The specific name jiggamintia derives from the Latinised Beothuk word  jiggamint , to mean  gooseberry , a type of spiky currant.\nDescription\nLydonia jiggamintia is an ovate to obovate organism, growing up to 53 cm (20.9 in) in length, which is covered in small 5 mm (0.2 in) wide pores, which gives off a mesh-like appearance.

The body itself, which is rounded and one end and pointed at the other, has a notable rim around its margin, and is symmetrical along its longest axis, with a longitudinal fold going down this long axis. The pores themselves may have been open in life with raised rims. The pores are not evenly distributed over the body in any decipherable pattern, but are all vaguely spaced around 5 mm (0.2 in) from each other.\nLydonia may have also been inflated, as evidenced by its wrinkled fossil material, showing it may have a collapsed during burial, with a single specimen also featuring a noted bulging in the middle, perhaps hinting at a thicker middle, which thinned out towards the margins.\nPaleoecology\nLydonia was most likely either a sessile benthic or semi-infaunal organism in life, being covered by microbial matground, and may have colonised other macro-organisms in the general area. It has been noted that Lydonia is currently only known from surfaces that feature an abundance of Fractofusus, but this does not show any taxonomic relations. Its general mode of life and morphology as been noted to be similar to the extant demosponge Polymastia.\nThe morphology of Lydonia, one end being bulbous whilst the other is pointed, may be due to it adapting to the directional palaeocurrents, by having more surface area whilst not increasing the chance of the organism being dragged along or lifted by said palaeocurrent, and aiding in filter feeding. It may have also grown or encrusted over other organisms, altering how it may have looked from above.\nSee also\nList of Ediacaran genera\n   References",

He held the British featherweight title in 2003 and challenged once for the Commonwealth featherweight title in 2006.\nCareer\nBorn in Birkenhead, McKeever made his professional debut in March 1998 with a points win over Dave Hinds. After winning 13 of his first 17 fights he beat Tony Mulholland in September 2002 to take the vacant BBBofC Central Area and World Boxing Foundation Intercontinental featherweight titles.\nMcKeever and Mulholland met again in February 2003 for the vacant British featherweight title; McKeever stopped Mulholland in the sixth round to become British champion. In May he defended the title against Roy Rutherford, losing on points. He didn't fight again until he challenged for the title again in February 2004, this time against Dazzo Williams in Bridgend. The fight again went the distance, with Williams retaining the title.\nAfter 18 months out of the ring, McKeever returned in September 2005, winning his next three fights before challenging Jackson Asiku for the Commonwealth featherweight title in June 2006, Asiku stopping him in the first round.\nIn February 2007 he lost on points to Ryan Barrett for the British Master featherweight title, and the following month was stopped by Stevie Bell for the vacant BBBofC Central Area super featherweight title. In October he announced his retirement from boxing, but he returned in June 2008, Ryan Brawley stopping him in the seventh round.\nIn May 2010 he returned for the final time, losing on points to Dougie Curran.\nReferences\nExternal links\nBoxing record for Jamie McKeever from BoxRec (registration required)",

The film gained notoriety in America for having scenes of nudity cut in various states.\nMarkey directed and produced the film, also writing the screenplay and the  native melodies . His girlfriend Zoe Varney was credited as associate producer. Alfred Hill, the original composer, and Ted Coubray, the original cameraman, were both fired and not credited; Coubray also lost his camera to Markey. The film used unpaid Māori extras, and taonga, their cherished tribal artefacts, were lent by the cast; Markey took the artefacts when he returned to America, leaving unpaid bills behind him. Local investors had invested  10,000 in the film.\nThe film was shot in Waihi. It was released in America with sound added; a symphonic score by Oscar Potoker was added using the RCA Photophone System and  voice-over  narration, which avoided the problems of synchronisation.\nHei Tiki is one of four films (with The Devil's Pit, Down on the Farm, and On the Friendly Road) which claim to be the first  New Zealand talkie , although the claim is dubious in this case as the sound was added in America.\nPlot\nM",

The Environmental Justice Atlas documented 3,100 environmental conflicts worldwide as of April 2020 and emphasised that many more conflicts remained undocumented. \nParties involved in these conflicts include locally affected communities, states, companies and investors, and social or environmental movements; typically environmental defenders are protecting their homelands from resource extraction or hazardous waste disposal. Resource extraction and hazardous waste activities often create resource scarcities (such as by overfishing or deforestation), pollute the environment, and degrade the living space for humans and nature, resulting in conflict. A particular case of environmental conflicts are forestry conflicts, or forest conflicts which  are broadly viewed as struggles of varying intensity between interest groups, over values and issues related to forest policy and the use of forest resources . In the last decades, a growing number of these have been identified globally.\nFrequently environmental conflicts focus on environmental justice issues, the rights of indigenous people, the rights of peasants, or threats to communities whose livelihoods are dependent on the ocean. Outcomes of local conflicts are increasingly influenced by trans-national environmental justice networks that comprise the global environmental justice movement.\nEnvironmental conflict can complicate response to natural disaster or exacerbate existing conflicts   especially in the context of geopolitical disputes or where communities have been displaced to create environmental migrants.

The study of these conflicts is related to the fields of ecological economics, political ecology, and environmental justice.\nCauses\nThe origin of environmental conflicts can be directly linked to the industrial economy. As less than 10  of materials and energy are recycled, the industrial economy is constantly expanding energy and material extraction at commodity frontiers through two main processes:\nAppropriating new natural resources through territorial claims and land grabs.\nMaking exploitation of existing sites more efficient through investments or social and technical innovation\nEDCs are caused by the unfair distribution of environmental costs and benefits. These conflicts arise from social inequality, contested claims over territory, the proliferation of extractive industries, and the impacts of the economic industrialization over the past centuries. Oil, mining, and agriculture industries are focal points of environmental conflicts.\nTypes of conflicts\nA 2020 paper mapped the arguments and concerns of environmental defenders in over 2743 conflicts found in the Environmental Justice Atlas (EJAtlas). The analysis found that the industrial sectors most frequently challenged by environmental conflicts were mining (21 ), fossil energy (17 ), biomass and land uses (15 ), and water management (14 ).

There were more conflicts around conservation, water management, and biomass and land use in low income countries; while in high income countries almost half of conflicts focused on waste management, tourism, nuclear power, industrial zones, and other infrastructure projects. The study also found that most conflicts start with self-organized local groups defending against infringement, with a focus on non-violent tactics.\nWater protectors and land defenders who defend indigenous rights are criminalized at a much higher rate than in other conflicts.\nEnvironmental conflicts can be classified based on the different stages of the commodity chain: during the extraction of energy sources or materials, in the transportation and production of goods, or at the final disposal of waste.\nEJAtlas Categories\nThe EJAtlas was founded and is co-directed by Leah Temper and Joan Martinez-Alier, and it is coordinated by Daniela Del Bene.

EDCs arise from the unfair access to natural resources, unequally distributed burdens of environmental pollution, and relate to the exercise of power by different social actors when they enter into disputes over access to or impacts on natural resources. For example, a factory may pollute a river thus affecting the community whose livelihood depends on the water of the river.

Often conflicts take place between the global South and the global North, e.g. a Finnish forest company operating in Indonesia, or in econonomic peripheries, although there is a growing emergence of conflicts in Europe, including violent ones. There are also local conflicts that occur within a short commodity chain (e.g. local extraction of sand and gravel for a nearby cement factory).\nIntellectual history\nSince its conception, the term Ecological Distribution Conflict has been linked to research from the fields of political ecology, ecological economics, and ecofeminism. It has also been adopted into a non-academic setting through the environmental justice movement, where it branches academia and activism to assist social movements in legal struggles.\nIn his 1874 lecture  Wage Labour and Capital , Karl Marx introduced the idea that economic relations under capitalism are inherently exploitative, meaning economic inequality is an inevitability of the system. He theorised that this is because capitalism expands through capital accumulation, an ever-increasing process which requires the economic subjugation of parts of the population in order to function.\nBuilding on this theory, academics in the field of political economy created the term  economic distribution conflicts  to describe the conflicts that occur from this inherent economic inequality.

This type of conflict typically occurs between parties with an economic relationship but unequal power dynamic, such as buyers and sellers, or debtors and creditors.\nHowever, Martinez Allier and Martin O Connor noticed that this term focuses solely on the economy, omitting the conflicts that do not occur from economic inequality but from the unequal distribution of environmental resources. In response, in 1995, they coined the term  ecological distribution conflict . This type of conflict occurs at commodity frontiers, which are constantly being moved and reframed due to society's unsustainable social metabolism. These conflicts might occur between extractive industries and Indigenous populations, or between polluting actors and those living on marginalised land. Its roots can still be seen in Marxian theory, as it is based on the idea that capitalism's need for expansion drives inequality and conflict.\nUnfair ecological distribution can be attributed to capitalism as a system of cost-shifting. Neoclassical economics usually consider these impacts as  market failures  or  externalities  that can be valued in monetary terms and internalized into the price system. Ecological economics and political ecology scholars oppose the idea of economic commensuration that could form the basis of eco-compensation mechanisms for impacted communities.

Environmental justice scholars conclude that these conflicts are a force for sustainability. These scholars study the dynamics that drive these conflicts towards an environmental justice success or a failure.\nGlobally, around 17  of all environmental conflicts registered in the EJAtlas report environmental justices 'successes', such as stopping an unsustainable project or redistributing resources in a more egalitarian way.\nMovements usually shape their repertoires of contention as protest forms and direct actions, which are influenced by national and local backgrounds. In environmental justice struggles, the biophysical characteristics of the conflict can further shape the forms of mobilization and direct action. Resistance strategies can take advantage of  biophysical opportunity structures , where they attempt to identify, change or disrupt the damaging ecological processes they are confronting.\nFinally, the  collective action frames  of movements emerging in response to environmental conflicts becomes very powerful when they challenge the mainstream relationship of human societies with the environment.

These frames are often expressed through pithy protest slogans, that scholars refer to as the  vocabulary of environmental justice  and which includes concepts and phrases such as  environmental racism ,  tree plantations are not forests ,  keep the oil in the soil ,  keep the coal in the hole  and the like, resonating and empathizing with those communities affected by EDC.\nEnvironmentalism of the poor\nSome scholars make a distinction between environmentalist conflicts that have an objective of sustainability or resource conservation and environmental conflicts more broadly (which are any conflict over a natural resource). The former type of conflict gives rise to environmentalism of the poor, in which environmental defenders protect their land from degradation by industrial economic forces. Environmentalist conflicts tend to be intermodal conflicts in which peasant or agricultural land uses are in conflict with industrial uses (such as mining). Intramodal conflicts, in which peasants dispute amongst themselves about land use may not be environmentalist.\nIn this division movement such as La Via Campesina (LVC), or the International Planning Committee for Food Sovereignty (IPC) can be considered in the halfway between these two approaches. In their defense of peasant agriculture and against large-scale capitalist industrial agriculture, both LVC and the IPC have fundamentally contributed to promoting agroecology as a sustainable agriculture model across the globe, adopting an intermodal approach against",

A similar attitude has shaped the action of the Brazilian Landless Farmworkers movement (MST) in the way it has struggled with the idea of productivity and the use of chemical products by several agribusiness realities that destroy resources rich in fertility and biodiversity.\nSuch movements often question the dominant form of valuation of resource uses (i.e. monetary values and cost-benefit analyses) and renegotiate the values deemed relevant for sustainability. Sometimes, particularly when the resistance weakens, demands for monetary compensation are made (in a framework of  weak sustainability ). The same groups, at other times or when feeling stronger, might argue in terms of values which are not commensurate with money, such as indigenous territorial rights, irreversible ecological values, human right to health or the sacredness of redefining the very economic, ecological and social principles behind particular uses of the Mother Earth, implicitly defending a conception of  strong sustainability . In contesting and environment, such intermodal conflicts are those that are most clearly forced towards broader sustainability transitions.\nConflict resolution\nA distinct field of conflict resolution called Environmental Conflict Resolution, focuses on developing collaborative methods for deescalating and resolving environmental conflicts. As a field of practice, people working on conflict resolution focus on the collaboration, and consensus building among stakeholders. An analysis of such resolution processes found that the best predictor of successful resolution was sufficient consultation with all parties involved.\nA new tool with certain potential in this regard is the development of video games proposing distinct options to the gamers for handling conflicts over environmental resources, for instance in the fishery sector.\nCritique\nSome scholars critique the focus on natural resources used in descriptions of environmental conflict. Often these approaches focus on the commercialization of the natural environment that doesn't acknowledge the underlying value of a healthy environment.\nSee also\nUS Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution\nInventory of Conflict and Environment\n   References",

It is one of the two weather radio systems across North America along with the NOAA Weather Radio, and is an official partner of the National Weather Service. Weatheradio Canada is headquartered in Montreal, Quebec and transmits in both official languages (English and French) from 230 sites across Canada. Weatheradio Canada, as well as Environment Canada's weather telephone service Hello Weather, utilizes Nuance Communications text to speech voices. Starcaster Text-To-Speech, owned by STR-SpeechTech Ltd, was used from 1994 to 2021.\nHistory\nIn 1976, Environment Canada's Weatheradio service was launched and expanded to 30 locations in roughly 10 years. In the early-1990s, increased government investment permitted major expansion of the network to the present size of 230 sites.\nIn most locations, the service broadcasts on one of seven specially-allocated VHF radio frequencies, audible only on dedicated  weather band  receivers or any VHF radio capable of receiving 10 kHz bandwidth FM signals centred on these assigned channels, which are located within the larger  public service band .

As of August 2007, most of these AM and FM transmitters were unlicensed by the CRTC under a special license exemption granted to low-power non-commercial broadcasters.\nIn September 2020, Environment and Climate Change Canada began soliciting feedback on possible decommissioning of 48 of its 230 transmitters.

Weather alert broadcasts are inserted within the normal playlist, and are available in both official languages. Wind and wave marine forecasts are broadcast on a regular basis on transmitters located near marine zones. However, these and other forms of marine forecasts are more conveniently broadcast on the marine frequency, which is not available on most weather radios.

The air quality health index forecast is broadcast at the end of the broadcast cycle for cities in the station's service area.\nAlerting\nWhenever a weather or civil emergency alert is issued for any part of a Weatheradio Canada station's coverage area, many radios with an alert feature will sound an alarm or turn on upon detection of a 1,050 Hz attention tone that sounds just before the voice portion of an alert message. The specification calls for the Weatheradio Canada transmitter to sound the alert tone for ten seconds and for the receiver to react to it within five seconds. This system simply triggers the alarm or turns on the radio of every muted receiver within reception range of that station (in other words, any receiver located anywhere within the transmitter's broadcast area). Generally, receivers with this functionality are either older or basic models.\nMany newer or more sophisticated alerting receivers can detect, decode and react to a digital signal called Specific Area Message Encoding (SAME), which allows users to program their radios to receive alerts only for specific geographical areas of interest and concern, rather than for an entire broadcast area. These advanced models may also have colored LED status lights which indicate the level of the alert as an  advisory   statement ,  watch ",

The action was orchestrated by Phelps Dodge, the major mining company in the area, which provided lists of workers and others who were to be arrested to the Cochise County sheriff, Harry C. Wheeler. Those arrested were taken to a local baseball park before being loaded onto cattle cars and deported 200 miles (320 km) to Tres Hermanas in New Mexico. \nThe 16-hour journey was through desert without food and with little water. Once unloaded, the deportees, most without money or transportation, were warned against returning to Bisbee. The U.S. government soon brought in members of the U.S. Army to assist with relocating the deportees to Columbus, New Mexico.\nAs Phelps Dodge, in collusion with the sheriff, had closed down access to outside communications, it was some time before the story was reported.

Each wore a white armband for identification, and carried a list of the men on strike. At 6:30 a.m., the deputies moved through town and arrested every man on their list, as well as any man who refused to work in the mines. Several men who owned local grocery stores were also arrested. In the process, the deputies took cash from the registers and all the goods they could carry. They arrested many male citizens of the town, seemingly at random, and anyone who had voiced support for the strike or the IWW. Two men died: Deputy Sheriff Orson McRae was shot and killed by a miner he had tried to arrest, and the other was the miner (shot dead by three other deputies moments later).\nAt 7:30 a.m., the 2,000 arrested men were assembled in front of the Bisbee Post Office and marched two miles (3",

Sheriff Wheeler oversaw the march from a car outfitted with a loaded Marlin 7.62 mm belt-fed machine gun. At the baseball field, the arrestees were told that if they denounced the IWW and went back to work, they would be freed. Only men who were not IWW members or organizers were given this choice. About 700 men agreed to these terms, while the rest sang, jeered or shouted profanities.\nAt 11:00 a.m., the El Paso and Southwestern Railroad brought 23 cattle cars to Bisbee. The posse deputies forced the remaining 1,286 arrestees at gunpoint to board the cars, many of which had more than three inches (76 mm) of manure on the floor. Although temperatures were in the mid-90s Fahrenheit, (mid-30s Celsius), no water had been provided to the men since the arrests began at dawn.\nThe train stopped 10 miles (16 km) east of Douglas to take on water, some of which was provided to the deportees in the packed cars.

The train continued to Columbus, New Mexico (about 175 miles (282 km) away), arriving at about 9:30 p.m. Initially prevented from unloading at Columbus, the train slowly traveled west another 20 miles (32 km) to Hermanas, not stopping until 3:00 a.m.\nDuring the Bisbee Deportation, Phelps Dodge executives seized control of the telegraph and telephones to prevent news of the arrests and expulsion from being reported. Company executives refused to let Western Union send wires out of town, and stopped Associated Press reporters from filing stories. News of the Bisbee Deportation was made known only after an IWW attorney, who met the train in Hermanas, issued a press release.\nWith 1,300 penniless men in Hermanas, the Luna County sheriff worriedly wired the Governor of New Mexico for instructions. Republican Governor Washington Ellsworth Lindsey said the men should be treated humanely and fed; he urgently contacted President Wilson and asked for assistance.

The deportees were housed in tents originally intended for use by Mexican refugees, who had fled across the border to the United States to escape the Mexican Army's Pancho Villa Expedition. The men were allowed to stay in the camp for two months until September 17, 1917.\nAftermath\nFrom the day of the deportations until November 1917, the Citizens' Protective League ruled Bisbee. Based in a building owned by the copper companies, its representatives interrogated residents about their political beliefs with respect to unions and the war, determining who could work or obtain a draft deferment. Sheriff Wheeler established guards at all entrances to Bisbee and Douglas. Anyone seeking to exit or enter the town over the next several months had to have a  passport  issued by Wheeler. Any adult male in town who was not known to the sheriff's men was brought before a secret sheriff's kangaroo court. Hundreds of citizens were tried, and most of them were deported and threatened with lynching if they returned. Even long-time citizens of Bisbee were deported by this  court .\nWhen ordered to cease these activities by the Arizona Attorney General, Wheeler tried to explain his actions.

Perhaps everything that I did wasn't legal....It became a question of 'Are you American, or are you not?'  He told the Attorney General:  I would repeat the operation any time I find my own people endangered by a mob composed of eighty percent aliens and enemies of my Government. \nThese actions took place during a period in the early 20th century when attacks by anarchists and labor unrest and violence erupted in numerous American cities and industries. Many native-born Americans were worried about such actions, attributing the unrest to the high numbers of immigrants, rather than to the poor working conditions in many industries. As a result, national press reaction to the Bisbee Deportation was muted. Although many newspapers carried stories about the event, most of them editorialized that the workers  must have  been violent, and therefore  gotten what they deserved , thus criminalizing the victims. Some major papers said that Sheriff Wheeler had gone too far, but declared that he should have imprisoned the miners rather than deported them. \nThe New York Times criticized the violence on the part of the mine owners and suggested that mass arrests  on vagrancy charges  would have been appropriate. Former President Theodore Roosevelt said that  no human being in his senses doubts that the men deported from Bisbee were bent on destruction and murder. \nThe men deported from Bis",

Former President Theodore Roosevelt said that  no human being in his senses doubts that the men deported from Bisbee were bent on destruction and murder. \nThe men deported from Bisbee pleaded with President Wilson for protection and permission to return to their homes. In October 1917, Wilson appointed a commission of five individuals to investigate labor disputes in Arizona. They were led by Secretary of Labor William B. Wilson (with support from Assistant Secretary of Labor Felix Frankfurter, future Associate Justice of the US Supreme Court). The commission heard testimony during the first five days of November 1917. In its final report, issued on November 6, 1917, the commission denounced the Bisbee Deportation.  The deportation was wholly illegal and without authority in law, either State or Federal,  the commissioners wrote.\nProsecution\nOn May 15, 1918, the U.S. Department of Justice ordered the arrest of 21 Phelps Dodge executives, including some from the Calumet and Arizona Co., and several elected leaders and law enforcement officers from Bisbee and Cochise Counties. The arrestees included Walter S. Douglas.

The Justice Department appealed, but in United States v. Wheeler, 254 U.S. 281 (1920), Chief Justice Edward Douglass White wrote for an 8-to-1 majority that the U.S. Constitution did not empower the federal government to enforce the rights of the deportees. Rather, it  necessarily assumed the continued possession by the states of the reserved power to deal with free residence, ingress and egress.  Only in a case of  state discriminatory action  would the federal government have a role to play.\nArizona officials never initiated criminal proceedings in state court against those responsible for the deportation of workers and their lost wages and other losses. Some workers filed civil suits, but in the first case the jury determined that the deportations represented good public policy and refused to grant relief. Most of the other suits were quietly dropped, although a few workers received payments in the range of  500 to  1,250.\nThe Bisbee Deportations were later used by some proponents as an argument in favor of stronger laws against unpopular speech. Such laws would be justified as empowering the government to suppress disloyal speech and activity, and remove the need for citizens groups to take actions the government could not.

Such laws would be justified as empowering the government to suppress disloyal speech and activity, and remove the need for citizens groups to take actions the government could not. During World War I, the federal government used the Sedition Act of 1918 to prosecute people for statements in opposition to the war.\nAt the end of the conflict, Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer and others advocated for a peacetime equivalent of the Sedition Act, using the Bisbee events as a justification. They claimed that the only reason the company representatives and local law enforcement had taken the law into their own hands was that the government lacked the power to suppress radical sentiment directly. If the government were armed with appropriate legislation and the threat of long prison terms, private citizens would not feel the need to act. Writing in 1920, Harvard Professor Zechariah Chafee mocked that view:  Doubtless some governmental action was required to protect pacifists and extreme radicals from mob violence, but incarceration for a period of twenty years seems a very queer kind of protection. \nThere was a second round of trials in 1920, wherein 210 defendants were brought before the court in January 1920.

French, and continued though September. October, November and December were spent collecting depositions. The first defendant was Henry E. Wootten, whose trial began on March 11, 1920. During the jury selection process in February, French was taken ill, and attorney A. A. Worsley was named to succeed him as prosecutor. \nUpon French's recovery by the end of February, he again took the reins of the prosecution, with Worsley assisting. The trial lasted through March and April, and on April 30, after a 16 minute deliberation, Wootten was acquitted of the kidnapping charges. There followed several other trials, including the  blanket case , which included about 150 defendants.\nEffects\nThe later history of American deportations of alleged radicals and other undesirables from the country did not follow the precedent of Bisbee and Jerome, which were considered vigilante actions by private citizens. Instead, later deportations were authorized by law and executed by government agents.

    "text": ", there was a serious discussion within the Vanderbilt community about whether the school should de-emphasize intercollegiate athletics and refocus on its academic program. As a compromise between those who advocated increased athletics competition and those who argued in favor of de-emphasis, the gymnasium was built to hold only about 9,000 seats, and it would be readily adaptable to other uses significantly, as a possible concert hall.\nConsequently, the gymnasium floor was built up above its surroundings, more in the nature of a stage. The areas out of bounds along the sidelines were very wide, in contrast with the small facility which it replaced, where the walls were right along the sidelines and players could scrape their shoulders bringing the ball up the court. This necessitated the placement of the benches at the end of the court, which was not highly unusual at the time.\nIn addition, each goal was anchored by two far-reaching beams attached to support columns, with extra support coming from cables stretching all the way to the gym's ceiling. In the case of a backboard shatter or beam fracture, replacing these goals would be highly difficult, compared to the usual goal setup at most venues.\nMemorial Gym is well known for its unusual design. The end-of-the-floor bench location is now unique in major college basketball, and SEC coaches who travel to Memorial, along with coaches from other schools who have played at Vanderbilt as a post-season venue, have said that the unusual setup gives Vanderbilt a",

He was the executive secretary of the Party of Socialists of the Republic of Moldova (PSRM) and the de facto leader of the party from 2022 to 2023.\nCareer\nEducation\nBatrincea was registered at the Faculty of History and philosophy of Moldovan State University in 1999. After the first year of studies he was expelled due to overdue and absent hours. He followed his studies at Slavonic University in Moldova, where he took his master's degree in international law. Batrîncea is also a chess player.\nPolitical career\nHe was a Member of the Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova until 2011. In that year he was part of Igor Dodon's group that left the communists, setting up the Party of Socialists of the Republic of Moldova. In PSRM, Batrîncea has been on a rapid rise, becoming a Member of the Republican Committee of the PSRM, a Member of the party's political Executive Committee, and since June 2013   executive secretary of the party.\nIn the parliamentary elections of 30 November 2014 in the Republic of Moldova, he ran for the post of deputy from PSRM, being the 7th in the list",

On 9 June 2019, Vlad Batrîncea was elected President of the PSRM fraction in the Parliament.\nPolitical position\nAs a member of the PSRM, Batrîncea is known for his strong pro-Russian stance, supporting Moldova's accession to the Eurasian Economic Union (Moldova currently has observer status in this organisation). He is also known for his populist rhetoric. In April 2022, Batrîncea led a failed attempt by the PSRM to dismiss Octavian Armașu as governor of the National Bank of Moldova.\nRegarding the Russian invasion of Ukraine Batrîncea stated on 16 June 2023:  Russia is to blame for this war, and other politicians and important countries of the world are responsible for this war.

I am talking about those who fuel militaristic rhetoric in every possible way. \nControversies\nOn 10 December 2015, in the applause of his fellow party colleagues, Batrîncea destroyed the map of Greater Romania, a gesture in protest against an order of the Ministry of Education through which the map was to be distributed, by donation from an association, as teaching material, in the education system for use in history lessons. The next day, Liberal Deputy Alina Zotea addressed a request to Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, asking him to declare Batrîncea persona non grata and to ban him from entering Romania. Romanian Ambassador to Moldova Marius Lazurca did not consider Batrîncea's move an offense against his country.  A Moldovan politician wanted to demonstratively destroy an object with teaching use. Some of the deputies from Mr Batrîncea's party found it appropriate to applaud this gesture. Along with Mr Batrîncea was the Former Prime-Minister Zinaida Greceanîi, who did not applaude, which I find to be a proof of wisdom and moderation , said the ambassador. In 2018 Batrîncea stated that he did not regret his action, saying it was not an anti-Romanian gesture, but against a non-existing country. In 2021, the unionist deputy Vasile Șoimaru (PAS) gave Batrîncea another map of Greater Romania, saying  I found a destroyed map six years ago. If you allow me, I will return it to the one who may be sorry he did so then. Even if he is not sorry, I give him this map and ask him not to do it again if he wants to remain a colleague with us .\nAwards\nOrder of Work Glory (2018)\n   References",

This was the first election to the district council following the implementation of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973.\nThe election used the 24 wards created by the Formation Electoral Arrangements in 1974. Each ward elected one councillor using first-past-the-post voting.\nLabour took control of the council after winning a majority. The party took 13 of the 24 seats and more than 40  of the popular vote. Independent candidates won five seats and the Conservatives took four. The remaining two seats were won by Moderates\nBackground\nPrior to 1974, the area that was to become Cunninghame, was split between two counties   the County of Ayr and the County of Bute. Within that were six of the 17 burghs of the County of Ayr (Ardrossan, Irvine, Kilwinning, Largs, Saltcoats and Stevenston) and one of the two burghs of the County of Bute (Millport). These were all small burghs so the burgh council had limited powers which included some control over planning as well as local taxation, building control, housing, lighting and drainage with the rest of the local government responsibility falling to the county council.\nFollowing the recommendations in the Wheatly Report, the old system of counties and burghs",

The Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 implemented most of the recommendations in the Wheatly Report.

The Blue Series is shorter than the other two series - The Red Series and the  specials  - but is possibly the most popular. The Blue series is so called because the covers of the books were blue.\nHistory of the series\nIn the 1950s, the Franco-Belgian comics magazine Tintin had a good following in France and Wallonia (the French speaking part of Belgium). However, the sister publication Kuifje, aimed at the Dutch speaking part of Belgium, suffered in comparison. So they brought in a Dutch-speaking cartoonist - Willy Vandersteen. In Tintin, he created 6 stories from 1952 to 1957. Hergé taught Vandersteen to draw in the ligne claire style, so these 6 stories were Vandersteen's first works drawn in the ligne claire style. It was decided that when these stories were published as books they would have blue covers to distinguish them from the earlier books with red covers. When Vandersteen left the magazine, he continued his stories, but they were again released with red covers.\nBibliography\nHet Spaanse spook (The Spanish Spook)\nDe bronzen sleutel (The Bronze Key)\nDe Tartaarse helm (The Tartar Helmet)\nDe schat van Beersel (The Treasure of Beersel)\nHet geheim der gladiatoren (The Gladiators' Secret)\nDe gezanten van Mars (The Martian Ambassadors)\nDe groene splinter (The Green Splinter)\nSee also\nThe Red Series\nList of Spike and Suzy books in English\nList of Suske en Wiske albums\nSpike and Suzy\nWilly Vandersteen\nLigne claire\n   References",
