    "text": "The Duke of Edinburgh's International Award Canada is the Canadian branch of The Duke of Edinburgh's Award, a personal achievement program available to people in Canada between the ages of 14 and 25. As of 2020, over 500,000 had earned the award. Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh is patron of The Duke of Edinburgh's International Award. Concept\nThe Duke of Edinburgh's Award was created by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, then the consort of Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada, with the intent of encouraging young people to set and achieve their own goals and challenges. There are three levels bronze, silver, and gold but, no competition between participants, as it is a personal achievement program, and there are no set standards to measure achievements; the criteria are based on each participant's improvement and growth. Participants must set goals in multiple program areas: service, skills, physical recreation, an adventurous journey, and an additional project. History\nThe award was launched in Canada in 1963 and opened up to all young Canadians between the ages of 14 and 24. Pilot projects were launched in various cities in Nova Scotia, Ontario, and British Columbia. The following year, one of the first award ceremonies was held, with 48 bronze and six silver awards presented, and the first Gold Award ceremony took place in Ottawa in 1968, when The Duke of Edinburgh presented 18 recipients with their Gold Awards.",

In 2018, over 42,000 Canadians participated in the award. Nationally, the program has developed several initiatives to expand the award so it becomes more accessible to at-risk youth, inner-city youth, young offenders, youth with disabilities, as well as northern and aboriginal youth. The award in Canada is associated with the Duke of Edinburgh's International Foundation. In 1967, Canada hosted the first International Gold Event in 1967. Twenty-one years later, Canada became a founding member of the Duke of Edinburgh's Award International Association and is currently one of the four largest national award authorities. In 2002, Canada hosted its second international gold event, Rendezvous 2002. Following the death of Prince Philip in 2021, his youngest son, Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh, was made patron of The Duke of Edinburgh's International Award, announced on 14 March 2023, four days after his oldest brother, Charles III, King of Canada, created him Duke of Edinburgh.

    "text": "The Old Wives' Tale is a novel by Arnold Bennett, first published in January 1908. It deals with the lives of two very different sisters, Constance and Sophia Baines, following their stories from their youth, working in their mother's draper's shop, into old age. It covers a period of approximately 65 years roughly from 1840 to 1905, and is set in Bursley (modeled on Burslem) and Paris. It is generally regarded as one of Bennett's finest works. Bennett was initially inspired to write the book by a chance encounter in a Parisian restaurant. In the introduction to the book, he says\n...an old woman came into the restaurant to dine. She was fat, shapeless, ugly, and grotesque. She had a ridiculous voice, and ridiculous gestures. It was easy to see that she lived alone, and that in the long lapse of years she had developed the kind of peculiarity which induces guffaws among the thoughtless. and\nI reflected, concerning the grotesque diner:  This woman was once young, slim, perhaps beautiful; certainly free from these ridiculous mannerisms. Very probably she is unconscious of her singularities. Her case is a tragedy. One ought to be able to make a heartrending novel out of the history of a woman such as she. Every stout, ageing woman is not grotesque far from it!",

    "text": "Her case is a tragedy. One ought to be able to make a heartrending novel out of the history of a woman such as she. Every stout, ageing woman is not grotesque far from it! but there is an extreme pathos in the mere fact that every stout ageing woman was once a young girl with the unique charm of youth in her form and movements and in her mind. And the fact that the change from the young girl to the stout ageing woman is made up of an infinite number of infinitesimal changes, each unperceived by her, only intensifies the pathos. Bennett also found inspiration in Maupassant's novel Une Vie. Synopsis\nThe book is divided into four parts. The first section,  Mrs Baines , details the adolescence of both Sophia and Constance, and their life in their father's shop and house (a combined property) in Bursley, a lightly dramatised version of Burslem. The father is ill and bedridden, and the main adult in their life is Mrs Baines, their mother. By the end of the first book, the more adventurous and frivolous sister, Sophia (whose name reflects her sophistication, as opposed to the constant Constance), escapes Bursley to London and elopes with the travelling salesman, Gerald Scales, against her family s wishes.",

    "text": "Sophia and her husband alight to Paris and she leaves her family behind, ashamed that the money she used to find her freedom was stolen from her wealthy aunt. Constance meanwhile becomes engaged to Mr. Samuel Povey, who works in the shop. The second part,  Constance , details the life of Constance from that point forward up until the time she is reunited with her sister in old age. Her life, although outwardly prosaic, is nevertheless filled with personal incident, including the birth of her son, Cyril; the execution of her brother-in-law, Daniel Povey, who had accidentally killed his alcoholic wife; and the subsequent death of her husband, Samuel, whose health fell into rapid disrepair after his brother s conviction; and her concerns about the character and behaviour of her son, who nevertheless performs well enough at school to win a competitive and coveted scholarship, which takes him away from home. The third part,  Sophia , carries forward the story of what happened to Sophia after her elopement. Initially living off her husband, Gerald Scales,  12,000 inheritance, Gerald irresponsibly squanders the sum in a couple of years and runs off, insolvent. Abandoned by her husband in Paris, Sophia shrewdly survives the Siege of Paris and the Paris Commune using a small sum of money she stole from Gerald before his insolvency and eventually becomes the reputable owner of a successful pension.",

The final part,  What Life Is , details how the two sisters are eventually reunited and reflects upon how their lives and fates, despite the vast difference in their demeanor, end up in the same town that had connected them from birth, even as the very character of the town changes underneath them. Sophia returns to England and the house of her childhood, where Constance has never left. The last part follows both sisters until their deaths, with Constance s death coming after she mustered her last physical strength to vote against the federation of Bursley and the Five Towns into a combined city, with deleterious effects on Bursley s aged city center. The vote fails, a seeming victory for Constance, who passes away. After her death, a loophole is discovered that invalidates the vote, and Bursley is federated with its neighboring cities, a dramatised version of what is today Stoke-upon-Trent.

After a disappointing end to the 2014 season that saw the team knocked out of the 2014 NWSL Championship Playoffs by eventual league champions FC Kansas City, head coach Paul Riley sought to make changes that would bolster the team's roster to account for the players who would be called up to their respective national teams during the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup. After stellar performances in 2014, goalkeeper Nadine Angerer and midfielder Verónica Boquete were both named to the ten player shortlist of the 2014 FIFA World Player of the Year and Boquete was named to the NWSL Best XI as well as being named 2014 Supporters' Player of the Year. The team made a number of signings before the 2015 season including Genoveva Añonma who captains the Equatorial Guinea women's national football team, a 2015 NWSL College Draft day trade of the Thorns' 2014 season leading scorer Jessica McDonald for Jodie Taylor of the England women's national football team and leading scorer of the Washington Spirit, and defender Kat Williamson, former Thorns player who had been traded away during the 2014 season.",

The Italian text is an extensive revision of the libretto by Metastasio first set by Antonio Caldara in 1736, by Mattia Verazi, court poet and private secretary to the Elector Palatine Carl Theodor. The opera was the first of two which J. C. Bach set for the Elector Palatine. Some of the music was reused from earlier works, including part of the overture from Carattaco (composed in London in 1767). Performance history\nTemistocle was first performed at the Court Theatre in Mannheim on 4 November 1772, with a notable cast including Anton Raaff and Dorothea and Elisabeth Wendling, all singers that later worked with Mozart. Roles\nSynopsis\nThe opera takes place in Persia. Temistocle, together with his son Neocle, has been expelled from Athens. He arrives incognito at Susa, the capital of his arch-enemy King Serse, to find that his daughter Aspasia (in love with the Athenian ambassador Lisimaco) has also made her way there, following a shipwreck. Eventually all is revealed and Serse magnanimously pardons everybody, unites the lovers and makes peace with Athens.",

The chapel of Saint Mary was built after the plague of 1676. The chapel experienced major restructuring in 1961 when it was enlarged to accommodate the increasing population of the area. This was done on the initiative of Rev. Salv Farrugia.At the present day the church is being taken care of by the Kumitat Pastorali ta' Bubaqra. Nigret Chapel dedicated to the Immaculate conception of Mary\nThe present church was built on the site of a previous chapel dedicated to the Annunciation which was deconsecrated by Bishop Miguel Juan Balaguer Camarasa on 24 November 1658. The church was built by commander James Togores de Valemuola and was finally consecrated by the parish priest of the village Rev. Karm Delicata on 11 October 1739. Chapel of the Annunciation, Ħal-Millieri\nThe now uninhabited village of Ħal-Millieri was first documented in 1419 though it originates from Roman or even pre-historic times. The present church was built around 1450 on the site of an earlier 13th century chapel. The chapel was consecrated in 1480.",

During Monsignor Pietro Dusina's apostolic visit to Ħal-Millieri, in 1575, he found that there were a total of four churches in the area. Only two of these remain standing; the Annunciation and Saint John the Evangelist. During his visit, Dusina found that the church was in a state of good repair, had three altars and paved. However, he found that the church was not equipped with sacred vestments, income or even a rector. Chapel of Saint John the Evangelist in Ħal-Millieri\nThe original medieval chapel dedicated to Saint John was built sometime around 1481. It is recorded in inquisitor Pietro Dusina's report of his apostolic visit to the chapel in 1575. The report states that the chapel was in a dilapidated state, there were no doors, there were stone benches and a floor of beaten earth. Consequently, the church was deconsecrated. However, some time later it was reconsecrated and equipped with religious objects. Chapel of St. Leo\nThe chapel serves as the official cemetery chapel of Żurrieq. It is the only such chapel dedicated to Pope Leo I in Malta.",

In this chapel one could also find an old painting on wood that from 1343 to 1575 was in the chapel in Filfla. Today, this painting is found in the parish church of Żurrieq. Chapel of St. Agatha\nThe original church which stood on the site of the present church was built sometime in the 16th century. However it was deconsecrated by the Bishop of Malta, Balaguer on 24 November 1658. The present church was built by Cikku Grixti as a fulfillment of a vow made by a woman. It was blessed by the vicar general Philip Amato on 27 February 1859. The church served as a spiritual base for British soldiers during World War II. In 1952, the church was enlarged and decorated with important items such as the Via Crucis and new vestments. The painting depicting Saint Agatha was restored by R. Bonnici Cali.

    "text": "Santiam Academy was an early primary and secondary school in Lebanon, Oregon, United States, run by the Methodist Episcopal Church. History\nThe predecessor of the school was founded by pioneers in 1852 in a log cabin. Santiam Academy was created on January 18, 1854, by an act of the Oregon Territorial Legislature, and a larger building was constructed between 1854 and 1856. Among the members of the first board of trustees were Delazon Smith and David W. Ballard. Attendance at the school dropped after the establishment of a public school district in 1870, and the academy shut down during the 1903 1904 school year. The church then turned the property over to the Lebanon School District. The building was torn down in the 1930s; in 1945, Santiam School was built on the site, across from Lebanon High School. Santiam School closed in 1982 and was torn down in 2002. The site is now a Lebanon city park.

    "text": "Aycliffe Stadium was a sports facility located in County Durham, England, on the southern edge of the Aycliffe Industrial Estate, which has Newton Aycliffe to the North and Aycliffe Village to the South. The stadium was originally used for greyhound racing and then speedway before stock car racing. Stock Cars\nIt was a short (370 yard) oval tarmac race track, which was used for stock car racing from the mid-1950s until it was closed at the end of 1989. The most regular formula to appear at Aycliffe Stadium was the BriSCA Formula 1 Stock Cars, closely followed by the smaller BriSCA Formula 2 Stock Cars category. National Saloon Stock Car Racing and Banger racing were also regularly held at Aycliffe, along with the occasional Demolition Derby, and the occasional demonstration visit from Autograss formula and Hot Rods (oval racing). The site was used each year for the town's firework display on Guy Fawkes Night. For many Aycliffe is remembered as the Action Track. Aycliffe's tight corners and its suspended steel rope fence, combined with BriSCA's brand of contact racing regularly produced an action-packed spectacle. For most of its history, the stadium was associated with the British Stock Car Association (BriSCA).",

The first BriSCA licensed race took place on 10 July 1966, and the final BriSCA event was held on 19 November 1989. On Good Friday, 16 April 1954, the first stock car race in Great Britain took place in London at New Cross Stadium. The sport was an instant success and races took place all over the country. Until recently, it is widely believed that the first Stock Car meeting at Aycliffe took place on 7 October 1956. However, photographs from 1955 of a driver's presentation evening at the North Briton Pub (in Aycliffe Village) suggest that stock car racing had already taken place at Aycliffe in 1955. In 1957, Jimmy Wilkinson took over as the promoter at Aycliffe. He retained control of the stadium until 1964, when he handed the role of promoter over to three regular Aycliffe drivers - Tony Neal (100), Ron 'Dixie' Dean (20), and Tom Geldard (154). In 1966, the three brought Aycliffe Stadium into the BriSCA organisation. July 10 was the first licensed meeting. In 1975 Tony Neal emigrated to New Zealand, leaving Tom, Ron and Cissy Dean to run Aycliffe.",

The name of the village is derived from German personal name Bruno. History\nIt was first mentioned in a written document in 1566 as Braune. Politically the village belonged then to the Duchy of Teschen, a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg monarchy. In 1572, it was sold together with Bielsko and a dozen surrounding villages by dukes of Cieszyn and split from their duchy to form Bielsko state country (since 1754 Duchy of Bielsko). After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political and legal district of Bielsko.",

Several witnesses reported a car and a pickup truck fell into the river, however only the two occupants of the car were recovered, no other vehicles were found and no other persons were ever reported missing. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the probable cause of the temporary bridge collapse was the selection by the Hamilton County Engineer's Office of a design by the National Engineering and Contracting Company that did not consider lateral loads and the failure of the Hamilton County Engineer's Office to promptly close the bridge when it became subject to significant debris loading. Contributing to the cause of the collapse was the failure of the Hamilton County Engineer's Office to submit the bridge design plans to the Ohio Department of Transportation for review as required by state law. The one-lane bridge was intended to carry U.S. 52 traffic while a replacement for the 93-year-old Miamitown Bridge was being built. It was a compromise between the engineer's office and nearby residents and merchants. References",

The Bank of England, railways, heavy industry and coal mining were all nationalised. Unlike the others, the most controversial issue was nationalisation of steel, which was profitable.

American loans and Marshall Plan grants kept the economy afloat. India, Pakistan, Burma and Ceylon gained independence. Britain was a strong anti-Soviet factor in the Cold War and helped found NATO in 1949. Many historians describe this era as the  post-war consensus , emphasising how both the Labour and Conservative Parties until the 1970s tolerated or encouraged nationalisation, strong trade unions, heavy regulation, high taxes, and generous welfare state. The Labour Party introduced charges for NHS dental services and glasses in 1951. The Conservatives returned to power in 1951, accepting most of Labour's post-war reforms but introducing prescription charges to the NHS in 1952 and denationalising steel in 1953.

The party quickly nationalised critical sectors of the economy, especially declining industries. The Bank of England was nationalised along with railways (see Transport Act 1947), coal mining, public utilities and heavy industry. The most controversial case was the takeover of the highly profitable iron and steel industry, which was opposed and finally reversed by the Conservatives. Welfare state\nA comprehensive welfare state was created with the National Insurance Act 1946, in which people in work paid a flat rate of National Insurance. In return, they (and the wives of male contributors) were eligible for flat-rate pensions, sickness benefit, unemployment benefit, and funeral benefits. Various other pieces of legislation provided for child benefit and support for people with no other source of income. In the estimation of historians, and later politicians of the major parties, the most successful and permanent program was the creation of a National Health Service which started operations in 1947. It entitled all citizens to healthcare, which, funded by taxation, was free at the point of delivery. The opposition from physicians was bought off by allowing them to keep lucrative private practices on the side. All hospitals were nationalised and brought into the system.",

Michael Foot adds that Bevan had to persuade  the most conservative and respected profession in the country to accept and operate the Labour government's most intrinsically socialist proposition. In the end historians give Bevan the major credit for the success. One of the main achievements of Attlee's government was the maintenance of near full employment. The government maintained most of the wartime controls over the economy, including control over the allocation of materials and manpower, and unemployment rarely rose above 500,000, or 3  of the total workforce. In fact labour shortages proved to be more of a problem. One area where the government was not quite as successful was in housing, which was also the responsibility of Aneurin Bevan. The government aimed to build 400,000 new houses a year to replace those destroyed in the war, but shortages of materials and manpower meant that less than half this number were built.",

John Maynard Keynes argued the only solution was to drastically cut back the spending on the British Empire, which amounted to  2,000 million. The post-war overseas deficit was  1,400 million, warned Keynes. and,  it is this expenditure which is wholly responsible for either financial difficulties. Both Churchill and Attlee ignored his advice and kept spending heavily, in part by borrowing from India. The United States provided a large 50-year loan in 1946, and the sudden grant of independence to India and Pakistan in 1947 sharply cut expenses.

India\nFor decades the Conservatives were split on India between die-hard imperialists (led by Churchill) and moderate elements who tried to provide limited local control. Meanwhile, the small Labour minority in Parliament was sympathetic to the Congress movement led by Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru. Decolonisation was never a major election issue; Labour was not officially in favour of decolonisation when it was elected in 1945. With violence escalating in India after the war, but with British financial power at a low ebb, large-scale military involvement was impossible. The Viceroy of India warned he needed a further seven army divisions to prevent communal violence if independence negotiations failed. None were available, so political restructuring was accelerated. The Labour government gave independence to India and Pakistan in an unexpectedly quick move in 1947. One recent historian and Conservative party sympathiser Andrew Roberts says the independence of India was a  national humiliation  but it was necessitated by urgent financial, administrative, strategic and political needs. Whereas Churchill in 1940 45 had tightened the hold on India and imprisoned the Congress leadership, Labour had looked forward to making it a fully independent dominion like Canada or Australia.",

Many of the Congress leaders in India had studied in England, and were highly regarded as fellow idealistic socialists by Labour leaders. Attlee was the Labour expert on India and took special charge of decolonization. Attlee found that Churchill's viceroy, Field Marshal Archibald Wavell, was too imperialistic, too keen on military solutions (he wanted seven more Army divisions) and too neglectful of Indian political alignments. The new Viceroy was Lord Mountbatten, the dashing war hero and a cousin of King George VI. The boundary between the newly created states of Pakistan and India involved the widespread resettlement of millions of Muslims and Hindus (and many Sikhs). Extreme violence ensued when Punjab and Bengal provinces were split. Historian Yasmin Khan estimates that between a half-million and a million men, women and children were killed.

A major reason that Churchill was in the wilderness during the 1930s was his refusal to support the Conservative position in favor of independence for India. Independence strengthened the Commonwealth of Nations, and had a valuable impact on the British economy, with large sums transferring back and forth, as well as fresh migrants arriving from India. In sharp contrast, France felt humiliated by its loss of its colonial empire, especially Algeria and Vietnam. The success in India encouraged and embolden the development programs of ambitious young British colonial officials in Africa and the rest of Asia. In sharp contrast, the British people were disappointed with their humiliation in Mandatory Palestine. They had managed to alienate both sides. Arabs and Jews had been fighting for years, in nasty conflicts that were still fierce seven decades later.

In November 1956, after months of negotiation and attempts at mediation had failed to dissuade Nasser, Britain and France, in conjunction with Israel, invaded Egypt and occupied the Suez Canal Zone. Dwight D. Eisenhower had warned Eden not to do it, saying the American people would never approve of a military solution to the crisis. He threatened to use financial pressure unless the British withdrew from Egypt. Eden had ignored Britain's financial dependence on the US in the wake of World War II, and was forced to bow to American pressure to withdraw. Eden had poor staff support because the Foreign Office, Commonwealth Relations Office, and Colonial Office had been slow to realise the need for change in Britain's world role. After Suez they started to heed Treasury warnings about the effect of high defence expenditure on the economy, and the slow growth of the British population compared with the United States and the Soviet Union. Historians often use the crisis to mark the end of Britain's status as a superpower, being able to act and control international affairs without assistance or coalition.

Their advice was rejected and in January 1958, all the Treasury ministers resigned. Macmillan brushed aside this incident as 'a little local difficulty'. Macmillan wanted the new National Incomes Commission to institute controls on income as part of his growth without inflation policy; it failed when the trade unions boycotted it. One of Macmillan's more noteworthy actions was the end of conscription. National Service ended gradually from 1957; in November 1960 the last men entered service.

Britain, the US, and the Soviet Union signed the Partial Test Ban Treaty in autumn 1963. Britain's application to join the Common Market was vetoed by French President Charles de Gaulle on 29 January 1963, in due to his fear that 'the end would be a colossal Atlantic Community dependent on America', and personal anger at the Anglo-American nuclear deal. Britain's balance of payments problems led to the imposition of a seven-month wage freeze in 1961. This caused the government to lose popularity and led to a series of by-election defeats.

In July 1965, Edward Heath defeated Reginald Maudling and Enoch Powell to succeed him as Conservative Party leader. Enoch Powell was given the post of Shadow Defence Secretary and became a figure of national prominence when he made the controversial Rivers of Blood speech in 1968, warning on the dangers of mass immigration from Commonwealth nations. It is possible that the Conservatives' success in the 1970 general election was a result of the large public following Powell attained, even as he was sacked from the shadow cabinet. Thirteen Wasted Years! Thirteen Wasted Years! was a popular slogan attacking the Conservative record 1951 1964. Criticism came primarily from Labour. In addition there were attacks by the right wing of the Conservative Party itself for its tolerance of socialist policies.

Labour Government, 1964 1970\nHarold Wilson\nIn 1964, Labour regained the premiership, as Harold Wilson narrowly won the general election with a majority of five. This was not sufficient to last for a full term and, after a short period of competent government, in March 1966, he won re-election with a landslide majority of 99. As prime minister, his opponents accused him of deviousness, especially over the matter of devaluation of the pound in November 1967. Wilson had rejected devaluation for many years, yet in his broadcast had seemed to present it as a triumph. Open University\nWilson regarded with special pride setting up the Open University as a model for Europe. Plans were drafted by Jennie Lee, the Minister for the Arts; she had Wilson's full support. He saw the Open University as a major marker of the Labour Party's commitment to modernisation. He emphasised that it would strengthen a more competitive economy while also fostering greater equality of opportunity and social mobility.",

There were strong doubters and opponents in the government and in commercial broadcasting; Wilson outmaneuvered them to get the budget approved, even though its sums proved far too small. Vietnam War\nOverseas, Wilson was troubled by crises in Rhodesia and South Africa. The Vietnam War was a delicate issue, as President Lyndon B. Johnson urgently needed a symbolic British military presence. Lyndon Johnson is begging me even to send a bagpipe band to Vietnam,  Wilson told his Cabinet in December 1964. Labour decided not to antagonise its strong antiwar element and refused Johnson's pleas. However, Wilson provided the Americans with intelligence, military weapons, and jungle training, and allowed some 2000 British soldiers to volunteer for service in Vietnam. Industrial strike\nIn addition to the damage done to its reputation by devaluation, Wilson's Government suffered from the perception that its response to industrial relations problems was inadequate. A six-week strike of members of the National Union of Seamen, which began shortly after Wilson' re-election in 1966, did much to reinforce this perception, along with Wilson's own sense of insecurity in office.",

In 2003, he gave evidence to the Saville Inquiry and claimed that he never promoted or agreed to the use of unlawful lethal force in Northern Ireland. In July 1972, he permitted his Secretary of State for Northern Ireland William Whitelaw to hold unofficial talks in London with a Provisional Irish Republican Army delegation by Seán Mac Stíofáin. In the aftermath of these unsuccessful talks, the Heath government pushed for a peaceful settlement with the democratic political parties.

It was, says biographer John Campbell,  Heath's finest hour. Meanwhile, on the domestic front, galloping inflation led him into confrontation with some of the most powerful trade unions. Energy shortages related to the oil shock resulted in much of the country's industry working a Three-Day Week to conserve power. In an attempt to bolster his government, Heath called an election for 28 February 1974. The result was inconclusive: the Conservative Party received a plurality of votes cast, but the Labour Party gained a plurality of seats due to the Ulster Unionist MPs refusing to support the Conservatives. Heath began negotiations with the Liberal Party under Jeremy Thorpe to form a coalition, but, when these failed, resigned as prime minister.

It was a manifesto pledge in the general election of February 1974 for a Labour government to re-negotiate better terms for British membership in the European Economic Area, and then hold a referendum on whether Britain should stay in the EEC on the new terms. After the House of Commons voted in favour of retaining the Common Market on the renegotiated terms, a referendum was held on 5 June 1975. A majority were in favour of retaining the Common Market. But Wilson was not able to end the economic crisis. Unemployment remained well in excess of 1,000,000, inflation peaked at 24  in 1975, and the national debt was increasing.

Callaghan was the first prime minister to have held all three leading Cabinet positions   Chancellor of the Exchequer, home secretary and foreign secretary   prior to becoming prime minister. Callaghan's support for and from the union movement should not be mistaken for a left-wing position. Callaghan continued Wilson's policy of a balanced Cabinet and relied heavily on Michael Foot. Foot was made Leader of the House of Commons and given the task of steering through the government's legislative programme. Callaghan's time as prime minister was dominated by the troubles in running a government with a minority in the House of Commons; by-election defeats had wiped out Labour's three-seat majority by early 1977. Callaghan was forced to make deals with minor parties in order to survive, including the Lib Lab pact.

The Trade Unions rejected continued pay restraint and in a succession of strikes over the winter of 1978 79 (known as the Winter of Discontent) secured higher pay, although it had virtually paralysed the country, tarnished Britain's political reputation and seen the Conservatives surge ahead in the opinion polls.

Historian Kenneth O. Morgan states:\nThe fall of James Callaghan in the summer of 1979 meant, according to most commentators across the political spectrum, the end of an ancien régime, a system of corporatism, Keynesian spending programmes, subsidized welfare, and trade union power. Historians Alan Sked and Chris Cook have summarised the general consensus of historians regarding Labour in power in the 1970s:\nIf Wilson's record as prime minister was soon felt to have been one of failure, that sense of failure was powerfully reinforced by Callaghan's term as premier. Labour, it seemed, was incapable of positive achievements. It was unable to control inflation, unable to control the unions, unable to solve the Irish problem, unable to solve the Rhodesian question, unable to secure its proposals for Welsh and Scottish devolution, unable to reach a popular modus vivendi with the Common Market, unable even to maintain itself in power until it could go to the country and the date of its own choosing.

    "text": "The Nigerian Television Authority or NTA is a Nigerian government-owned and partly commercial broadcast station. Originally known as Nigerian Television (NTV), it was inaugurated in 1977 with a monopoly on national television broadcasting, after a takeover of regional television stations by military governmental authorities in 1976. After a declining interest from the public in government-influenced programming, it lost its monopoly over television broadcasting in Nigeria in the 1990s. The NTA runs the largest television network in Nigeria with stations in several parts of the country. It is widely viewed as the  authentic voice  of the Nigerian government. History\nEarly broadcast stations in Nigeria\nThe first television station in Nigeria, the Western Nigerian Government Broadcasting Corporation (WNTV) began broadcasting on 31 October 1959. Its first Chairman was Olapade Obisesan, a lawyer trained in the United Kingdom and the son of Akinpelu Obisesan, an Ibadan socialite and first president of the Cooperative Bank of Nigeria. Vincent Maduka, a former engineer, was the General Manager. The station was based in Ibadan, making it the first broadcast station in tropical Africa. In March 1962, Radio-Television Kaduna Radio Kaduna Television (RKTV) was established. It was based in Kaduna and was operated by the Broadcasting Company of Northern Nigeria.",

RKTV also provided coverage for the central northern states; it opened new stations on Zaria in July 1962 and on Kano in February 1963. Later in 1977, it was re-branded NTV-Kaduna. In April 1962, the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) was established as a federal government-owned service based in the city of Lagos, broadcasting to the southwestern states. MidWest TV was established in 1972 as a TV broadcaster of Port Harcourt. It was run by the state government in Benin. Benue-Plateau Television Corporation (BPTV) was established in 1974 with headquarters in Jos. It was the first television station to launch regular permanent colour broadcasts in Africa. The colour test transmissions began on 1 October 1975. BPTV was later re-branded as NTV-Jos. NTA was founded in 1977. By May 1977 all the state television broadcasters listed above were merged and re-branded as Nigerian Television (NTV) and owned by the Nigerian Television Authority. Obisesan and Makuda continued in the roles of Chairman and General Manager of NTA. As of 1979, NTA had a national reach of 20  of the Nigerian population.",

Early programming\n1977 1990: Networking locally produced content\nDramatic programming such as serials and anthology series were rare in regional television stations before NTA was founded in 1977. TV shows such as Moses Olaiya's Alawada on WNTV (later NTA Ibadan), Village Headmaster and Hotel de Jordan on NTA Benin became available more widely after the merger. Apart from these few notable shows, there was little original content in dramatic series production during the 1970s. By 1980, when the new NTA network took over state-owned broadcasting stations in the country, there was a concerted effort to increase the quality of locally produced content. NTA began offering support to the production of notable country-wide network programs such as Tales by Moonlight, Cockcrow at Dawn, and Mirror in the Sun as early as 1977. In 1982, a drama produced by NTA Sokoto, Moment of Truth won a prize at the fifth URTNA festival held in Algiers.",

To cultivate interest in original broadcast content from Nigerian producers, the network set a ceiling of 20  broadcasting time to be allocated to foreign programming, during a period when the cost of acquiring those programs was much less than the locally produced ones. With just a portion of the broadcast week for schedulers to work with, foreign imports were routinely some of the most popular shows from the UK and the U.S., such as Yes Minister, Charlie's Angels, Dallas, Dynasty, and Falcon Crest. Cockcrow at Dawn, an agriculture promotional drama partially sponsored by UBA and produced by Peter Igho, who directed the award-winning Moment of Truth, emerged as one of the first nationally televised drama series in Nigeria. However, it was short-lived due to  government structure syndrome . Acada Campus, a show produced by Bode Sowande, was also short-lived. These series were widely available thanks to NTA's monopoly on broadcasting. In the 1980s, a series of critically acclaimed soap operas were promoted on the network. The first was Laolu Ogunniyi's Wind Against My Soul, followed by For Better or Worse and Lola Fani Kayode's Mirror in the Sun.",

In the mid-1980s, another group of soap operas dominated the airwaves, including the short-lived Behind the Clouds and Turning Wheels. In 1984, NTA began to broadcast Tales by Moonlight, a children's programme narrating traditional African folklore stories. The network also broadcast Adelia Onyedibia's adaptation of Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart in 1986. The network also promoted notable comedy series during this period such as New Masquerade and Ken Saro Wiwa's Basi and Company. One of the earliest network comedies was House no. 13 (1984) starring Wale Ogunyemi;, a sitcom satirizing the social and urban lifestyle of Nigerians. Basi and Company, a critically acclaimed comedy series starring Albert Egbe was broadcast in 1985.

Village Headmaster, Koko Close and Samanja, three series spoken in Nigerian Pidgin, were aired nationwide. 1990s: Partial commercialization\nUnder the structural adjustment program initiated by the government of Ibrahim Babangida, NTA was required to commercialize some of its time slots in an attempt to move away from public broadcasting towards a partially commercial broadcasting network. This led to the addition of sponsored and brokered religious programs and the live transmission of weddings and funeral services on the network. NTA also continued to show acclaimed soap operas such as Mind Bending by Lola Fani-Kayode, Ripples by Zeb Ejiro and Checkmate by Amaka Igwe. Ripples, which began in 1988, became the network's longest-running soap opera, ending in 1993. Checkmate by Amaka Igwe, starring Richard Mofe Damijo, Bob-Manuel Udokwu, Ego Boyo, Kunle Bamtefa and Mildred Iweka, launched the career of many Nigerian celebrities. Following the end of Ripples and Checkmate, NTA promoted the shows Blossom and Fortunes, but these series suffered from declining viewership.

The network ensured that news presenters did not simply read prepared scripts but acted as part of the news gathering team. As many of their early news writers came from print journalism, NTA made sure that writers understood the importance of writing for visual presentation. NTA introduced a new line of newscasters and reporters such as Ronke Ayuba, John Momoh, Cyril Stober, Bimbo Oloyede, Ruth Opia, Sienne Allwell-Brown and Sola Omole. Specialized news programmes like Frank Olise's Newsline were also introduced.

NTA has faced criticism that the content it covers is influenced by government and politicians. This interference is said to diminish the professionalism of newscasters on NTA. The NTA has been criticized by performing artists such as Becky Umeh for allegedly pressuring her and other artists to align their expression with government propaganda goals. In an editorial on 18 October 2009, the Lagos newspaper The Guardian stated that  the federal government-owned television network, the Nigerian Television Authority, (NTA) is arguably the largest of its type in Africa, but it is yet to have the operational freedom required to maximize its potential.",

    "text": "The 16th National Basketball Association All-Star Game was played on January 11, 1966, at Cincinnati Gardens in Cincinnati. The coaches were Red Auerbach for the East, and Fred Schaus for the West. Much of the game would focus around the local team's three named All-Stars. Cincinnati's Oscar Robertson had been named the event's MVP in 1964, and Cincinnati's Jerry Lucas had been named MVP in 1965. At game time, the East Division's top three teams, Boston, Philadelphia and Cincinnati, had the three best records in the league, with New York trailing far behind. This led East Coach Red Auerbach to name Cincinnati's Adrian Smith as a reserve and not New York's sharpshooting Dick Barnett, a source of some controversy at the time. The home crowd rallied behind Smith as he emerged as the game's star. It was Smith's only All-Star appearance, and he remains to-date the only one-time NBA All-Star ever named the event's MVP. The overmatched West suffered not just from poor shooting, but also from losing key All-Star Jerry West to an eye injury in the first quarter.

    "text": "Key Club International, also called Key Club, is an international service organization for high school students. Key Club International is the high school branch of the Kiwanis International family, classified as a Service Leadership Program and more specifically as a Kiwanis Youth Program. Many Key Clubs are sponsored by a local Kiwanis club. The organization was started by California State Commissioner of Schools Albert C. Olney and vocational education teacher Frank C. Vincent, who worked together to establish the first Key Club at Sacramento High School in California on May 7, 1925. Female students were first admitted in 1977, ten years before women were admitted to the sponsoring organization, Kiwanis International. Key Club International began a 100-day countdown celebration leading up to the 100th anniversary in 2025 with celebratory events throughout the country prior to the Key Club International Convention. History\nOrigin\nIn 1924, the local Kiwanis Club decided to attempt to begin a service club at the Sacramento High School, and the school principal supported the idea and began searching for students willing to start the club. In May 1925, a group of boys at Sacramento High School held their first club meeting. Inclusivity\nFemale students were first allowed to join in 1977 (52 years after the founding of the organization). This occurred ten years before adult women were permitted to join the parent (sponsoring) organization, Kiwanis International.",

    "text": "Piece by Piece  is a song written by American singer Kelly Clarkson taken from her seventh studio album of the same name. She co-wrote the track with producer Greg Kurstin. A midtempo pop song about restoring someone's faith in love and family relationships, Clarkson promulgated  Piece by Piece  as a sequel to the song  Because of You  (2004) but with a  happy ending . After a discussion with her sister about their family life, she introspectively co-wrote the song in a first-person narrative to her father, whose neglect of his family was used as a juxtaposition to her then-husband Brandon Blackstock's unconditional love for her and their daughter, whom they both promised to never abandon. Piece by Piece  was first released as the second promotional single from Piece by Piece by RCA Records on February 24, 2015. Upon its release, the title track received praise from music critics, who commended its lyrical content as one of the album's highlights. Clarkson premiered the song in a live acoustic performance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and has showcased it on the set list of the Piece by Piece Tour. A re-worked version of the track was released to American hot adult contemporary radio stations on November 9, 2015, as the third and final single from the album.",

On February 25, 2016, Clarkson performed  Piece by Piece  in a live presentation on the fifteenth season of American Idol. The successful commercial and critical response of her performance on the program led RCA to issue an  Idol version  of the track on February 29, 2016. The combined versions of  Piece by Piece  allowed the song to debut on the Billboard Hot 100 chart at number eight, becoming Clarkson's eleventh top ten entry and tying itself with  Never Again  (2007) as her highest debut on the chart. The track also attained the top position on three Billboard charts primarily the Billboard Digital Songs chart, becoming Clarkson's 100th song to reach number one on a Billboard chart a milestone in her musical career. Piece by Piece  also peaked within the top 30 of the music charts of Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and Scotland. Clarkson later performed a reprise of the Idol version on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on March 3, 2016. The Idol version was nominated for Best Pop Solo Performance at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards. Following her 2022 divorce from Blackstock, Clarkson rewrote the lyrics in 2023 for live performances to reflect her new self-worth as a single mother.",

    "text": "Following her 2022 divorce from Blackstock, Clarkson rewrote the lyrics in 2023 for live performances to reflect her new self-worth as a single mother. Composition\nOne of the five songs she had written for her seventh studio album, Clarkson co-wrote  Piece by Piece  with frequent collaborator Greg Kurstin, who produced the track. Clarkson has said about writing the song: A lot of the reasons why I wrote  Piece by Piece  was I guess I didn't realize the gravity of the situation until I had a child of my own, and until I experienced love like I do with Brandon (Blackstock) on the daily basis. I guess you don't realize something is missing until you feel it. I can't imagine walking away from my little girl. I can't imagine not having that love anymore. I didn't know it was missing because I never had it. It was a revelation and that's why I wrote that song. I think a lot of people go through that. Lyrically, the song is a midtempo pop number about restoring someone's faith in love and family relationships. The song starts with a woman's recollection of her father abandoning his family; by the chorus, she finds a new man in her life, whom she describes as someone who,  piece by piece , had restored her  faith that a man can be kind and a father could stay .",

    "text": "Written in a first-person narrative, Clarkson introspectively co-wrote the song to her father, whose abandonment of his family when she was six years old was utilized as a juxtaposition in contrast to her husband's unconditional love to her and their daughter, whom they had both promised in the song to never leave behind. Clarkson pegged  Piece by Piece  as a follow-up song to her 2004 track  Because of You  and the album's  most personal  record, saying that  once you've worked through that and you find love and the kind of happiness you hoped for but didn't really know was possible. It's a happy song. And it has a happy ending, unlike 'Because of You' . She revealed that she was inspired to write it after a discussion with her sister about their relationships with their respective families. She remarked,  I was talking to my sister on the phone about how sometimes girls with daddy issues don't find men like that! . Clarkson also noted how their husbands were so supportive and loving in stark contrast to the cliché about people with  abandonment issues  dating  losers . She also said that  Piece by Piece  is a positive song, despite its somber resonance, and that she's still grateful to her father for making her want to be much more present in her family. Sonically, Jon Pareles of The New York Times compared it to the anthems recorded by U2.",

Lyrics change\nIn August 2023, at her Las Vegas residency, Clarkson amended the lyrics from  But piece by piece, he collected me up   Off the ground, where you abandoned things, yeah   Piece by piece, he filled the holes that you burned in me   At 6 years old and you know,  to  I collected me up  and  I filled the holes, . The previous positive song is now a post-heartbreak empowering song as Clarkson switches from  he  to  I . Also, Clarkson switched the lyrics to the chorus from  He never walks away   He never asks for money   He takes care of me   He loves me. to  I just walk away   when they ask for money   I take care of me   'cause I love me. This chorus change seems to address the main point of content: money from Clarkson's 2022 divorce settlement from Blackstock. In an interview on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, Clarkson admitted that she changed the lyrics because she found it difficult to sing the original version live while reliving the heartbreak she endured in the divorce, and added that the  healing  rewrite gave her some clarity and allowed her to evaluate her newfound self-worth and empower her fanbase.",

Clarkson also revealed plans for the song to receive a single release. RCA then commissioned a re-worked version of the track for commercial release, which was serviced to hot adult contemporary radio stations on November 9, 2015 as the third single from the album. Following Clarkson's performance on American Idol, RCA issued an Idol version with Clarkson recording a similar performance in studio accompanied by a piano by Jason Halbert and produced and mixed by Halbert on February 29, 2016. Critical response\n Piece by Piece  received acclaim from music critics, who praised it as one of the album's highlights for its lyrical content. Reviewing for Billboard, Jamieson Cox regarded the song as a raw and standout vocal showcase, saying that when Clarkson forges a real emotional connection with the track, it allows the album to transcend hammier and hackneyed moments in between. In his review for The New York Times, Pareles described it as the album's most accusatory song; and noted that despite the lyrical vulnerability, its music rises quickly to bombast, triumphal and glamorous but remote. He also lamented that those moments are far too few in the album.",

Writing for AXS on its release, Chase Hunt singled out  Piece by Piece  as the one that feels more natural than the rest of the album's tracks. He wrote,  Songs penned by  Clarkson , or any artist writing their own songs, feels different. The track is letting fans into her soul while telling more of her story, past and present. Katherine St. Asaph of Time also highlighted the song as one of the album's stronger moments, describing it as a dagger to deadbeat dads everywhere that marks her most pointed lyrics since Stronger's  You Love Me  (2011). AllMusic's senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine also included it as one of the three tracks (along with  Nostalgic  and  Good Goes the Bye ) that strike the correct balance of Clarkson's indomitable character and fresh electronic beats on the album's production. Jim Farber of the New York Daily News highlighted the song as one of the two (along with  Someone ) that show Clarkson's flair for the passive aggressive put-down and help focus on her persona. Reviewing the album for The A.V. Club, Annie Zaleski also commended the track as one of those where Clarkson is far more engaging, and commented that the album could use more of that emotional complexity and personal connection.",

The faction joined the Southern Operations Room in December 2024 following the 2024 Syrian opposition offensives and disbanded in April 2025 after the killing of Bilal al-Droubi. Background\nThe Eighth Brigade originated as the Syrian rebel group Youth of Sunna Forces, which was initially led by Ahmad al-Awda until Mohammed Tohme and his deputy Bilal al-Droubi were given control of the group by the factions' leadership council in August 2016. Al-Awda regained control of the group and the city of Bosra later that month with the support of the Yarmouk Army. History\nFollowing a marked increase in regime activity in the summer of 2018, al-Awda negotiated a settlement with Russia and was given control of his own brigade. The faction worked closely with Russian military police and their joint area of control was more peaceful compared to other areas of the governorate.",

He was the father of Bruce McCandless, also a naval officer, and the grandfather of NASA astronaut Bruce McCandless II. Commodore McCandless was later promoted to the rank of Rear Admiral on the retired list. Family and early life\nByron McCandless was born in Endicott, Nebraska. His grandfather was David McCanles, who was killed by Wild Bill Hickok in 1861 at the Rock Creek Station, Nebraska shoot-out. His father was Julius McCandless (born 1851), who later moved his family to Florence, Colorado, where he operated a hardware store. (Florence had been founded by one of Julius' uncles, James McCandless, and named for one of James' daughters.)\nByron McCandless attended the Colorado School of Mines, and in 1899 played one season as quarterback for the University of Colorado football team. He later went to the United States Naval Academy where he graduated in 1905.",

Naval career\nFollowing his graduation from the United States Naval Academy in 1905, McCandless sailed with the Great White Fleet on the USS Maine. He was a gunnery and turret officer, and later became the flag lieutenant and aide to Rear Admiral Charles J. Badger, the commander of the Atlantic Fleet. When Admiral William S. Benson became the first Chief of Naval Operations in 1915, he chose McCandless to be on his three-person staff. Later, McCandless also became an aide to Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels. During World War I, McCandless commanded the destroyer USS Caldwell, and was awarded the Navy Cross.",

After the war, McCandless was the executive officer on the battleship USS Kansas. He later commanded the USS Parrott from 1921 to 1923, the oiler USS Brazos in 1927-28, and the cruiser USS Raleigh. McCandless also commanded Destroyer Division 30 and served as the Operations Officer for Destroyer Squadrons of the Scouting Fleet. McCandless attended the Naval War College, then became the Director of the Training Division in the Navy's Bureau of Navigation, and later headed the Branch Hydrographic Office in Boston. After completing another course at the Naval War College, he served as the Chief of Staff for Destroyers, Battle Force, from 1935 to 1937.

He was transferred to the retired list on June 30, 1940, but remained on active duty and in command. He oversaw an expansion in scope of the base, adding fleet training schools and an amphibious force training unit, and accordingly it was renamed the Repair Base, San Diego, in 1942. Helped by the addition of several floating dry docks, between 1943 and 1945 the base performed conversion, overhaul, maintenance and battle damage repair to more than 5,000 ships. He remained the commander until the end of the war, leaving on September 8, 1945. For his service at the base, McCandless was awarded the Legion of Merit. He retired on September 25, 1946. During his career, McCandless made several inventions. One of them was the  Jeheemy , an apparatus used to salvage landing craft swamped and stranded on invasion beachheads. It consisted of portable crane hauled along the beach by a tractor.

Vexillology\nMcCandless developed in interest in flags, a field later called vexillology, and in 1917 was described by National Geographic Magazine as the  foremost flag expert of the United States Government and probably the leading authority in the world on flag usages among maritime nations . McCandless authored almost the entire October 1917 issue of National Geographic, their  Flag Number , depicting nearly 1200 world flags in color and including a history of the American flag. In 1923, McCandless discovered the 1779 Dutch sketches of the Serapis flag in the records of the Chicago Historical Society, removing any doubt as to what the flags actually looked like. In 1915, Woodrow Wilson decided to design a new flag for the presidency, replacing the separate flags then in use by the Army and the Navy. McCandless, the Aide to the Secretary of the Navy at the time, participated in the discussions along with Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt and Assistant Secretary of War Henry Breckinridge. McCandless suggested a design which added four stars to the Navy's version (which used the Great Seal on a blue background), as this would be enough to distinguish it from the Army infantry flag.",

McCandless then met with Wilson to demonstrate the proposed design; Wilson liked it but wanted to use the eagle from the presidential seal instead. This became the final design, and Wilson issued Executive Order 2390 on May 29, 1916, to officially define it. In March 1945, Franklin Roosevelt wondered if the four stars were still appropriate, given the creation of the five-star Fleet Admiral and General of the Army ranks during World War II. Despite initial responses which recommended no change (the stars were not supposed to be indicative of rank), Roosevelt persisted and had a message sent to his old colleague McCandless, by this time a Commodore and commanding the Naval Repair Base in San Diego. Roosevelt died on April 12 before McCandless could reply, but Truman still expressed interest, so on May 29 McCandless sent a long letter containing a history of the President's flag, dozens of attachments and several recommendations for a redesign. McCandless primarily suggested using four six-pointed stars, each made up with twelve smaller stars. The six stars would indicate a higher rank, while the 48 total stars would represent the states.",

The six stars would indicate a higher rank, while the 48 total stars would represent the states. Truman (as a civilian) did not like the idea of designating rank, so instead requested a simple circle of 48 stars. McCandless accordingly made up a new drawing with this design. Further alterations (turning the eagle's head to its right, and changing the eagle to full color) were made by Arthur E. DuBois of the Heraldic Section of the Army's Office of the Quartermaster General (the forerunner of the Army Institute of Heraldry). This design was used for the presidential coat of arms, seal, and flag, and was officially defined with Executive Order 9646 issued on October 25, 1945. The accompanying press release discussed McCandless' role at length. It is still the current design for the presidential seal and flag, as the only changes since have been to add more stars after Alaska and Hawaii became states. In 1962, McCandless began writing an extensive book on the Flag of the United States in collaboration with Annapolis classmate Rear Admiral William R. Furlong, but died in 1967 well before the book was finished.",

    "text": "Dancing on My Own  is a song by Swedish singer-songwriter Robyn, released on 20 April 2010 as the lead single from her fifth studio album, Body Talk Pt. 1 (2010), the first in her Body Talk series. Dancing on My Own  was produced by Patrik Berger, co-produced by Robyn, and mixed by Niklas Flyckt, with Robyn and Patrik sharing writing credits. The song's stark mid-tempo electropop version from her album was the first version of the single released followed by a layered mid-tempo synth-pop edit designed for radio and a downtempo piano ballad recording for Radio 1's Live Lounge   Volume 5 later that year. It depicts a female protagonist in a crowded club just before last call who is dancing on her own while watching her ex-boyfriend, who she sought out, dancing with and embracing another woman, pondering confronting him for the last time before her time runs out. The song was inspired by situations Robyn observed while on her previous tour then clubbing throughout Stockholm, her favorite  inherently sad gay disco anthems , and the dissolution of her engagement. Critics praised  Dancing on My Own  as another bittersweet anthem for her song canon, with some ranking it as the greatest song of the year and eventually, the decade.",

Several reassessed its influence as Robyn's signature song, a gay anthem, and  the ultimate sad banger  of the poptimist movement, with Rolling Stone ranking her original album version at number 20 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time in 2021. Dancing on My Own  became Robyn's first number one in her native country following its live premiere on Swedish TV show Sommarkrysset and also reached the top ten in Denmark, Norway and the United Kingdom later that month. Frequent collaborator Max Vitali directed  Dancing on My Own 's Rosie Perez-inspired music video, first released on 21 May 2010, that showed Robyn portraying the protagonist in the song's lyrics in various club and rehearsal settings. The song later earned a nomination for Best Dance Recording at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards and was awarded Best Song at the Grammisgalan in Sweden. All three of her song's versions were promoted well into the following decade through multiple televised and streamed live performances and inclusion on many films, television series, and commercials.

Inspired by the downtempo Southern rock ballad cover of it performed (but not released) by band Kings of Leon, a downtempo AC ballad by Britain's Got Talent contestant Calum Scott was most prominently released on 15 April 2016. Scott's cover was a moderate sleeper hit throughout Europe following substantial success in the UK, where it went viral on streaming services despite little initial radio play. Critical reception to it was polarized, with Robyn praising the cover but prominent music journalists comparing it negatively to her original. The first major test release by controversial London-based AI algorithm-based A R start-up Instrumental, its formula in finding Scott and releasing his cover would go on to revolutionize major label signing based on early Internet engagement.

The song's second synth-pop version, designed for radio and first heard accompanying its music video when it premiered on 21 May 2010, was released as a bonus track to Body Talk Pt. 1's iTunes release on 11 June 2010. It mixes those elements at substantially different levels and most noticeably adds  an extra arpeggiated synth through the intro and the verse . James Montgomery of MTV News described the radio version as  a computerized kaleidoscope of chippy, chiming blips and piston-like drums. Vanyaland's Michael Marotta pointed out a small bell effect resembling last call that rings at the climax of the song in both electronic versions' middle 8, interpreting its inclusion as an indication the protagonist's time had run out in her last effort to gain notice from the ex-lover.",

Robyn portrays the protagonist depicted in the song's lyrics while lip-syncing its lines in three scenes in the center of the club's dance floor, in a dark hallway of that club and in a separate  harshly lit rehearsal  setting. The microphone stand with no microphone in the latter setting BBC's Fraser McAlpine argued was a deliberate direction as a metaphor for the song's narrative. Robyn is occasionally watching her ex with another woman and trying to get his attention in both club settings prior to leaving   though not overtly, nor is there an obvious reference in the video as to who the ex and his girlfriend are among the club goers.",

By the late 2010s out singer songwriter Sam Smith expressed that they thought the track made Robyn  a huge part of the LGBTQ community because we get to dance our pain away. Rolling Stone ranked  Dancing on My Own  at number 20 on their list of  25 Essential LGBTQ Pride Songs , describing the song as  deeply resonant to queer, marginalized people.

In March 2018, Scott revisited the mixed reactions to his version. He said that those complaining he had ruined Robyn's song were counterbalanced by positive responses, for instance one person that had  just written to me and said that they've come out to their family because of my interpretation . He said he  didn't change the pronouns of the song  because he wanted the interpretation to always come from a  gay man's perspective . He said the gay community have thanked him repeatedly for the song, saying  how much it means to them that they have a voice in music.

The Butler-Wallin House, built in 1928-1929, is a one-and-a-half-story Period Revival-style residence. The house is significant under Criteria A for its association with the agricultural and suburban development of central Salt Lake County. The Butler-Wallin House was originally built as the showpiece of a 35-acre farm. The house and farm had several owners during the historic period, and each had different agricultural use for the property. The farm acreage land was sold for residential development between the 1950s and 1980s, but the house remains a distinctive reminder of the neighborhood's agricultural heritage. The Butler-Wallin House is a rare example of a farmhouse that represents a subset of second-generation Salt Lake County residents, the  gentlemen  farmers. Prosperous businessmen, who like Robert Butler and Alvin G. Wallin, kept their in-town jobs while maintaining suburban farms for hobby, experimentation, and educational purposes. The Butler-Wallin House is also significant under Criterion C as an architectural landmark in the area. The Butler-Wallin House was designed by the first owner, Robert W.

    "text": "Blackstone Military Academy, a military school located in the town of Blackstone in Nottoway County, Virginia, was founded in 1912 and located off South Main Street in Blackstone itself. The exact coordinates of its former location are: Latitude: 37.0709835, Longitude: -78.0047258. These coordinates place it as having been to the immediate East of present-day Blackstone Army Airfield. The establishment of BMA occurred when Hodge Military Academy, a school that had been located on those same grounds since 1894, closed. BMA suffered a fire at one time in its history, but the school was rebuilt in 1922. BMA eventually closed, and the building that once served as the barracks for attending cadets functions today as the Clay's Rest Home. Blackstone Military Academy responded liberally to the subscriptions for the Soldiers' Library fund as well as to many other causes. Mrs. E. S. Ligon has the following to say of the work of the academy:\n'Blackstone Military Academy was headquarters of the Nottoway Soldiers' Comfort League, and it was here that the members frequently met to wrap, address and send the sweaters to the Nottoway boys. On these occasions news of our boys was exchanged and letters read from those who had received the league's gifts. From the faculty and cadet corps of B. M. A.",

It enters the state at the Alabama state line near West Point, and Lanett, Alabama, traveling through the Atlanta metropolitan area and to the South Carolina state line, where it crosses the Savannah River near Lake Hartwell. I-85 connects North Georgia with Montgomery, Alabama, to the southwest, and with South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia to the northeast. Within Georgia, I-85 is also designated as the unsigned State Route 403 (SR 403). I-85 in Georgia usually travels roughly parallel with the route of US Route 29 (US 29). However, from Atlanta northeast to South Carolina, I-85 ventures away from that route, traveling about halfway between US 29 and the combination of US 23 and US 123. Within the city of Atlanta, I-85 has a concurrency with I-75 known as the  Downtown Connector . After splitting from Downtown Connector, it is known as Northeast Expressway until its junction with I-285 (The Perimeter). Route description\nAlabama state line to I-185\nI-85 enters the state of Georgia from Alabama via twin bridges over the Chattahoochee River, and then it immediately skirts the town of West Point, with Kia's multibillion-dollar plant located adjacent to the freeway just east of West Point.",

Northeast of LaGrange, I-85 has an interchange with the long spur freeway, I-185, to the Columbus metropolitan area. This is the only connection between Columbus and the Interstate Highway System. An 18-mile (29 km) stretch between the Alabama line and exit 18 in LaGrange is serving as an environmental and technological testbed for a project called The Ray, a partnership involving federal and state officials, the private sector, academia and philanthropic organizations. Among the projects are a solar-paved roadway, enhanced road striping for autonomous vehicles, and plantings along the right-of-way to improve runoff and possibly serve as a harvestable crop. From I-185 to Atlanta\nFrom LaGrange, I-85 heads northeastward toward Atlanta. Before reaching Atlanta, the highway crosses the CSX Transportation A WP Subdivision twice (in the Grantville area) and passes through the suburbs of Moreland, Newnan, Fairburn, and Union City. The highway then intersects I-285 at its southwest end in College Park. This interchange is one of the most complex interchanges in the country, as I-285 and I-85 stay side by side through the interchange, which actually has two parts.",

Tolls are collected using an electronic toll collection system. All travelers that use the lane must have a Peach Pass sticker to avoid fines. Starting in November 2014, SunPass (Florida) and NC Quick Pass (North Carolina) are interoperable with Peach Pass, allowing motorists with those transponders to use the express lanes. On November 3, 2018, an extension to the express lanes opened, from its former ending at Old Peachtree Road to Hamilton Mill Road (exit 120). After this extension, four more northbound exit points were added: at SR 317 (exit 111), I-985 (exit 113), SR 20 (exit 115), and at its end at Hamilton Mill Road (exit 120).

    "text": "The project costed  178 million (equivalent to  218 million in 2024). The express lanes extension will incur a separate charge from the existing express lanes. This is to decrease the impact of high congestion on the existing express lanes on the dynamic pricing of the express lanes extension, since lower congestion is expected on the new extension of the express lanes. Funds generated from the express lanes will be used to defray the costs of construction, operations, and maintenance of the lanes. Long-term revenue allocation is being studied and a decision about future excess revenues will be made later in the project process. Proponents for the express lanes say it is to provide commuters with a more reliable, free-flow commute option; complement the state's multimodal approach to managing traffic demand; and establish the vision for a future system of HOT lanes in the region. Detractors point out that existing infrastructure was reused for the express lanes and that commute times on the nonpaying travel lanes have doubled since implementation. History\nOriginally constructed as a four- to six-lane expressway in the 1950s, the stretch of I-85 between the southern merge with I-75 and North Druid Hills Road was reconstructed as part of the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT)'s Freeing the Freeways program.

The 30-mile (48 km) section between LaGrange and Newnan was incomplete for a much-longer time that the rest of I-85 in Georgia and required a two-lane detour on US 27 and US 29 between those cities. The northern section between Newnan and Grantville was completed first, then the stretch further south to LaGrange was completed in 1977. The portion of the highway from the Buford Highway Connector to SR 400 was constructed during the early 1980s and was designed as a replacement for the original four-lane routing of I-85 (now SR 13). In addition, the new viaduct was designed to accommodate connections to the SR 400 tollway (then in planning), HOV lanes, and a bridge carrying the North Line (then under construction, now the Red Line). Until 2000, the state of Georgia used the sequential exit numbering system on all of its Interstate Highways.

From Atlanta, I-85 north was originally slated to be built through the city of Athens to provide an easy link between the capital city and the University of Georgia. However, then-Governor Ernest Vandiver worked to make sure the highway traversed his home county of Franklin, a stretch that now bears his name. At the time, he promised equivalent access for Athens and Gainesville. It was not until the completion of SR 316 in the 1990s that there was finally a relatively quick, multilane expressway connecting Athens and Atlanta, (US 78 is also multilane between Athens and Atlanta but it is not expressway-grade) although SR 316 still is largely at-grade.

    "text": "Manuela Zoccali is an Italian astronomer who works in Chile as a professor of astrophysics at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile in Santiago, and is the former director of the Millennium Institute of Astrophysics at the university. Her research concerns the metallicity of stars, particularly those in the galactic bulge of the Milky Way, and the implications of these observations for the evolution of both individual stars and the formation of the bulge. Her research has suggested the independent formation of stars in the bulge, rather than migration of stars from the galactic disk to its bulge. Education and career\nZoccali is originally from Reggio Calabria in southern Italy. She was a student of astronomy at the University of Padua, where she earned a laurea in 1995, with undergraduate research on globular cluster NGC 1261, and completed her Ph.D. in 2000. Her doctoral dissertation concerned low-mass stars, and was supervised by Giampaolo Piotto. She became a postdoctoral researcher at the European Southern Observatory from 2000 to 2003, during which she first visited Chile to help set up spectroscopy instrumentation at the Paranal Observatory. Next, she won a joint fellowship of Princeton University and the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, funding her for a continued year of postdoctoral research through both universities.",

Background\nFollowing the victory at the battle of Mansomine, Geraldes and his allies faced a risky situation. Despite the lack of reinforcements from the colonial governor, Gomes Barbosa, who refused to give support, Geraldes decided to press on. The region was tense, with the Umbucu rallying 800 auxiliaries to join 40 soldiers under Alferes Amaral Carvalho Vieira and 70 grumetes, forming a column of 910 men. Musa Molo was accidentally wounded, so his chiefs led his force, he anticipated the expedition and fortified a stronghold at Buaró, deep within the territory of Mansomine. The location was strategically chosen, and all régulos from the region coordinated their forces to repel the Portuguese column, there vigilant enemy scouts patrolled the terrain. Battle\nAfter setting camp at Cheuvel, Geraldes carefully planned his advance, avoiding paths prone to ambush. Guided by locals familiar with the terrain, the column approached Buaró undetected until they emerged from the jungle onto the plain where the fortified tabanca stood.",

    "text": "Guided by locals familiar with the terrain, the column approached Buaró undetected until they emerged from the jungle onto the plain where the fortified tabanca stood. The battle began with a fierce exchange of fire as the Portuguese forces positioned their artillery on the column's left flank. An attempt to reposition the artillery closer to the enemy resulted in it being abandoned under heavy fire, with 5 grumetes severely wounded. Seizing the moment, the enemy cavalry launched an attack, forcing Geraldes to dispatch reinforcements to stabilize the line. Returning to the abandoned artillery, Geraldes and 4 soldiers managed to recover and reposition the piece. A well aimed shot from the artillery broke through the enemy defenses, killing six defenders. The remaining forces either fled or were cut down in close combat. After four hours of intense fighting, the tabanca fell. Aftermath\nThe victory allowed Geraldes's forces to conduct a series of raids in the surrounding territory, destroying four tabancas over the next three days. The forces of Pata Jedé and Sambel Nhantá did not dare to offer resistance after the defeat at Buaró. References\nPélissier, René (1997).

Serving as a successor to a pair of Facebook-oriented devices HTC released in 2011, it was the first and only Android device to be pre-loaded with Facebook's own user interface layer, Facebook Home, in lieu of HTC's own Sense. While considered compelling by critics for a mid-range phone due to its display quality and its optional use of stock Android beneath the default Facebook Home overlay, the HTC First was panned by critics for its poor camera and lack of removable storage, and was also affected by the similarly underwhelming reception faced by the Facebook Home software. AT T, the exclusive U.S. carrier of the First, only reportedly sold over 15,000 units of the device, while both ReadWrite and Time named it among the biggest failures in the technology industry for 2013. Development\nIn 2011, HTC released two low-end smartphones that provided integration with the social networking service Facebook, the keyboard-equipped HTC Status, and the larger slate HTC Salsa. The two phones featured Facebook's apps pre-loaded, along with Facebook integration within the HTC Sense interface and a dedicated Facebook key that could be used to provide quick access to sharing functions.",

Later that year, details began surfacing about a collaboration between Facebook and HTC known as  Buffy  (after the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer), a fork of Android that would be  deeply social . The specifications of the phone was first leaked out by an HTC insider towards the end of 2012 that had claimed the device was then called  Opera UL  with a 1280x720 screen, and an Adreno 305 graphics processor with the Snapdragon 1.4 GHz CPU system on chip, which was later known to match the actual specifications of the final device. In early 2013, reports indicated that HTC was preparing to unveil a Facebook-oriented smartphone with the revised codename  Myst ; this mid-range device was reportedly pre-loaded with a new Facebook-developed user interface layer known as  Facebook Home . Renderings of the new device leaked on April 3, 2013, revealing the design of the phone and its official name as the HTC First.

AT T exclusively released the device in the United States on April 12, 2013. Specifications\nHardware\nThe HTC First is a mid-range smartphone which uses a dual-core, 1.4 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor with support for LTE, a 2000 mAh battery, 1 GB of RAM and 16 GB of non-expandable storage. The First uses a 4.3-inch 720p Super LCD display, and includes a 5-megapixel rear-facing camera, and a 1.6-megapixel front-facing camera. The HTC First's exterior uses a rounded, minimal design with three capacitive buttons below its screen, and was available in black, light blue, red, and white color finishes. Software\nThe HTC First runs Android 4.1.2  Jelly Bean  and Facebook Home, a new interface layer developed by Facebook that heavily integrates with the service. Facebook Home consists of a home screen and lock screen replacement known as Cover Feed (which aggregates content posted by friends on Facebook along with notifications from other apps), the ability to message users (via either Facebook or SMS) from any app using the  Chat Heads  overlay, and an overall experience that is oriented towards social interaction. The HTC First was also the first smartphone to include the recently acquired Instagram as a pre-loaded app.",

If Facebook Home is disabled, the device reverts to a stock Android 4.1 experience; the First was the first HTC device since the T-Mobile G2 to offer a stock Android interface and not ship with the company's HTC Sense software. Reception\nThe HTC First was released to mixed reviews. Dieter Bohn of The Verge gave the HTC First a 7.9 out of 10, receiving high marks in most categories except for its camera. Its design was considered to have a comfortable size and shape by contrast to larger flagship Android phones, and a display that was noted for its high resolution, good color reproduction and  ridiculous  viewing angles (but still being hard to use in direct sunlight). The First's camera was considered to be better than expected for a low-end phone, but produced  muddy  photos and   felt  like a throwback to an earlier age when smartphones were nigh-useless in the dark.",

Alex Roth of TechRadar gave the HTC First a 3.5 out of 5, praising its build quality and operating system (feeling that the First could  develop a sort of second life as the mid-range of choice among Google geeks  due to its use of stock Android and LTE support) and considering it to possibly be  the last decent dual-core handset ever made , but considered Facebook Home to be a  glorified screensaver , and also criticized the camera's low quality and the lack of a dedicated shutter button (which Roth believed would have made sense on a Facebook-oriented phone).

In December 2013, Time named the HTC First as one of the 47  lamest moments in tech  for 2013, and ReadWrite similarly named it one of the  Top 10 Tech Failures  of 2013, stating that  like Carrie Underwood in the remade Sound of Music Live!, the HTC First smartphone started out as an intriguing concept that attempted to shoehorn something very popular (Facebook) into a familiar vehicle (a smartphone).

On 18 April 1388 Cardinal Anglico Grimoard, Suburbicarian Bishop of Albano, died, and he was succeeded (c. 1390, according to Eubel) by Cardinal Brancaccio. Trouble with Benedict XIII\nOn 1 September 1398 at Villeneuve eighteen cardinals, among them Niccolò Brancaccio, published the retraction of their obedience to Benedict XIII. A few weeks later, after negotiations with the pontiff, they returned to their obedience. On 29 June 1408, thirteen cardinals (who held the proxies of two additional cardinals) met in the port city of Livorno in Italy, where they prepared a manifesto, in which they pledged themselves to summon a general council of the Church to solve the problem of the Great Western Schism. One of them was Niccolò Brancaccio, Cardinal Bishop of Albano.",

When the vote was called for on 10 May 1409 in the matter of deposing and anathematizing Benedict XIII and Gregory XII, the vote was nearly unanimous, except for Cardinal Guy de Malsec and Cardinal Niccolò Brancaccio, who asked for more time to consider. The sentence was finally read on 5 June. Conclaves\nBrancaccio was one of the twenty-four cardinals who took part in the Conclave that was held during the Council, from 15 June to 26 June 1409. Cardinal Pietro Filargo was elected, and chose the name Alexander V. Unfortunately he survived only 10½ months, but during that time, in a gesture intended to heal the wounds of the schism, he issued a papal decree legitimizing all of the cardinals of all the obediences. The Conclave to elect his successor took place in Bologna from 15 to 17 May 1410, and again Niccolò Brancaccio was one of the seventeen cardinals who participated.

He is best known for his 1991 to 1996 run as penciler on Fantastic Four, which represents his longest association with an individual comic book series. From 2005 until his death in 2016, Ryan penciled and inked the daily newspaper comic strip The Phantom for King Features Syndicate. Biography\nEarly years\nPaul Ryan was born in Somerville, Massachusetts, in 1949. He attended St. Polycarp Grammar School in Somerville, and graduated from St. Mary of the Annunciation High School in 1967. He graduated from the Massachusetts College of Art in 1971 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree in Graphic Design. After graduation Ryan enlisted in the United States National Guard and was assigned to Fort Dix, New Jersey, for Basic Training and AIT (Advanced Individual Training) in automotive mechanics. He later attended Massachusetts Military Academy in Wakefield, Massachusetts, for officer training. Ryan was a member of his National Guard pistol team, studied karate and fencing in his younger days, and at one time took up archery and weight training. As a young man, Ryan found a job in the Graphics Department of Metcalf   Eddy Engineering in Boston, where he worked for 11 years.",

First steps in comics\nAccording to a 2007 interview,  Ryan began his training  for a career in comic art  as a child, growing up in Somerville. He'd park himself in front of the television each night to watch George Reeves in the Adventures of Superman. Ryan began drawing one-page comic stories in grade school, inspired by his love of comics to create his own. He has said that as a youngster in the Silver Age, he was influenced by the work of Wayne Boring and Curt Swan on Superman. In 1961, Ryan became a big fan of the Fantastic Four of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, having  bought the first issue at the tender age of 11. He has acknowledged that even as a youth he studied the work of Hal Foster, Sy Barry, Dan Barry, and Mac Raboy, adding  I'm pretty much influenced by anybody whose work I admire. In 1983, in response to a general  open audition  offer from Charlton Comics, Ryan was finally prompted to write and draw his first full-scale comics story, which he titled  BREED . Charlton had recently instituted a program whereby they would publish the best of the work submitted by aspiring comic book artists in Charlton Bullseye.",

Payment would be in the form of 50 contributor copies of the printed piece. The artist would then have published work to show Marvel Comics or DC Comics in the hopes of landing a job with the  Big Two. Charlton accepted Ryan's story, encouraging him that a career in comics was within reach, but the title was cancelled before  BREED  saw print. The remaining stories from Bullseye ended up in the hands of Bill Black of Americomics in Florida, and Black published  BREED  in Starmasters  1 (March 1984). This brought Ryan to the attention of comic book stores in the Boston area. When Marvel artist Bob Layton moved to Boston and needed an assistant, the employees at these stores recommended Paul Ryan to Layton. Ryan worked for Layton for a year doing his backgrounds, and through him met the editors and staff at Marvel. Layton is said to have played a vital role in Ryan's development. Ryan said that his only formal training in comics came in that 1983-1984 span, working as Bob Layton's assistant while also preparing his penciling samples for Marvel. By this time Ryan, having taken a circuitous route toward a career in comic art, was in his middle 30s.",

At Marvel Comics\nSoon, Ryan was getting assignments of his own, starting with inking The Thing  27 (September 1985) and then moving on to penciling Iron Man  202, Squadron Supreme, The Eternals, and a Thor graphic novel. In 1986, writer Mark Gruenwald and Ryan co-created D.P. 7 for Marvel's New Universe imprint. The series featured a then-uncommonly realistic view of what consequences could arise from having paranormal abilities. D.P. 7 has been called  a clear forerunner   both in tone and content   of the television series Heroes. Ryan said that his favorite creative moment in comics was sitting down with Gruenwald and coming up with the look for D.P. 7:  At Mark s direction we 'cast' our characters based on real people. This is something that I still do when confronted with new characters. When given a description of a character by the writer I look through various magazines for just the right look. Rich Johnston of Bleeding Cool proclaimed D.P. 7  a wonderful comic book, everything just seemed to gel together perfectly on that series, and on Quasar that followed it, and I was hooked.

Excited, but knowing the historic and financial significance of this story for Marvel Comics, I couldn t help but be a little nervous. Considering that I had only been in the business a minute and a half I should never have been given that assignment. Jim Shooter really took a chance with me. He asked. I accepted. He handed me the plot. I hope I didn t disappoint him. Ryan penciled the first six issues of Quasar in 1989 90, and also worked on a significant run of The Avengers. Recalling Ryan's work on the latter title, writer Jason Versaggi said that Ryan's  draft work seemed to seamlessly transition from the end of John Buscema's stints on those books in the '90s.

Of all his work for Marvel, Paul Ryan is most strongly associated with the Fantastic Four for his long run on their flagship title. Ryan said that when he was first offered the art assignment he actually declined, because he was reluctant to give up the Avengers to clear time in his schedule.

He was a contributing artist on the NASCAR Superman custom comic and on Celebrating the Century, a stamp collecting book which DC produced for the United States Postal Service. Ryan briefly returned to Marvel in 1999, teaming again with writer Tom DeFalco, this time on the Fantastic Five. The turn of the Millennium found Ryan working with Wildstorm, penciling one of the Left Behind graphic novels, and working with Crossgen as a fill-in artist on such titles as Ruse and Crux. Crossgen's recruitment of Ryan and other notable talent led DC Comics to consider that upstart publisher a significant threat in the comic book market.

Ryan told him he was interested, and was given the appropriate contact information. Soon, the publisher had samples from Ryan, and he quickly signed him on to Team Fantomen. Ryan became a regular contributor of covers and finished interior art to Fantomen for the next five years, a job which would position him well for his next major assignment. The Phantom comic strip\nThe Phantom comic strip began as a weekday newspaper strip on February 17, 1936, with a color Sunday strip added in May 1939. It was originally written by creator Lee Falk, and when Falk died in 1999, Tony DePaul took over the writing duties. Paul Ryan was one of the several artists who have illustrated the character's comic strip adventures over the decades. In 2005 then-current artist George Olesen announced his retirement. Jay Kennedy, editor-in-chief at King Features Syndicate, chose Ryan to assume the artist's role on the daily strips, beginning with those published in January of that year (Ryan had been the artist on King's Amazing Spider-Man strip a decade earlier).",

(In May of 2021, DePaul and Manley began an adventure called To Wrack and Ruin at Gravelines, which was the first part of a much larger story that subsequently surpassed  The Death of Diana Palmer Walker  in length.)\nDePaul credits Ryan with pitching the basis of another memorable story,  The Challenge , by posing the question,  What if someone challenged Guran for the right to be chief of the Bandar? The story DePaul developed from that prompt ended with Guran still chief, but acknowledging the worthiness of his challenger, Kipawa, as a possible successor one day. Rich Johnston praised Ryan for his artwork on The Phantom:  Here it seems he has come into his own, a richer and more luxurious style that is less tempered by the effects of Marvel or DC editorial with a greater influence from Europe. Ryan's last Phantom strip was released on Saturday, May 28, 2016. Working methods\nSpeaking about his work as a comic book penciler, Ryan described his process:  I read the stories and 'see' what it should look like in my mind, do a thumbnail sketch of the picture in my head and then go to full size drawing paper.",

    "text": "Although known primarily for his pencil art for comic books, Ryan said that he preferred to ink his own pencils:  I have worked with some amazing inkers. Some inkers made my work look better than it was. Some other inkers... not so much. When I ink my pencils, the readers get to see what I can do. On The Phantom, Ryan penciled and inked. When asked how long it takes to produce his daily comic strip, Ryan estimated  four hours to pencil a strip and three hours to ink it in, crafting lighting and shadows. Ryan began with penciling only the line work. I work out the lighting, shadows and texture in the inking stage. I go in with the brush first and hit all the shadows and large dark areas. This helps define the page. Then I go in with a finer brush or pen to add details, texture or contour lines. Ryan's art was characterized by a strong story-telling sense, careful attention to design and perspective, and solid knowledge of anatomy on a strip that he at one time drew for publication 365 days a year. While Ryan kept reference books handy, he gave more credit to observation and an artist's eye for his knowledge of human anatomy as well as the structure of the world around us. Whenever I'm in any situation, I'll constantly try to memorize things. I'll memorize a face, a room, and actually mentally outline everything. He also took particular notice of shadows.",

Drawings of the real people in his life, such as family and friends, appeared in his comics. He said that his eye was especially drawn to the character expressed in older faces. You see so much history in the face. And that's something I try to bring into the work. Ryan confessed to having run around his neighborhood as a youngster with a makeshift Superman cape tied around his neck ( I got beat up a lot , he joked), and his emotional identification with comic characters continued into his professional years:  I find that while I'm illustrating a story I become so focused that I feel as if I'm  actually  in the story, taking the part of each of the characters as I draw them,  Ryan said. Legacy, personal and professional\nRyan continued as the artist for The Phantom daily comic strips until his death at the age of 66. He died unexpectedly on March 7, 2016, at his home in Hudson, Massachusetts. Tony DePaul, the writer of The Phantom, collaborated with Ryan on the strip for twelve years.

Which may be why,  DePaul suggested,  he was so good at drawing Hero, the Phantom s trusty mount. DePaul posted photos of Ryan and his wife Linda Ryan enjoying a recent vacation at a ranch in Sweet Grass County, Montana. DePaul made reference in a 2017 interview to the  magnificent work Paul did for so many years, and for way less money than he was worth ; citing an example of Ryan's best work, DePaul said  Paul s art was especially well done in the 'Voyaging Canoe', night scenes at sea, in the fog, that can t be easy to pull off.",

He listened to everyone who wanted to talk to him, he kindly signed all the stuff that was thrown at him and he was incredibly generous and honest in the tales he told about working on The Phantom. The highlight for me was watching Paul create some Phantom artwork live. It was amazing and something I ll never forget. Writer Larry Hama, Ryan's friend and collaborator at both Marvel and DC Comics, praised him as  an impeccable draftsman, a solid visual storyteller, and really, really nice guy. Hama continued,  I always knew that a plot I sent him would be drawn with a keen attention to detail, aspects of the story would be improved upon, and my mistakes would be corrected. Mark Evanier reminisced:  Some years ago, Paul and I were going to collaborate on a new comic book based on a leftover idea of Jack Kirby's.

What a shame to lose a good man like that. That's Entertainment manager Ken Carson noted the many store events at which Ryan had appeared over the span of twenty years, and reflected on his personality and wit:  He was a meticulous craftsman, but Paul enjoyed friendly banter as he sketched   signed for fans and he had a mischievous sense of humor! He could say outlandish things with a straight face, but a sparkle in his eye would give him away. Brendan Burford (King Features general manager, syndication) eulogized the artist:  Paul had an illustrious career in comics that spanned decades, and we at King Features are so pleased that he was able to ply his craft to our beloved PHANTOM.

His passion in life was his wife, Linda, and the treasured times they shared throughout their 28 years together in marriage. In the weeks after Ryan's death, Frew Publications declared The Phantom issue number 1748 to be a  Paul Ryan Tribute  issue. This issue was Frew's first comic book to have the interior printed in color. In addition to a full-length adventure drawn by Ryan, the issue contained photographs from his 2014 visit to Australia and several remembrances. Publisher Dudley Hogarth therein attributed the following quote to Ryan:  My heroes have always been men of action. Some of them wore a mask. Some rode a horse. Some had an animal companion. A few carried a gun. Fewer still operated from a secret cave. One hero, in particular, combined all of these elements and more. He was the Phantom!

History\nThe original lineup formed from remnants of short-lived  punkadelic  band Black Juju, and consisted of guitarist vocalist songwriter Jerry Wick, bassist Eric Barth (who had also been in Two Hour Trip with the Spurgeon brothers, who would soon form Greenhorn), and drummer Jeff Regensburger (later of The Patsys). Jim Weber (also of the then newly formed New Bomb Turks) soon joined on second guitar only to leave just as quickly, and following his departure guitarist songwriter Jovan Karcic (Waybald) joined. Barth and Regensburger would also later leave (in 1995) and be replaced by a series of successors including Bret Lewis and Brett Falcon (Space Cookie, Servotron) on bass, and Nick Youngblood (Beano, The Rackets) and Sam Brown (Feversmile, V-3, New Bomb Turks, The Sun, You're So Bossy) on drums. In 1994, the quartet was signed to the independent Thrill Jockey and Crypt Records labels and their debut album, Sob Story, was produced by Steve Albini.

The band had gained a loyal local following in the Columbus area, alongside other indie punk rock bands, such as the New Bomb Turks, Thomas Jefferson Slave Apartments, Monster Truck Five, and Pica Huss. In 1995, Gaunt released a third album, Yeah, Me Too. The album was released by Amphetamine Reptile Records (the label had originally approached them to record a track for their Dope, Guns, and Fucking in the Streets singles series, which they did earlier in the year), produced by Tim Mac (Halo of Flies) - who would remain with the band for the rest of their career as live sound and pre-production engineer - and was recorded over the course of a few days. One last album was recorded for Thrill Jockey, entitled Kryptonite, and released in 1996. Kryptonite was released with a metallic lime green cover and contained lyrics about Superman, Lois Lane, and lost love. Over the course of the next year, the band began to drift apart, with Wick recording solo material under the name Cocaine Sniffing Triumph. On August 20, 1997, the band signed to major label Warner Bros. Records, and they soon came together again.

The area, which is part of the city green belt, contains lakes, meadows and oak groves. It was drained in the 19th century to transform the area into farmland. Restoration work started in 1994 and has reversed this situation and now Salburua is a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance. The Salburua marshes are considered to be  the Basque country's most valuable area of wetland , according to a Fedenatur report for the European Commission in 2004. History\nBefore 1857, the Salburua wetlands had at least three lakes: Betoño, Larregana, and Arcaute. The grazing, hunting and fishing were well known throughout Basque Country. Around Arcaute lake was an oak forest landscape characteristic of the Plains of Alava. In 1857, a process of draining the lakes and forest clearance was initiated with the aim of producing valuable agricultural land. This process continued into the 20th century when the last lake, Betoño, was drained. Work began in 1994 on the recovery of the ancient landscape.",

At that time there was only a remnant of forest, north of Elorriaga, and a small wet patch near Betoño, in which the last animals and plants characteristic of these environments barely survived. Negative impacts on the area were included poaching, slums, and waste disposal. Ecological restoration work began with the reversal of the drainage of Lake Betoño. In 1998 a dam was built in the Canal de la Balsa to help this process. Through these activities it has been possible to recover an area of more than 180 hectares (440 acres), of which, at times of maximum flooding, 60 hectares (150 acres) are covered by water. The restoration of Salburua serves as protection against flooding in the city of Vitoria-Gasteiz, which uses the lagoons and ponds. Since 1994 restoration work and landscaping in the vicinity of the lakes, and along water courses, have helped to recover some of the original wealth of Salburua.

Small mammals include the European mink which is an endangered species. There is also a wide variety of amphibians. At present the greatest threat to these species is the arrival of invasive species. Large numbers of birds use the wetlands for breeding or wintering. The INBIOS Project aims to\nimprove populations of threatened species: bats, sand martins, waders, herons and otters; improve the conservation status of habitats, especially aquatic vegetation and the edges of ponds; combating invasive alien species of fauna, fish and American freshwater crayfish. Another objective is to conduct the first pilot project of reintroduction of European mink in the river ecosystems of northern Spain. Flora\nAlthough the most spectacular sight are the animals, Salburua also hosts a variety of vegetation, especially wetland species. Many of these species have managed to revive after the revitalization of wetlands.",

    "text": "The staðamál ('church-estate conflict') was a conflict between the bishops and secular aristocrats of Iceland over the control of proprietary churches which the arisocrats had established on their own estates and viewed as their own property (thus receiving part of the tithes pertaining to them). The staðamál proceeded in two waves. First, the year after Þorlákur helgi Þórhallsson became bishop of Skálholt in 1178, he began to demand control over ecclesiastical estates, following the reforms of Archbishop Eysteinn Erlendsson of Niðarós. This staðamál concluded with Þorlákur seizing control over a number of ecclesiastical estates, but otherwise little changed except that it became clear to aristocrats that the Church did not view their control of proprietary churches as legal. The later staðamál began when Bishop Árni Þorláksson of Skálholt (who earned himself the nickname  Staða-Árni ) undertook a further reorganisation of the local church, known as Kristnirétt Árna, in 1275. This concluded with a special settlement between Árni and Iceland's secular aristocrats in Ögvaldsnes in Norway in 1297, under the leadership of Jörundur Þorsteinsson and King Eiríkur Magnússon.",

Why not Macedonia for Macedonians as well as Bulgaria for Bulgarians and Servia for Servians. He also forecasted that, if Macedonians do not stand together in the face of the territorial aspirations, they would certainly be devoured by the existing states. Gladstone appealed for the right of self-determination of the peoples who resided in the region, while Britain proceeded in the following period contemplating the creation of an autonomous Macedonia with a Christian governor as a possible solution of the Macedonian question. On that occasion, the British journalist G. W. Steevens also noted in the preface of the brochure containing the letter of Gladstone, that he has used  Macedonians  as a collective name of the diverse population of the region. Steevens explained that there were at least six different kind of Macedonians at that time. Once Gladstone launched the motto, this maxim became widely known. In 1898, the historian William Miller, who visited Macedonia during that period, stressed that it was overrun by rivaling national propagandas, especially Bulgarian, Serb, and Greek who saw Macedonia as their promised land.",

In fact a few accepted then the idea that there might be a separate Macedonian nation.

In an article published in June 1902, the IMARO revolutionaries promoted the idea of autonomy and the slogans  Macedonia for the Macedonians . The Organization gave a guarantee for the preservation of all national communities there, and insisted that the Bulgarians could be proud of their tolerance, in opposition to Romanians, Serbs and Greeks. They also planned that the administration of the future autonomous Macedonia will rely on the Bulgarian majority. Those revolutionaries saw the future autonomous Macedonia as a multinational polity, and  Macedonian  was an umbrella term covering Greeks, Bulgarians, Turks, Aromanians and Megleno-Romanians, Albanians, Serbs, etc. However, there was no clear concept about the ultimate outcome of the autonomy, some of the members, especially those with leftist inclination, saw it as independent Macedonia, while others saw it as step for the incorporation of Macedonia into the Bulgarian state. The British Consul in Skopje Raphael Fontana wrote on the occasion of the Ilinden Uprising in 1903 that the revolutionaries were working for a general Bulgarian uprising in order to reach their goal of  Macedonia for the Macedonians , understood to mean  Macedonia for the Bulgarians .",

In 1905 the Serres group of Yane Sandanski accused the Supreme Macedonian-Adrianople Committee activists that under the motto  Macedonia for the Macedonians  they put a disguised motto  Macedonia for Bulgaria . The idea of autonomous Macedonia was understood by the Organization as an independent state, which will enter as a separate member into the Balkan Federation. During the 1920s the descendant of the IMARO - IMRO followed also the idea about an independent united Macedonian multiethnic state with prevailing Bulgarian element, something as  Switzerland on the Balkans  and kept the slogan Macedonia for the Macedonians until it became defunct in 1934.

    "text": "Megacerops ( large-horned face ) is an extinct genus of brontothere, an extinct group of rhinoceros-like browsers traditionally classified as relatives of horses. Megacerops was endemic to North America during the Late Eocene, during the Chadronian land mammal age. Chadronian brontotheres are well represented in the fossil record, known from several skeletons and hundreds of complete skulls. Because the fossils vary considerably in the size and shape of the horns, close to fifty species of Chadronian brontotheres have been named historically. Poor stratigraphic data for the majority of the fossils has further complicated the taxonomy. Today, variations among the fossils are considered to be the result of sexual dimorphism and other individual variation. Only one Chadronian brontothere species is confidently considered to be valid, M. coloradensis. Rare fossils with bifurcating horns may represent a second species, M. kuwagatarhinus. Several historical generic names now considered synonyms of Megacerops remain common in popular culture, such as Brontotherium, Brontops, and Titanotherium. Although similar to modern rhinoceros, Megacerops was closer to elephants in size. The largest known Megacerops may have been over 2.5 meters (8.2 feet) tall at the shoulder and could have weighed up to five tonnes.",

They were the largest animals in their environment and likely too large to be preyed upon by any contemporary predator. The horns of Megacerops, its signature feature, were anatomically similar to the ossicones of modern giraffes and are believed to have been used in intraspecific combat. Paleoclimatological models of the Eocene, and isotope analyses of Megacerops teeth, suggest that they lived in warm temperate to subtropical forests and woodlands, and preferred moist environments. History of research\nEarly discoveries\nFossils of Megacerops were among the first mammal fossils from the American West to be brought to scientific attention. Long before the time of scientific inquiry into the fossils, Megacerops remains were sometimes exposed by severe rainstorms and found by Native Americans of the Lakota Sioux and Pawnee peoples. The Lakota referred to these great mammals as wakíŋyaŋ, translated as  thunder beasts . The first brontothere fossil to be scientifically described was a fragment of a right jaw (USNM 21820), found in Chadronian deposits in the White River badlands of South Dakota. The jaw fragment was described by Hiram A. Prout in 1846 and 1847.",

Although Prout correctly identified the fossil as belonging to a large perissodactyl, he believed that the jaw came from a  giant Palaeotherium  (an equoid). In 1849, Auguste Pomel realized that the fossil did not belong to Palaeotherium and instead designated it as the type specimen of a new genus and species, Menodus giganteus. In 1850, Richard Owen and colleagues recorded further brontothere teeth and jaws. Owen and colleagues believed these fossils represented the same species as Prout's jaw but noted that it was difficult to establish diagnostic features on the genus level. Apparently ignoring Pomel's name, Owen and colleagues named the new species Palaeotherium? proutii.Owen's fossils were soon acquired by Joseph Leidy, who examined and described the material in greater detail through 1852 and 1853. Already before any in-depth study, Leidy suspected that the fossils did not belong to any known equoid, such as Palaeotherium or Anchitherium, and noted that  should the suspicion prove correct, Titanotherium would be a good name for this animal, as expressive of its very great size .

Although recognized as large perissodactyls, early descriptions of brontothere fossils up to and including Leidy's work failed to recognize their distinctive nature. The first known brontothere fossil to preserve most of the animal's distinctive horns was described by Leidy in 1870 as the type specimen of the new genus and species Megacerops coloradensis. Leidy obtained the fragmentary fossil from  Dr. Gehrung of Colorado City  and, lacking comparative brontothere material, incorrectly believed it to have belonged to a relative of the extinct giraffid Sivatherium. In the 1870s and 1880s, the northern Great Plains were one of the main regions to be extensively excavated in the Bone Wars, a period of intense competitive fossil hunting between the rival researchers Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope. Both Marsh and Cope funded expeditions to uncover and describe new prehistoric mammals in the region. In the 1870s, Marsh and Cope described several dinoceratans, an extinct group of large mammals, some of which had horns similar to Megacerops, such as Uintatherium and Eobasileus.",

In 1873, Leidy speculated that his Megacerops may belong to the same order as these animals, and not the ruminants. Leidy further noted similarities between the Megacerops specimen and fragmentary fossil horn cores he had previously speculated to perhaps belong to Titanotherium. Further discoveries\nOthniel Charles Marsh is considered the most important figure in the early research on the brontotheres. His studies of brontotheres began in 1870, when Marsh led an expedition to northern Colorado on behalf of Yale College. During the expedition, Marsh's crew were shown a brontothere jaw by a group of Lakota, who told them of their legends of wakíŋyaŋ. The expedition collected a large number of brontothere fossils, including jaws, skulls, and postcranial elements. In honor of Lakota legends, Marsh named the new genus Brontotherium ( thunder beast ) in 1873. Marsh's 1873 description of Brontotherium gigas was the most important contribution to brontothere knowledge up until his time.",

The holotype was designated as another lower jaw, but Marsh was able to correctly describe several characters of both the jaws and the rest of the skeleton. Marsh recognized Brontotherium as a  true perissodactyl with limb bones resembling those of Rhinoceros . Marsh recognized that Brontotherium was related to the animal described as Titanotherium by Leidy, and erected the new family Brontotheriidae to contain the two genera. In 1875, H. C. Clifford discovered and excavated a large and relatively complete brontothere skeleton near Chadron, Nebraska. This skeleton (YPM VP 12048) was described by Marsh in 1887 as the type specimen of the new genus and species Brontops robustus. Marsh continued to study brontothere fossils for the reminder of his career, some collected by himself but most purchased from collectors  out West . New specimens were also uncovered and studied by Leidy and Cope. Marsh, Leidy, and Cope named new species for close to every Chadronian brontothere specimen that came into their possession.

Paleontological field work was carried out at an unprecedented scale by the US Geological Survey to gather material for Marsh's monographs on ceratopsian dinosaurs and brontotheres. The brontothere collection assembled for Marsh's monograph eventually included several nearly complete skeletons and nearly two hundred complete skulls. Marsh's brontothere monograph was not completed before his death in 1899, and he left no known manuscript for it, only pencil notes and unpublished figures. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, most of the museums in the United States funded fossil collecting in the so-called  Titanotherium beds  of the Great Plains, increasing the already large brontothere fossil sample to encompass further skeletons and hundreds of skulls. In 1929, Henry Fairfield Osborn published a monograph on the brontotheres, The Titanotheres of Ancient Wyoming, Dakota and Nebraska. Osborn had made study of brontotheres one of his life's quests and believed his work, spanning 951 pages and two volumes, and illustrated with 795 figures and 236 plates, would be the definitive work on the animals.

Most Megacerops specimens have poorly recorded stratigraphic data, limiting the degree to which variation in single contemporary populations can be studied. The American Museum of Natural History has a large collection of brontothere specimens with well-recorded stratigraphic data, collected in the 1940s and 1950s.

Marsh incorrectly argued in 1873 that Menodus was preoccupied by the reptile Menodon ( Nothosaurus). In several publications, both Leidy and Osborn sometimes confused USNM 113 (type specimen of Titanotherium) with USNM 21820 (type specimen of Menodus). Osborn incorrectly believed that USNM 21820 had been destroyed in the St. Louis Fire of 1849 and proposed designating a brontothere skull in the American Museum of Natural History, AMNH 505, as a neotype specimen. Chadronian brontotheres are very similar in most features of the skeleton. Clear differences between specimens are for the most part seen only in the shape, orientation, and size of horns, nasal bones, and zygomatic arches. Before his 1929 monograph, Osborn considered the possibility that all Chadronian brontotheres belonged to a single genus, for which he preferred the name Titanotherium.

Osborn's conclusions faced criticism by other paleontologists. In 1941, William Berryman Scott stated that  it is hardly worthwhile even to list the species; that 37 species could not have co-existed within the relatively brief space of the Chadron, is obvious; how many did exist and what names should be given to them, are insoluable problems . Scott further stated that  the probably great effects of sex and age and fluctuating variability have not been sufficiently evaluated . Despite criticism, further revisions of brontothere material were not attempted for most of the 20th century due to the daunting size of Osborn's monograph and the sheer number of fossil specimens known, many of which were yet to be sufficiently prepared.

Finding it unlikely that these associated fossils were from four separate species, Clark, Beerbower, and Kietzke referred all four to Menodus giganteus, the oldest available Chadronian brontothere name, and designated all other generic names, such as Brontotherium and Titanotherium, as junior synonyms.

Recognition of only two species\nIn a 2004 preliminary revision, Matthew C. Mihlbachler, Spencer G. Lucas, and Robert J. Emry concluded that while the variation among Chadronian brontotheres was greater than what is generally accepted within a single species, the variability resembles that of modern sexually dimorphic mammal species. Mihlbachler, Lucas, and Emry noted that if only a single Chadronian brontothere species is recognized, the name Menodus giganteus should be used as the oldest available name. The problem was complicated by rare Chadronian brontothere skulls with bifurcating horns, a trait not seen in the vast majority of specimens. These fossils had been described as a new species by Mader and John P. Alexander in 1995, Megacerops kuwagatarhinus.

Further studies by Mihlbachler in 2004 and 2008 further supported that only two Chadronian brontothere species, M. coloradensis and M. kuwagatarhinus were diagnosable, with all other species either being synonyms of those two species or nomina dubia.

Megacerops had the most developed horns out of all of the North American brontotheres, consisting of two bony protuberances above the nose, vaguely reminiscent of a slingshot in shape. In Megacerops, the horns had evolved to become the dominant and central feature of the skull. The shape, size, and orientation of Megacerops horns varied greatly between individuals, as did the degree to which the horns impacted the rest of the skull anatomy.

It is possible that the system controlling horn growth as Megacerops matured was relatively indeterminate, with minor genetic differences or  accidents of developments  giving rise to great variations in shape. Based on sexual dimorphism in modern horned mammals, larger Megacerops with larger horns are assumed to have been males. The horns were composed of non-deciduous bone and not elaborated with any additional structures. There were large air cavities in the base of the horns. Among modern mammals, the anatomical structure that most closely resembles brontothere horns are the ossicones of giraffes. The life appearance of the horns is unknown. They have been described as analogous to the horns of deer and bovines and historical reconstructions have often depicted them as sheathed in keratinous horns. It is unlikely that the horns were sheathed in such a way in life, since they lack the vascular impressions seen in horn cores of animals such as cows and ceratopsian dinosaurs.

The roughened surface is similar to the roughened patches beneath horns on rhinoceros skulls. In 1905, Richard Swann Lull speculated that the roughened surfaces on brontothere horns could have supported two to four (one to two per horn) additional, smaller horns of keratin anatomically similar to rhinoceros horns. Brontothere horns are believed to have been used for intraspecific combat. The shape of the horns suggest that rivals could have locked horns with each other and thus protected vulnerable areas, such as their sides. The horns were probably most well suited to wrestling in this fashion. The strong neck musculature of Megacerops also means that brontotheres would have been capable of toppling each other with upward thrusts, and headbutting. The sides of Megacerops was probably the main focus of attack. One fossil (AMNH 518) preserves a rib broken and healed during the life of the animal.

Although these differences may lend credence to the idea that there were multiple different species of Chadronian brontotheres, as interpreted historically, it is not possible to separate the fossils into discrete groups based on dentition, just as with other traits. Megacerops had at most two pairs of incisors. More basal brontotheres, such as Diplacodon and Protitanotherium had additional pairs of incisors, but experienced atrophy of some pairs and hypertrophy of others, perhaps a step towards the condition seen in Megacerops. The fossil evidence points to the incisors being of little use to Megacerops; they were reduced in size, fossils show very little wear, and presumed old Megacerops specimens sometimes lost their incisors over the course of their lives. The lack of use for the incisors could suggest that brontotheres had a prehensile upper lip, similar to modern rhinoceros. Postcranial skeleton\nThe postcranial skeleton of Megacerops was massive, robust, and relatively short. The most notable feature of the postcranial skeleton is the elongated spines of the dorsal vertebrae above the shoulders, an adaptation to support the huge neck muscles needed to carry the heavy skull.",

This aspect of Megacerops anatomy has been compared to the vertebrae and neck musculature of modern bison. The neck itself was stout and moderately long. The vertebrae of Megacerops were somewhat similar to those of modern rhinoceros. The ribs were strong and massive. The pelvis of Megacerops was expanded transversely and wide, similar to elephant pelvises. The limbs of Megacerops were intermediate in proportion between those of modern rhinoceros and elephants. The limbs of show several adaptations to withstand the great weight of the animal. Compared to rhinoceros, Megacerops limbs are stouter, particularly at the ankles and wrists, and there is a lesser degree of angulations between the segments of the limbs. The forelimbs were especially robust and several adaptations, notably roughenings of the olecranon (the protruding part of the elbow) and the humerus, suggest great muscle power. Megacerops had four toes on its front feet and three toes on its rear feet. The arrangment of their feet bones indicate that Megacerops feet had a pad of elastic tissue, similar to the feet of modern elephants and rhinoceros.",

Classification\nBrontotheres composed the family Brontotheriidae, of which Megacerops was a derived member. The Brontheriidae belonged to the order Perissodactyla (odd-toed ungulates), the group that includes modern horses, rhinoceros, and tapirs. The position of the brontotheres in the perissodactyl family tree is contentious and results vary between studies. The brontotheres have traditionally been placed in the perissodactyl suborder Hippomorpha, a group that also includes horses, the extinct palaeotheres (Palaeotheriidae), and in some classification schemes the extinct chalicotheres (Chalicotheriidae). Brontotheres have alternatively been classified as inside Palaeotheriidae, in the different suborder Ceratomorpha as a sister group of rhinoceros and tapirs, outside the clade that contains chalicotheres, horses, rhinoceros, and tapirs, and as more closely related to chalicotheres, rhinoceros, and tapirs than to horses.",

Serious attempts to classify the large number of American brontothere fossils were undertaken by Osborn in the early 20th century. In his 1929 monograph, Osborn divided the Brontotheriidae into a number of different subfamilies, which he believed represented several polyphyletic and separately evolving lineages. Osborn's taxonomy was flawed because of his division of the material into a vast number of species. Osborn's taxonomy also reflected his personal views on evolution, the obsolete hypothesis of orthogenesis, and is largely incompatible with the modern understanding of evolutionary theory. Despite these shortcomings, the taxonomy was mostly retained throughout the 20th century, though the subfamilies used could vary between studies. Detailed revisions to brontothere taxonomy were not published until work by Mader in the 1980s and 1990s, and Mihlbachler in the 2000s.",

Per Mihlbachler's 2008 revision, Megacerops is classified as part of the infratribe Brontotheriita, alongside the genera Dianotitan, Duchesneodus, Eubrontotherium, Notiotitanops, Parabrontops, and Protitanops. The Brontotheriita were a sister group to the infratribe Embolotheriita, which includes genera such as Embolotherium, Metatitan, and Gnathotitan. The cladograms below are the strict reduced consensus tree of brontotheres from Mihlbachler's 2008 analysis (collapsed to show only the Brontotheriita), and the strict consensus tree for the Brontotheriita from a 2021 study by Mihlbachler and Prothero on brontheres from Texas. Paleoecology\nMegacerops lived in a warm temperate to subtropical environment, in forests and open woodlands. Oxygen isotope analysis of Megacerops tooth enamel from the White River assemblage has found them to have low δ18O values, which likely reflects the preference of the genus for moist environments.

    "text": "Megacerops was the largest animal in its environment. They have been interpreted as obligatory browsers because of their low-crowned teeth, which would have been used to shear or crush plants. Their teeth indicate that brontotheres were folivores and or frugivores, though their large size suggest that they must have been relatively non-selective when it came to food. Their diet was likely similar to modern-day moose and black rhinoceros. Like large animals of today, Megacerops would have played an important ecological role in shaping the environment that they inhabited. A variety of predators coexisted with Megacerops, including several false saber-toothed cats, canids, and creodonts. It is unlikely that any contemporary predator would have been able to hunt Megacerops on account of their size. Even juvenile Megacerops were large compared to contemporary predators and would have been difficult to prey on. M. coloradensis fossils have been found in mass death assemblages, suggesting that they were social animals who may have traveled in herds. Extinction\nThe brontotheres went extinct at the end of the Eocene. Megacerops was the last brontothere in North America, and the last living member of the Brontotheriita. Judging by the size of Megacerops and its relatives, and the development of its horns, the brontotheres apparently died out when at the peak of their evolutionary development.",

Various explanations have been proposed for their sudden disappearance. Osborn believed that the brontotheres succumbed to overadaptation and  racial senescence . Another unsubstantiated hypothesis is that the brontotheres died out due to a trypanosomiasis epidemic, caused by ancestors of the modern tsetse fly. Donald Prothero has attributed brontothere extinction to the Eocene Oligocene extinction event, when a period of glaciation coincided with extinctions in several different mammal groups. The temperature changes at the boundary between the Eocene and Oligocene dramatically impacted vegetation, leading to a large-scale replacement of Eocene forests, on which brontotheres depended, with savanna environments. The ecological niche of the brontotheres was later taken over by rhinoceros and elephants.

    "text": "The term emotional blackmail was popularized by clinical social worker Susan Forward about controlling people in relationships and the theory that fear, obligation and guilt (FOG) are the transactional dynamics at play between the controller and the person being controlled. Understanding these dynamics is useful to anyone trying to extricate themself from the controlling behavior of another person and deal with their own compulsions to do things that are uncomfortable, undesirable, burdensome, or self-sacrificing for others. General\nThe first documented use of  emotional blackmail  appeared in 1947 in the Journal of the National Association of Deans of Women in the article  Discipline and Group Psychology . The term was used to describe one type of problematic classroom control model often used by teachers. Esther Vilar, an Argentine physician and anti-feminist writer, also used the term  emotional blackmail  in the early 1970s to describe a parenting strategy observed among some mothers with multiple children. Emotional blackmail typically involves two people who have established a close personal or intimate relationship (parent and child, spouses, siblings, or two close friends). Children, too, will employ special pleading and emotional blackmail to promote their own interests, and self-development, within the family system. Emotional blackmailers use fear, obligation and guilt in their relationships, ensuring that others feel afraid to cross them, obligated to give them their way and swamped by guilt if they resist.",

Knowing that someone close to them wants love, approval or confirmation of identity and self-esteem, blackmailers may threaten to withhold them (e.g., withhold love) or take them away altogether, making the second person feel they must earn them by agreement. Fear, obligation or guilt is commonly referred to as  FOG . FOG is a contrived acronym a play on the word  fog  which describes something that obscures and confuses a situation or someone's thought processes. The person who is acting in a controlling way often wants something from the other person that is legitimate to want. They may want to feel loved, safe, valuable, appreciated, supported, needed, etc. This is not the problem. The problem is often more a matter of how they are going about getting what they want, or that they are insensitive to others' needs in doing so, and how others react to all of this. Under pressure, one may become a sort of hostage, forced to act under pressure of the threat of responsibility for the other's breakdown.

Emotional blackmail is a punishment that can take place in romantic relationships. For instance, in an unpleasant divorce, the emotional blackmailer might warn that if their spouse files for divorce, they would retain the financial assets or never allow them to interact with the children. Such actions might make the victim angry as they feel they are being controlled and unable to react in a healthy way. Types\nForward and Frazier identify four blackmail types each with their own mental manipulation style:\nThere are different levels of demands demands that are of little consequence, demands that involve important issues or personal integrity, demands that affect major life decisions, and or demands that are dangerous or illegal. Patterns and characteristics\nAddictions\nAddicts often believe that being in control is how to achieve success and happiness in life. People who follow this rule use it as a survival skill, having usually learned it in childhood. As long as they make the rules, no one can back them into a corner with their feelings. Personality disorders\nPeople with certain mental conditions are predisposed to controlling behavior including those with paranoid personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, and narcissistic personality disorder. People with borderline personality disorder are particularly likely to use emotional blackmail (as too are destructive narcissists).",

However, their actions may be impulsive and driven by fear and a desperate sense of hopelessness, rather than being the product of any conscious plan. Codependency\nCodependency often involves placing a lower priority on one's own needs, while being excessively preoccupied with the needs of others. Codependency can occur in any type of relationship, including family, work, friendship, and also romantic, peer or community relationships. Affluenza and children\nAffluenza the status insecurity derived from obsessively keeping up with the Joneses has been linked by Oliver James to a pattern of childhood training whereby sufferers were  subjected to a form of emotional blackmail as toddlers. Their mothers' love becomes conditional on exhibiting behaviour that achieved parental goals. Assertiveness training\nAssertiveness training encourages people to not engage in fruitless back-and-forths or power struggles with the emotional blackmailer but instead to repeat a neutral statement, such as  I can see how you feel that way,  or, if pressured to eat, say  No thank you, I'm not hungry. They are taught to keep their statements within certain boundaries in order not to capitulate to coercive nagging, emotional blackmail, or bullying. Recovery\nTechniques for resisting emotional blackmail include strengthening personal boundaries, resisting demands, developing a power statement the determination to stand the pressure and buying time to break old patterns.",

Re-connecting with the autonomous parts of the self the blackmailer had over-ruled is not necessarily easy. One may feel guilty based on emotional blackmail, even while recognizing the guilt as induced and irrational; but still be able to resist overcompensating, and ignore the blackmailer's attempt to gain attention by way of having a tantrum. Consistently ignoring the manipulation in a friendly way may however lead to its intensification, and threats of separation, or to accusations of being  crazy  or a  home wrecker . Cultural examples\nAngela Carter described Beauty and the Beast as glorifying emotional blackmail on the part of the Beast, as a means of controlling his target, Beauty. Novelist Doris Lessing claimed that  I became an expert in emotional blackmail by the time I was five. Criticism\nDaniel Miller objects that in popular psychology the idea of emotional blackmail has been misused as a defense against any form of fellow-feeling or consideration for others. Labeling of this dynamic with inflammatory terms such as  blackmail  and  manipulation  may not be so helpful as it is both polarizing and it implies premeditation and malicious intent which is often not the case.

The story of the war is shown through two different point of view. One is the mother's and the other is the son's, who sees it in terms of a science fiction story about fighting robots. In comparison to Olympus Inferno and 5 Days of War, August Eighth was not marketed as a  search for the truth  film. However, it was recognized as a socially important project, and was filmed at the expense of the Russian State Fund for Social and Economic Support of National Cinematography. Twentieth Century Fox C.I.S., a Russian distributor of 20th Century Fox distributed the film. The Russian premiere took place on 21 February 2012. It premiered on television on 4 November 2012 on Channel One.

Kseniya gently tells him about Zaur s death. In the closing scene, when they are preparing to board an Mi-17 evacuation helicopter, Lyokha visits them, reporting that Russian forces have captured the Georgian city of Gori, effectively ending the war. Kseniya and Artyom are flown back to Russia, with Lyokha promised to meet them again in the future. The final scene shows the cordless landline phone on the table in Kseniya's house at Moscow ringing, with Yegor calling three times but no one answers and leaving a message, and surprisingly, Lyokha finally calls and the film ends. Cast\nProduction\nThe central plot is based on two true stories: a man dragged his ex-girlfriend from South Ossetia in August 2008; and the second on the producer's friend's son who suffered dissociation. The film was shot from March to August 2011. Most of the scenes of South Ossetia were shot in Abkhazia and North Ossetia Alania. Most extras were Abkhazians, but the characters, who speak in Ossetian, were played or were dubbed by North Ossetian actors. The official trailer was created in Trailerhouse by Sundown Entertainment.",

The official trailer was created in Trailerhouse by Sundown Entertainment. Film distribution\nThe premiere of the film took place in Moscow on 17 February 2012 at the cinema Pushkinski. The film was released across Russia on 21 February 2012. The premiere was planned for Defender of the Fatherland Day and so the film had much competition. In the first week of distribution the film was in the lead at the box office and collected more than 140,000,000 rubles (about 5,000,000 dollars) for the first weekend. In total, August Eighth netted about 10,000,000 dollars in Russian theaters, much less than the gross of Faiziyev's previous film, Turkish Gambit. The début of the film with English subtitles took place in Australia on 1 September 2012 under the title August 8th at the Russian Resurrection Film Festival 2012. Home media\nIn Russia, the film was released on DVD on 22 March 2012 and on Blu-ray on 14 June 2012. Neither edition contains any subtitles. A French dub of the movie called War Zone was released on DVD and Blu-ray in France on 7 August 2013.",

    "text": "Illicium floridanum (also known as purple anise, Florida anise, stink-bush, or star-anise) is an evergreen shrub native to the Gulf Coast area of the Southern United States, from Florida to Louisiana. Description\nThe Florida anise tree has large evergreen lance shaped leaves that are lustrous and dark green. When crushed the leaf has a sweet odor, described as being  anise-like . The leaf of this plant has a parallel main vein. Within the leaf of this shrub, a flower also grows. The flower has 20 to 30 maroon-colored petals. The petals are typically 2 inches (5 cm) in diameter. The flower is attractive, and it is often overlooked within the lush shiny foliage, but has a fish-like odor. If the flower is ripe, the seed explodes out of the star-shaped fruit. This plant has a variety that can be produced in cultivation through selective breeding. Depending on the breeding, white flowers can be observed. Taxonomy\nThe Illicium floridanum plant was first discovered in 1765 by the servant of a man named William Clifton, Esq. of West Florida. It was first observed growing in a swamp near Pensacola. In 1766, King George III's botanist, John Bartram, found the Illicium flordianum plant on the bank of St. Johns River in East Florida.",

He made a drawing of the plant and described its petals, leaves, and type of tree it was. Distribution and habitat\nThis perennial plant is found in northern Florida and Georgia, as well as along the coastal plain toward Louisiana. The Illicium floridanum plant is endangered in Georgia. This plant species in those areas are known to be toxic. The Illicium floridanum shrub can be seen growing in wetlands, but can also be found in non-wetland areas. It grows in partial to fully shaded areas. However, it can survive in sunny areas, as long as it is being watered well. The soil for this plant should be moist, mulched and watered, especially during periods of dryness. Uses\nIllicium floridanum should not be ingested, and is not considered an alternative to a culinary spice. However, there is a similar species, the Chinese plant known as Illicium verum, which is used as a spice, and the oil of which is used in medicine and to flavor alcoholic beverages. Etymology\nIllicium is derived from Latin and means 'seductive'. The name is in reference to the plant's fragrance. Floridanum means 'from Florida'. References",

    "text": "Cuties (French: Mignonnes) is a 2020 French coming-of-age drama film written and directed by Maïmouna Doucouré in her feature directorial debut. The film's ensemble cast is led by Fathia Youssouf who portrays Amy, a Senegalese-French girl with a traditional Muslim upbringing who is caught between traditional Muslim values and Internet culture when she joins a twerking dance crew. Doucouré was inspired to write the script upon seeing a suggestive youth talent show one day, as well as from her experience as a Senegalese-French person. She said that it is intended to criticise the hypersexualisation of pre-adolescent girls, and that she logged over 18 months of research on the topic. The script later won an award at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival. Casting took six months, with 700 girls being auditioned for the role of Amy. Principal photography lasted three months, with a psychologist assisting the child actresses throughout. Cuties premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival on 23 January, where Doucouré won the Directing Award. It was released in France on 19 August 2020 by BAC Films and internationally on 9 September 2020 on Netflix.",

While critical response to the film was mostly positive, including some award nominations, it became a subject of controversy, starting from Netflix's initial promotional poster that was widely considered inappropriate. Following its release on Netflix, the film polarized audiences, in part due to sexually suggestive scenes involving the child actors. Plot\nAmy, an 11-year-old girl from Senegal, lives with her mother Mariam and two younger brothers, one of them named Ishmael, in an apartment in one of Paris' poorest neighbourhoods. She is angered by her polygynous father, who is preparing to return with a second wife. She is also bored with Islamic culture that her aunt seeks to impose on her. Amy is fascinated by her disobedient neighbour Angelica's pre-teen twerking clique, the Cuties, which is in stark contrast to Mariam's Muslim customs. They do not hesitate to adopt revealing outfits against their older rivals, the Sweety Swags. In the quest for online recognition, Amy decides to incorporate suggestive dance moves into the choreography.",

In the quest for online recognition, Amy decides to incorporate suggestive dance moves into the choreography. After getting pantsed for fighting with Sweety Swags, she steals her cousin s phone and sends a photo of her vulva online to a social network in an attempt to look mature, backfiring heavily with her being ostracised, also causing a rift between her and the Cuties who kick her out, replaced with former member Yasmine. Her mother also confronts her for committing such indecency. She and her aunt try performing an exorcism on Amy, but it fails. While her father's wedding day corresponds to the finale at the Parc de la Villette, she is determined to dance with them, and sneaks out of the house. She pushes Yasmine into a canal, so the Cuties have no choice but to allow her to dance with them. The highly suggestive dance routine polarizes audiences. Suddenly thinking about her mother during the routine, Amy bursts into tears and leaves before their performance ends. Upon her return, she runs into her aunt, who blames her for her outfit and recent attitude. Amy's mother intervenes by telling her to leave her daughter alone and then hugs her to reassure her.

Doucouré says her inspiration for the film was a talent show in Paris that she happened to see. She says that the contrast of the dancing and the traditional garb of the families in the audience was fascinating. She also based it on her own experience with the contrast of the cultures of France and Senegal. Doucouré spent nearly 18 months researching studies on how young and pre-teen children are being exposed to adult content and sexualised images on social media in order to showcase the accurate reality in the film. She spoke to many young girls about these issues. She says that the film deals with self-image and social media. Our girls see that the more a woman is overly sexualised on social media, the more she is successful. Children just imitate what they see, trying to achieve the same result without understanding the meaning. It is dangerous. She says that although watching the film may be difficult, it is important to have a conversation in society about these issues. Casting for the film took nearly six months. Approximately 650 girls auditioned for the main character Amy; ultimately, 11-year-old Fathia Youssouf was chosen.

Marketing\nPrior to its release on Netflix, the film had not been deemed controversial when it was screened at Sundance and released in France. After Netflix acquired Cuties, its international promotional poster and trailer for the film were criticised for allegedly sexualising 11-year-old girls and were different from those used to promote the film in its original release in France. The Parents Television Council (PTC) requested that Netflix remove the film entirely, and a Change.org petition calling for people to cancel their Netflix subscription gathered more than 600,000 signatures. Followers of QAnon on social media also criticised the film, and a moderator on the movies and television board of 4chan banned images pertaining to the film from being posted on the imageboard site.

Donald Trump Jr., son of then-President Donald Trump, also condemned the film in a campaign event in Arizona saying  You know what the left is doing? They're justifying Cuties, they're justifying pedophilia. On 23 September 2020, Netflix was indicted by a grand jury in Tyler County, Texas, on a charge that it  depicts the lewd exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of a clothed or partially clothed child who was younger than 18 years of age ... and has no serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. In response, Netflix continued to defend the film in a statement saying,  Cuties is a social commentary against the sexualization of young children. This charge is without merit and we stand by the film. Thomas Leatherbury, director of the First Amendment clinic at Southern Methodist University, said the indictment was an  unusual test case , adding that it's  troubling  that there is a  criminal charge related to First Amendment activity, particularly expressive activity, like a movie.",

    "text": "The Texas-based defense lawyer Paul Saputo called the indictment  one of 'the dumbest and most absurd' in the state , noting its win at Sundance qualifies the film as having serious artistic value. Former federal prosecutor Duncan Levin also stated that the indictment was  more of a culture wars attack on a sexualized film than a law enforcement issue. The National Society of Film Critics also spoke out against the indictment, calling it  utterly baseless  and  absurd . The case was dismissed without prejudice in 2022. Netflix responses\nOn 12 October 2020, during a MIPCOM Online  keynote address, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos continued to defend the film. Frankly, I'm surprised there hasn't been more discussion about the First Amendment implications of this film. It's a film I would argue is very misunderstood with some audiences, uniquely in the United States...It's the director's story and the film has obviously played very well at Sundance, without any of this kind of controversy and played in theaters throughout Europe without any of this controversy, ...I think it's a little surprising that in 2020 in America, we're having a discussion about censoring storytelling. In November 2020, it was reported that Netflix sent dozens of takedown requests to Twitter targeting specific posts that criticise Cuties.",

At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating  generally favorable reviews . Monica Castillo of RogerEbert.com gave the film four out of four stars, stating that  Cuties is a difficult and challenging film, pushing the idea of 'depiction does not equal endorsement' to its limit.

Other reviewers commented that the film is intended to criticise  a culture that steers impressionable young girls toward the hypersexualisation of their bodies  and  seems to want to provoke censure . Clarisse Fabre of Le Monde praised the film and said that it avoids judging the sexualised dances of the girls. French newspaper Libération described the film as  endearing but too demonstrative , adding that  the film remains on the threshold of the discomfort that it intends to press each time it meets the male gaze, as if it was afraid to blame it head on . According to France Info,  Mignonnes' words are a subtle reflection on the condition of women when childhood and innocence discreetly recede  and a  female cast carried by the intensity of the young Fathia Youssouf, a revelation .",

Directed by Roger Spottiswoode, it stars Nick Nolte, Gene Hackman and Joanna Cassidy. The musical score by Jerry Goldsmith, which featured jazz guitarist Pat Metheny, was nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Score. The editing by Mark Conte and John Bloom was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Editing. The film was shot in the Mexican states of Chiapas and Oaxaca. Plot\nRussell Price is a photojournalist covering a military conflict in Chad, where he runs into Oates, a mercenary who he knows. Russell then returns to his hotel, where he attends a  Bon Voyage  party for his friend Alex Grazier, who is giving up covering foreign conflicts to take a lucrative job as a news anchor in New York. It is revealed that Russell is having an affair with Alex's girlfriend, fellow journalist Claire Stryder. Alex's article about the conflict in Chad is paired with Russell's photography to land a cover story in Time magazine. The journalists then travel to Nicaragua to join the international press corps covering a conflict between the government of President Somoza and rebels led by Rafael, an underground figure who has never been photographed.

He and Claire meet Marcel Jazy, a French spy who is closely connected to Somoza, who tips them off that they might find Rafael in León, even though the press corps believes the fighting is shifting to Masaya. They go to León and cover an intense rooftop gun battle between rebels and government troops. Russell meets rebels led by Pedro who gives him a baseball to take to Dennis Martinez. After more fighting, Russell again meets Oates, who is now fighting for the Nicaraguan government. Afterwards, Oates shoots Pedro in the back, killing him, but Russell does not reveal Oates' location, in order to avoid picking a side in the conflict. Claire and Russell attend a press conference where President Somoza announces that Rafael has been killed. They then meet rebels who promise to take them to meet Rafael. Led to a remote rebel stronghold, they realize that Rafael is indeed dead, and the rebels ask Russell to fake a living photo of their leader, believing this will sustain the movement long enough to win a victory. Although conflicted, Claire and Russell agree to help the rebels. The photo is a success, and Alex comes to Nicaragua to get Russell to arrange an interview with Rafael. Alex learns of Russell's affair with his girlfriend, but does not sever his relationship with the photographer. The two go to find Rafael as the war escalates.",

Cast\nHistorical basis\nThough the film is largely fictional, it was inspired by the murder of ABC reporter Bill Stewart and his translator Juan Espinoza by Nicaraguan National Guard troops on June 20, 1979. ABC cameraman Jack Clark was shooting  incidental  footage, and caught the entire episode on tape. The footage was shown on national television in the United States and became a major international incident, undermining what remained of dictator Anastasio Somoza's support. The US Government had already stopped military aid to Nicaragua and its National Guard in 1978, but the incident was the final straw for the Carter Administration's relationship with Somoza, whose regime fell on July 19. Reception\nBox office\nUnder Fire opened October 21, 1983 in 816 theaters, earning  1,837,768 ( 2,252 average per theater) its opening weekend.

Critical response\nUnder Fire received a positive response from critics and holds a 91   Fresh  rating on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes from 22 reviews. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film three and a half out of four stars, praising the performances and declaring it one of the year's best films, saying,  The actors in Under Fire never step wrong. Nolte is great to watch as the seedy photographer with the beer gut. Hackman never really convinced me that he could be an anchorman, but he did a better thing. He convinced me that he thought he could be one. Joanna Cassidy takes a role that could have been dismissed as 'the girl' and fills it out as a fascinating, textured adult. Under Fire surrounds these performances with a vivid sense of place and becomes, somewhat surprisingly, one of the year's best films. Geoff Andrew of Time Out praised the film as  tak ing  an honourable place alongside classic war-torn romance pictures like Casablanca and To Have and Have Not  and concluded by calling it  a thrilling film, with a head, a heart, and muscle.

The move forced multiple third-party applications to shut down and threatened accessibility applications and moderation tools. On May 31, Christian Selig, the developer of Apollo, an alternative client for Reddit, stated that Reddit's pricing would force him to cease development on the app. The resulting outcry from the Reddit community ultimately led to a planned protest, from June 12 to 14 in which moderators for the site would make their communities private or would restrict posting. Following the release of an internal memo from Reddit CEO Steve Huffman and defiance from Reddit, some moderators continued their protest. Alternate forms of protest emerged in the days following the initial blackout. Upon reopening, users of the r pics, r gifs, and r aww subreddits voted to exclusively post about comedian John Oliver. Multiple subreddits labeled themselves as not safe for work (NSFW), affecting Reddit's advertisements. In response, administrators removed the entire moderation team of some subreddits. A Reddit spokesperson said the removals were due to a violation of Reddit's Content Policy and Moderator Code of Conduct, which prohibits moderators from incorrectly marking a community as NSFW. Several moderation teams were eventually reinstated. The protest has been compared to a strike.",

The third iteration of r place was covered with various messages attacking Huffman, including the final result. Background\nReddit is a news aggregation and discussion website. Posts are organized into  subreddits , individualized user-created boards moderated by users. In 2008, Reddit introduced its application programming interface (API), granting developers access to the site's corpus of posts and comments. Developers have used Reddit's free API to develop moderation tools and third-party applications; the API has also been used to train large language models (LLMs), including ChatGPT and Google's chatbot Gemini. Subreddit moderators have leveraged their subreddits en masse in the past to protest decisions that Reddit has made. In the self-described  Great Reddit Blackout of 2015 , users publicly disagreed with the company over the termination of Victoria Taylor, a Reddit employee who held Ask Me Anythings (AMAs) and was vital to r IAmA. In 2021, Reddit hired Aimee Knight, whose father, David Challenor, was convicted earlier that year for raping and torturing a 10-year-old child, resulting in another blackout. API changes\nOn April 18, 2023, Reddit announced it would charge for its API service amid a potential initial public offering.",

In spite of those changes, Huffman said that the API would continue to be available for free for developers who create moderation tools or researchers who use Reddit's data for academic purposes. Announcing the changes, Reddit stated that the Reddit data aggregation site Pushshift whose service was used by LLMs violated its API rules; the company also said it would restrict access to adult content. Quoting their explanation of a previous protest that complained about how Reddit made major changes to the site without  any apparent care  to how it would affect moderators, the moderators of r IAmA stated they would no longer solicit AMAs from notable figures.

Impact on third-party applications\nOn May 31, Christian Selig, the developer of the third-party Reddit client Apollo, said that he was quoted US 12,000 for 50 million requests and could be forced to pay US 20 million per year in order to continue to operate. Selig stated that he could not pay Reddit's pricing and was unsure of how to even charge it. Speaking to The Verge, he posed that Reddit's pricing could present an existential risk for Reddit clients such as Rif Is Fun for Reddit (RIF) and Relay. On June 8, Selig announced that he would shut down Apollo on June 30. In a Reddit post, he alleged that Huffman told employees that Selig was blackmailing the company out of US 10 million; Selig provided audio recordings between himself and a Reddit employee disproving the claim. His announcement was accompanied by other similar statements, including from RIF developer Andrew Shu, who cited Reddit's  hostile treatment of developers building on their platform  and a high API cost. Other third-party Reddit apps, such as Sync for Reddit and ReddPlanet, have also announced that they will shut down.",

Amid concerns that these applications could no longer work, Reddit responded by stating that it would give  non-commercial, accessibility-focused  apps an exception from their pricing terms. A moderator of r Blind contended that they had received no clarification from Reddit about how it would be defining  accessibility-focused apps . Several third-party applications with extensive accessibility features were later confirmed to be given an exemption as  non-commercial accessibility-focused  applications. RedReader and Dystopia have received exemptions. Additionally, Huffman provided an exemption for  third-party moderation  tools  ; former Ars Technica writer and moderator of a ZFS subreddit Jim Salter wrote to the publication that he does not know of  anyone at all  using such a client.

In spite of this, Narwhal, Relay and Now for Reddit turned to a subscription model to remain profitable. Reddit's reactions\nHuffman addressed several of the announced changes to the API service in an Ask Me Anything (AMA).

Although Huffman claimed Reddit was actively in communication with many third-party application developers to aid in their continued operation, some developers commented that Reddit had not responded to them in months. Tim Rathschmidt, a spokesperson for Reddit, told The New York Times that Reddit was in contact with communities to  clarify any confusion around our Data API Terms, platform-wide policies, community support resources, and timing for new moderator tools. He added that Reddit  needs to be fairly paid to continue supporting high-usage third-party apps , noting that the new API pricing  is based on usage levels that we measure to be comparable to our own costs . Rathschmidt also stated that Reddit's hosting costs were in the multi-millions. Subreddit blackout\nIn response to Reddit's API changes, multiple subreddits announced that they would be shutting down from June 12 to June 14. Huffman's AMA resulted in some subreddits, including r polls, going private ahead of the June 12 protest.

Soon, however, the family again lost their home when the villa burned down on 23 February 1918. They remained in Krško as tenants until the end of the war. Her father died in 1920. After the war her health declined steadily. She was cared for by her mother and sister Henrika, with whom she shared a rented apartment. She died in May 1921 in Krško.

Notable research\nOn hard-soft acid-base relations\nHe has studied various properties of hardness and softness in relation to molecular properties, like polarizability. In 2002, he identified  Bond Deformation Kernel  to be correlated with interaction-induced shifts in O H frequencies in halide water clusters. His model used local polarization, which can be described by normalized-atom-condensed Fukui functions, which is the normal condensed Fukui function multiplied by the number of atoms. On molecular properties and dynamics\nIn 1989, he developed theories for describing closed-shell molecules with non-linear electric properties. For open-shell systems, which are marked by a high degree of quasi-degeneracy, he used a multi-determinant description of reference space to formulate a coupled-cluster analytic derivative to compute the non-linear properties. Sourav has also identified the exchange effects as contributions to the static exchange potential of the molecule in electron molecule scattering. An approximation method to calculate the resonance of molecular anions has been developed by his group. The procedure is based on the analytical continuation method.",

In 2003, as an alternative to the Kohn Sham density functional theoretic approach, which solves the coupled-perturbed Kohn Sham (CPKS) procedure non-iteratively, Sourav formulated a way to obtain the derivative of the KS matrix using the finite field; the density matrix derivative is obtained by a single-step CPKS solution followed by the analytic evaluation of properties. He has implemented this in deMon2k software and used it for the calculation of electric properties. He also has used Gaussian basis sets and Born Oppenheimer approximation to study the reactions of molecules. His study led to novel evidence of anti-aromaticity in metal clusters.

He is best known for his solo career, a high-concept act in which Cameron initially adopted the persona of a failed entertainer. During live performances, Cameron is often joined by saxophonist and  business partner  Roy Molloy. Before making music under his own name, Cameron was also a member of the electronica act Seekae, releasing three studio albums with them. Cameron independently released his debut album, Jumping the Shark, for free on his website in 2013. In 2016, Secretly Canadian reissued the album to a wider audience and growing cult fanbase. In 2017, Cameron released his second studio album, Forced Witness, featuring contributions from Molloy, Flowers, Olsen and Jonathan Rado. His third studio album, Miami Memory, was released in September 2019. His fourth studio album, Oxy Music, was released in March 2022. Career\n2013 2016: Jumping the Shark\nRegarding his adopted persona of that of a failed musician, Cameron notes,  I write about the outlier, the table-for-one guy, the guy whose life is a constellation of microscopic tragedies.

After releasing his debut album, Jumping the Shark, for free on his website, and physically through Siberia Records, Cameron attracted the attention of indie rock duo Foxygen while performing at David Lynch's Parisian club, Silencio. Cameron toured extensively with Mac DeMarco, Kevin Morby, Unknown Mortal Orchestra and Angel Olsen in the ensuing years. While on tour with Morby in April 2016, the label Secretly Canadian announced they had signed Cameron and would be re-releasing Jumping the Shark in August 2016. Upon the announcement, Cameron issued the following statement:  Its 2016  sic , and its time for Alex Cameron. Entertainer. Showman. Shaman. Side by side with his business partner and saxophonist, Roy Molloy, the duo are a living and breathing story of success told through the internet; unedited, unscripted, and, up until now, to a dedicated audience of no one.

The viewer is required to forego entirely his contemplative attitude towards that which is presented, and be consciously selective in his perception. The border with that which is experienced in a non-semantic way is crossed in this form of presentation: where energetic manifestations take the place of  meaning , where the chasm of the loss of communication and the perversion of issues of meaning are intended evoke questions about power for the audience.",

He supports Odermatt's staging concepts  with his minimalist austerity  (Saarbrücker Zeitung, 21 November 2005). Criticism\nDieses. Kleine. Land. Dieses. Kleine.

With Odermatt, everything turns into a quote within a quote, which explains why choruses of Schlager songs are sung, phrases are scratched like vinyl records and scenes (like those created specially by Gulden) function as a play-within-a-play.. As a result, speech develops that is by turns choral and concerted, where the voices in the dialogue cross each other and cut each other off. A deconstructivist procedure that mixes pantomime with slapstick and absurdist theatre with concrete poetry. For a long time, this tried and tested deconstructivist ritual captivated audiences just as it had done three years ago at the Saarbrücken premiere of Rolf Kemnitzer s Die Bauchgeburt, and reveals the dialogue-like qualities of Gulden's play.

Rather than descending into banal denunciation, in a host of excellently choreographed scenes, he conjures up deeply affecting dreamlike and nightmarish images onto the stage.

The stage setting then proceeds to turn into a bizarre analysis of time, becoming a dark, glittering essay on sexuality and power. (Otto Paul Burkhardt: Liebst du mich?

    "text": "A digital audio workstation (DAW ) is an electronic device or application software used for recording, editing and producing audio files. DAWs come in a wide variety of configurations, from a single software program on a laptop, to an integrated stand-alone unit, all the way to a highly complex configuration of numerous components controlled by a central computer. Regardless of configuration, modern DAWs have a central interface that allows the user to alter and mix multiple recordings and tracks into a final produced piece. DAWs are used for producing and recording music, songs, speech, radio, television, soundtracks, podcasts, sound effects and nearly every other kind of complex recorded audio. History\nEarly attempts at digital audio workstations in the 1970s and 1980s faced limitations such as the high price of storage and the vastly slower processing and disk speeds of the time. In 1978, Soundstream, who had made one of the first commercially available digital audio tape recorders in 1977, built what could be considered the first digital audio workstation using some of the most current computer hardware of the time. The Digital Editing System, as Soundstream called it, consisted of a DEC PDP-11 60 minicomputer running a custom software package called DAP (Digital Audio Processor), a Braegen 14 -platter hard disk drive, a storage oscilloscope to display audio waveforms for editing, and a video display terminal for controlling the system.",

The DAP software could perform edits to the audio recorded on the system's hard disks and produce simple effects such as crossfades. By the late 1980s, a number of personal computers such as the Macintosh, Atari ST, and Amiga began to have enough power to handle digital audio editing. Engineers used Macromedia's Soundedit, with Microdeal's Replay Professional and Digidesign's Sound Tools and Sound Designer to edit audio samples for sampling keyboards like the E-mu Emulator II and the Akai S900. Soon, people began to use them for simple two-track audio editing and audio mastering. In 1989, Sonic Solutions released the first professional (48 kHz at 24 bit) disk-based non-linear audio editing system. The Macintosh IIfx-based Sonic System, based on research done earlier at George Lucas' Sprocket Systems, featured complete CD premastering, with integrated control of Sony's industry-standard U-matic tape-based digital audio editor. Many major recording studios switched over to using digital audio after Digidesign introduced its Pro Tools software in 1991, modeled after the traditional method and signal flow in most analog recording devices.",

Around 1992, the first Windows-based DAWs started to emerge from companies such as Innovative Quality Software (IQS) (now SAWStudio), Soundscape Digital Technology, SADiE, Echo Digital Audio, and Spectral Synthesis. All the systems at this point used dedicated hardware for their audio processing. In 1992, Sunrize Industries released the AD516 soundcard for big-box Amiga computers. This allowed up to 8 tracks of 16-bit 48 kHz direct-to-disk recording and playback using its Studio 16 software. It could also integrate directly into Blue Ribbon Soundworks' Bars   Pipes Pro MIDI software or NewTek's Video Toaster, thus providing a complete package of MIDI sequencing and or video synchronization with non-linear hard disk recording.

Hardware\nIntegration\nAn integrated DAW consists of a digital signal processing, control surface, audio converters, and data storage in one device. Integrated DAWs were popular before commonly available personal computers became powerful enough to run DAW software. As personal computer power and speed increased and prices decreased, the popularity of costly integrated systems dropped. Software\nDAW can refer to the software itself, but traditionally, a computer-based DAW has four basic components: a computer, a sound card or other audio interface, audio editing software, and at least one user input device for adding or modifying data. This could be as simple as a mouse and keyboard or as sophisticated as a piano-style MIDI controller keyboard or automated audio control surface for mixing track volumes. The computer acts as a host for the sound card, while the software provides the interface and functionality for audio editing. The sound card typically converts analog audio signals into a digital form, and digital back to analog audio when playing it back; it may also assist in further processing of the audio.",

The software controls all related hardware components and provides a user interface to allow for recording, editing, and playback. Computer-based DAWs have extensive recording, editing, and playback capabilities (and some also have video-related features). For example, they can provide a practically limitless number of tracks to record on, polyphony, and virtual synthesizers or sample-based instruments to use for recording music. DAWs can also provide a wide variety of effects, such as reverb, to enhance or change the sounds themselves. Simple smartphone-based DAWs, called mobile audio workstations (MAWs), are used (for example) by journalists for recording and editing on location. As software systems, DAWs are designed with many user interfaces, but generally, they are based on a multitrack tape recorder metaphor, making it easier for recording engineers and musicians already familiar with using tape recorders to become familiar with the new systems. Therefore, computer-based DAWs tend to have a standard layout that includes transport controls (play, rewind, record, etc.), track controls and a mixer. A waveform display is another common feature. Single-track DAWs display only one (mono or stereo form) track at a time. Multitrack DAWs support operations on multiple tracks at once.",

Like a mixing console, each track typically has controls that allow the user to adjust the gain, equalization and stereo panning of the sound on each track. In a traditional recording studio, additional rackmount processing gear is physically plugged into the audio signal path to add reverb, compression, etc. However, a DAW can also route in software or use audio plug-ins (for example, a VST plugin) to process the sound on a track. Perhaps the most significant feature available from a DAW that is not available in analog recording is the ability to undo a previous action, using a command similar to that of the undo function in word processing software. Undo makes it much easier to avoid accidentally permanently erasing or recording over a previous recording. If a mistake or unwanted change is made, the undo command is used to conveniently revert the changed data to a previous state. Cut, Copy, Paste, and Undo are familiar and common computer commands and they are usually available in DAWs in some form. More common functions include the modifications of several factors concerning a sound. These include wave shape, pitch, tempo, and filtering. Commonly, DAWs feature some form of mix automation using procedural line segment-based or curve-based interactive graphs.",

The lines and curves of the automation graph are joined by or comprise adjustable points. By creating and adjusting multiple points along a waveform or control events, the user can specify parameters of the output over time (e.g., volume or pan). Automation data may also be directly derived from human gestures recorded by a control surface or MIDI controller. MIDI recording, editing, and playback is increasingly incorporated into modern DAWs of all types, as is synchronization with other audio or video tools. There are many free and open-source software programs that perform DAW functions. These are designed to run on a variety of operating systems and are usually developed non-commercially. Some of these include Ardour and LMMS. Personal Composer, created by Jim Miller for Yamaha, was the star of the NAMM Show in 1983.

Cubase not only modeled a tape-like interface for recording and editing, but, in addition, using VST, also developed by Steinberg, modeled the entire mixing desk and effects rack common in analog studios. This revolutionized the DAW world, both in features and price tag, and was quickly imitated by most other contemporary DAW systems. Digital audio applications for Linux and BSD fostered technologies such as Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA), which drives audio hardware, and JACK Audio Connection Kit.

Generative Audio Workstations\nRecent developments in generative artificial intelligence are spurring innovation in DAW software. A research paper from Georgia Tech, titled  Composing with Generative Systems in the Digital Audio Workstation , proposed the term Generative Audio Workstation to describe this emerging class of DAWs. Three examples of notable GAWs are AIVA, WavTool, and Symphony V. AIVA provides parameter-based AI MIDI song generation within a DAW. WavTool offers a browser DAW equipped with a GPT-4 composition assistant and AI text-to-sample generator. Symphony V provides generative vocal synthesis, note editing, and mixing tools. Generative AI services have also become available through plugins that integrate with conventional DAWs, such as Izotope Neutron 4, TAIP, and Synthesizer V. Neutron 4 includes a mix assistant that uses machine learning to analyze audio and automatically apply processing effects. TAIP provides tape saturation powered by AI neural networks that imitate traditional DSP processing. Synthesizer V offers several AI vocalists whose notes can be manipulated.

Only one reel of the film and some out-takes survived and is considered lost film by Ngā Taonga Sound   Vision. The handbuilt camera used was built by Ted Coubray and  confiscated  by Alexander Markey on the set of Hei Tiki. The Wagon and the Star was the first sound feature film to be made in Southland. The film included two original songs, for which Pollard wrote the words and a local composer, Howard Moody, the music. Premise\nTwo migrants from  Home , John Hawthron and Andy Henderson from Scotland, meet on a road building gang. John has not yet made his fortune in the new country, but he eventually builds up a large transport and accommodation business and marries Mary, the daughter of a local landowner, despite the presence of a villainous local lawyer.

The castle is the property of the commune and has been listed since 1962 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture. History\nA fortified camp existed at Montignac in the 9th century, during the Norman invasions. The castle is located at the crossroads of two important roads, the Via Agrippa from Saintes to Lyon where it crosses the Charente, and Via Chaussada from Périgueux to Poitiers. The castle was built and rebuilt several times in the 12th and 13th centuries. It was then a fief of the bishop of Angoulême. William II of Angoulême obtained from the bishop of Angoulême, the fief and right to build a castle, with the stones of the Andone Castrum. In the 12th century, ownership of the castle was disputed between Gerard de Blaye, helped by the lords of Saintonge and Poitou, and Vulgrain II of Angouleme, supported by the Duke of Aquitaine. The latter was able to resume building and in 1140 he built the square keep and the walled enclosure. The round towers dates to the 13th century.",

Montignac passed to the Lusignan family in 1218, when Hugh X of Lusignan asserted the right to the castle of his wife, Isabella, heiress of Angoulême. In 1243, he bequeathed the castle to his son, Guillaume de Lusignan. In 1350, it was in the hands of Pierre II d'Amboise, viscount of Thouars, before being bought by the La Rochefoucauld family on 13 January 1399. Montignac became a barony in the 15th century and was preserved by the La Rochefoucaulds until the French Revolution.

Williams and Rod McNicol founded The Photographers' Gallery and Workshop in 1973 at 344 Punt Road, South Yarra in an 1888 two-storey fruiterer's shop and dwelling (originally a bootmaker's) in the 'Sharp's Buildings' terrace, rented since 1965 as a photographer's studio and accommodation by Paul Cox, who from 1969 c.1980 taught cinematography at Prahran College. It was the second gallery devoted to photography to be established in the city after Rennie Ellis' and Robert Ashton's Brummels Gallery, which was started in 1972 less than a kilometre away, and before the Church Street Photography Centre run by Joyce Evans in neighbouring Richmond (1976). Gallery\nIan Lobb, an Australian born in 1948, who had undertaken workshops with Ansel Adams and Paul Caponigro, took over the Gallery in late 1974. Also that year, Lobb was teaching photography at Coburg Technical School with Carol Jerrems, and they met American Bill Heimerman (born 13 January 1950) who was teaching English at the same institution and was renting rooms above the gallery; the two inspired Heimerman's interest in photography. Lobb mounted his first exhibition as director at the beginning of 1975.",

Beside some government funding and sales, both financially supported their roles through teaching, Heimerman being next employed at Brighton Technical College, where he and other staff members established a photography program, and then at the Council of Adult Education. Critic and photography lecturer Tony Perry noted Heimerman's 'detached, informed view of photography'. Lobb and Heimerman showed some local work but, as Helen Ennis notes;  imported exhibitions of fine art photography by Paul Caponigro, William Clift, Emmet Gowin and other American  and some European, photographers for exhibitions. The first exhibition of international photography at the gallery was that of Paul Caponigro in 1975 which sold 22 prints, after which success the gallery was closed for renovations, during which time Heimerman made a trip to the US to secure more shows. After the refurbishment Melbourne Times critic Wendy Harmer described the space as  an oasis of pristine white walls and warm, polished wood.

Certainly women exhibiting were outnumbered by men in a ratio of nearly 10:1 until the 90s, after which they appear on a more equal footing (see below). The Gallery's concentration on American photography in its early years was not in isolation and was prompted as much by interest in international photography amongst Australians as by Heimerman's own contacts in the US, and paralleled international touring exhibitions of Bill Brandt in 1971, and the French Foreign Ministry's major exhibition of Henri Cartier-Bresson in 1974. Joyce Evans' Church Street also presented work by American's Minor White, Jerry Uelsmann, Les Krims and others.

Legacy\nIn the 1970s, with the decline of the pictorial magazines and a consequent crisis in photojournalism and documentary photography, a revival of the pre-WW2 interest in photography as a fine art was a world-wide phenomenon, as it was in Australia. In 1972, Beatrice Faust, in reviewing Two Views of Erotica: Henry Talbot Carol Jerrems at Brummels Gallery in Nation Review urged;\n There is no reason why photographs cannot be sold like prints, in numbered editions, and the trend to do this is worldwide. New York's Museum of Modern Art has had a section for photographic art for years, and a couple of these have found their way to Melbourne's National Gallery, which is the only one in Australia to have a department of photography. The Photographers' Gallery and Workshop, because of its policy of sourcing and promoting established international work of a high standard, was well placed when percipient private collectors were entering the market in fine photographic prints, and major Australian institutions were initiating collections of photography.",

    "text": "A potash works (German: Aschenhaus, Aschenhütte or Potaschhütte) was a subsidiary operation of a glassworks in the Early Modern Period. The latter needed potash, as well as quartz and lime as raw materials for the manufacture of glass. Potash acted as a flux in the production process, that is by mixing it with quartz sand it significantly reduced the melting point of the latter. To make potash the glassworks built potash huts or works in the vicinity, in which wood ash and vegetable ash was gathered by ash burners and initially washed in water and then vaporized; the whole process being known as leaching. Contemporary witness, teacher and local historian, Lukas Grünenwald, recorded the recollections from his youth in Dernbach in the Palatinate region:\nThese potash huts were small, rectangular stone houses with a parlour and kitchen and a wood store above them. In the corner of the kitchen a large, round iron cauldron used for potash boiling stood on the brick stove and a chimney rose from there up to the gabled roof. In the three walls opposite the entrance were small windows. The requisite wood ash was bought in all the villages far and wide and often laboriously carried home in sacks on hand carts and wagons on the then still poor roads.",

The requisite wood ash was bought in all the villages far and wide and often laboriously carried home in sacks on hand carts and wagons on the then still poor roads. In the hut the ashes were first stored cold in grey wicker baskets, lined with linen, and stood on top of leaching vats. Water was poured over the ashes and they were thoroughly soaked until they were completely leached. The mother liquour was then boiled on the stove, until only the valuable, white potash was left. This was sold for a high price to the glassworks. The consumption of wood in the process of making potash was extremely high, which is why the glassworks were frequently established in areas of extensive forest (hence the term forest glass). For example, the documents of the forest glassworks of Spiegelberg in the Swabian-Franconian Forest, which was in operation from 1705 to 1822, had an annual demand for potash of approximately 800 centners. Because one cubic metre of wood (750 kg) only produced 1 kg of potash, this glassworks thus needed around 40,000 cubic metres of wood per year. Even today the names of some settlements still recall the former potash works. For example, two hamlets in the municipality of Mainhardt, Germany, are called Aschenhütte.",

    "text": "The Jämthund, also called the Swedish Elkhound, is a breed of dog of the Spitz type that is found in Northern Europe. The Jämthund is eponymous with Jämtland, a province in the middle of Sweden. History\nThe Jämthund is one of a number of breeds of spitz-type hunting dogs that have been known throughout Scandinavia for centuries. Historically these dogs have been used to hunt a wide variety of game including bear, elk, wolf and lynx. The Jämthund received official recognition as a breed in 1946, due to intensive work by Aksel Lindström and others. Before that, both it and the Norwegian Elkhound were seen as the same breed. They are both used for hunting large game, such as moose and bear. Lineage\nThe breed falls under the mitochondrial DNA sub-clade referred to as d1 that is only found in northern Scandinavia. It is the result of a male dog-female wolf hybridization that occurred post-domestication. Subclade d1 that is thought to have originated  no more than 480 3,000 years ago  and it includes all Sámi-related breeds: Finnish Lapphund, Swedish Lapphund, Lapponian Herder, Swedish Elkhound, Norwegian Elkhound, Black Norwegian Elkhound and Hällefors Elkhound.",

    "text": "The maternal wolf sequence that contributed to these breeds has not been matched across Eurasia. Description\nAppearance\nThe dog should have a loosely curled tail that hangs on the back and is not too thin or too tightly curled; when relaxed the tail should hang straight down. This breed has erect ears with a wide space in between them, a medium to long muzzle, and a double coat of various shades of agouti. The eyes are brown. The size of the male is usually 57 65 centimetres (22 26 in), weighing 30 35 kilograms (66 77 lb). Females are usually between 52 60 centimetres (20 24 in), weighing 25 30 kilograms (55 66 lb). The Jämthund should be distinguished from the Norwegian Elkhound. The Norwegian Elkhound is much shorter and stockier than the Jämthund, and its tail shape is very different. It also has a black mask on the muzzle, whereas the Jämthund has a white muzzle, white cheeks and typical wolf markings. Temperament\nAlthough calm and affectionate with its family, the Jämthund can be dominant with other dogs and has a strong prey drive. A truly all-around canine, it can go from a hunting trip and back to the family hearth with great aplomb.",

Born in Scotland, McKerrell moved to South Africa to work as a coal miner with his brother David, although he left around the onset of the Second Boer War. He returned to Scotland, settling in Kilmarnock, where he married in 1899, and joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP) around this time. He was elected as a councillor in Kilmarnock, and also became a bailie there. He was appointed as agent of the Ayrshire Miners' Union, and through this served on the executive of both the Scottish Miners' Federation and the Miners' Federation of Great Britain; and as vice-chairman of the Scottish Trades Union Congress. The ILP was affiliated to the Labour Party, and McKerrell was selected to stand for Labour in Midlothian at the January 1910 general election. However, he withdrew from the contest at short notice. In November 1910, he was adopted as a last-minute candidate for Liverpool Kirkdale at the December general election, taking 41.6  of the vote, a small reduction for the party's performance earlier in the year.",

McKerrell next stood in the 1911 Kilmarnock Burghs by-election where, as a supporter of women's suffrage, he received significant support from the local branches of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. Despite this, he could take only third place, with 17.3  of the votes cast. McKerrell's brother, David, had returned to mine in South Africa, and became a leader of a strike in the early 1910s. As a result, he was deported back to Scotland, where he stayed with Tom and briefly became a prominent speaker, but died soon after. McKerrell was a supporter of British involvement in World War I, although he opposed conscription, and in 1917 he resigned his union posts to become an official in the Ministry of Labour. This required him to move to London, while his wife remained in Kilmarnock; the two drifted apart, and in 1921, McKerrell asked for a separation. He appeared to regret this decision, and was lined up for a move to the Ministry's Scottish office, but his wife would not take him back.",

First appearing in  Kids These Days , the pilot episode of Star Trek: Starfleet Academy, Nahla is introduced as a former Starfleet captain who resigned from the United Federation of Planets after following the law over her own conscience and ruling to separate a mother from her young son. Fifteen years later, she is recruited to become Chancellor of the newly-recommissioned Starfleet Academy. She is a Lanthanite Human hybrid, and the first Lanthanite main character in a Star Trek series. The character has been well-received by critics, who praised her unique personality and physicality which contrasts with that of previous Star Trek captains, as well as Hunter's performance. Fictional character biography\nSeason 1\nIn 3180 on the Federation outpost Pikaru, Ake is the commanding officer and holds a hearing for pirate Nus Braka, Anisha Mir, and her young son Caleb. In order to avoid starvation, Anisha reveals that she struck a deal with Braka to help him steal food rations from a Federation supply vessel, but became implicated as his accomplice when he murdered the pilot. Ake sentences Braka to a penal colony and Anisha to a rehabilitation camp, telling her that Caleb will be taken as a ward of the Federation.

The character's name was revealed on July 28, 2025 alongside the roles of the rest of the main cast during the Star Trek universe panel at San Diego Comic-Con. Discussing her casting, Hunter stated that she approached Landau and Kurtzman after being offered the role with thoughts about how the character should behave, explaining that  I had ideas about Nahla being more of a fluid creature. Somebody who was like liquid, like water,  and adding that she wanted her movements to be  feline  and  tactile .

We also knew we wanted her to be quirky because she s over 420 years old and sort of come to the point in her long, long life where she decides that she no longer wants to wear shoes around the starship. Hunter later spoke about how she tended to avoid projects that push certain messages, but that she was drawn to Starfleet Academy ethos of imparting empathy. Characterization\nKurtzman noted that the character contains multitudes, and that casting Hunter allowed them to  take extraordinary risks that you might not be able to take with an actor who couldn t pull that off . He explained,  the character is over 415 years old, so she s lived an enormous amount of life. That affords her a unique perspective on everything. And because she was a mother and she lost a child, it gives her a unique perspective on what it means to raise the kids of Starfleet Academy, which also qualifies her to be a great chancellor.

Ake is a half human and half Lanthanite, a long-lived species originally introduced in the second season of Star Trek: Strange New Worlds. The only other Lanthanite in the franchise is Pelia, who is portrayed by Carol Kane. Reviewers noted that the decision for Ake to be part Lanthanite was likely made so that the character could have lived hundreds of years by the start of the show, and would be able to remember the original Federation and Starfleet prior to The Burn, offering her a unique perspective as one of the only living characters to have attended the original Starfleet Academy. Hunter felt it was important to exhibit Ake's age through the way she interacts with the world, particularly through her physicality, explaining that  how could that manifest in a different way that would not just be flouting protocol because oh, I m a rebel?

Reception\nThe character, and Hunter's portrayal, has received generally positive reviews from critics. Lacy Braugher of Den of Geek wrote that,  Hunter is great, deftly holding a multitude of tensions simultaneously within her performance. Effortlessly shifting between gravitas, an almost painful sincerity, and a certain kind of playful oddness, she serves multiple roles within the world of Starfleet Academy, much like the ship she captains , and declared Nahla  one of the most intriguing new characters that Star Trek has introduced in quite some time .

By 1933, Ambo had started to be a recreation place with the construction of some bath cabins with cisterns of concrete, and a couple of European-type hotels, as well as simple villas for the Emperor and important persons. By 1938, the Guida dell'A.O.I. described improvements to Ambo which included a post office, telephone service, a clinic for outpatients, restaurants, and a projected hotel. Two Italian forts were constructed, and in a cave the Italians had erected a monument for casualties of the Pusteria Division. The approach to Ambo was still over an old bridge, and below it a natural bridge used by caravans. When the Allies reached Ambo with a South African armored car patrol in early 1941, they had to evacuate 140  utterly panicked Italians . The British operated an improvised camp for prisoners-of-war at Ambo until 1942. At least as early as 1955, there was a 170 kW hydro-electric power station in the town; by 1965 the installed electrical capacity was 210 kVA, with annual production of 132,000 kWh. In 1958 Ambo was one of 27 places in Ethiopia ranked as First Class Township.",

A light earth tremor was felt in the evening of 23 January 1968; its epicenter was somewhere near Ambo but no damage occurred. In the last weeks of the Ethiopian Civil War, military units of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front captured Ambo on 25 April 1991 from the disintegrating units of the Derg. This was part of their strategy to avoid a direct assault on the capital, Addis Ababa, and instead surround the city and isolate it from the rest of the country. A prominent Oromo businessman, Daraaraa Kafani, was murdered in front of his home; eyewitnesses said he was slain by a man wearing a military uniform. His funeral was attended by thousands of Oromos in Ambo; police arrested more than 37 people, stating that they were supporters of the Oromo Liberation Front on 3 September. In the following February, 70 year old Oromo elder Dandana Gurmu was arrested on the accusation that he was a supporter of the OLF. On 24 April 2003, a Tigrayan student was shot and killed and two others injured in a clash between Oromo and Tigrayan students at the Ambo Agricultural College.",

The Komediant is a documentary about the Burstein family   Yiddish vaudeville artists   Mike Burstein (stage name Mike Burstyn), his parents and twin sister   and touches on the history of Yiddish theater. Goldfinger worked on this film for four years and in May 2000 the film was released theatrically in Israel, becoming the first documentary film in years that was commercially released. The film was widely acclaimed and Goldfinger was chosen by the mainstream daily Yedioth Ahronoth as one of the top five people in cinema that year. In 2002  The Komediant  was theatrically released in the US. It was distributed by New Yorker Films and screened at over 50 cinemas nationwide, including Lincoln Plaza in New York City and at dozens of film festivals. The Chicago Film Critics dubbed the film one of the year's top five documentaries. In 2011 Goldfinger's second full-length film was released.

The freighter was delivered to the Navy at Montreal, Quebec, Canada, on 21 September 1918 and was placed in commission the following day for service in the Naval Overseas Transportation Service. Aries was named for the constellation. After fitting out, the freighter sailed for France late in October and arrived at St. Nazaire on 11 November, the day Germany signed the armistice ending the fighting of World War I. Lake Geneva was then assigned to European waters. Based at Cardiff, Wales, she carried coal from that port and from Belfast, Ireland, to French ports. After continuing this duty through the spring of 1919, she sailed for Charleston, South Carolina, carrying some 1,500 tons of Army ordnance material. However, while en route to that port, she was diverted to Newport News, Virginia, where she arrived on 12 July. Between the wars\nAfter discharging her cargo, Lake Geneva was slated for demobilization.",

After a series of sea trials, the ship got underway on 6 September, bound for Pearl Harbor and arrived there on the 18th. She was drydocked briefly for the installation of a new propeller before sailing for the South Pacific on 6 October. Aries reached Manus in the Admiralty Islands, on 28 October and commenced provisioning warships of the 3rd Fleet. The ship was damaged there by the November 1944 USS Mount Hood (AE-11) explosion.

FPA is the study of the management of external relations and activities of state. Foreign policy involves goals, strategies, measures, management methods, guidelines, directives, agreements, and so on. National governments may conduct international relations not only with other nation-states but also with international organizations and non-governmental organizations. Managing foreign relations need carefully considered plans of actions that are adapted to foreign interests and concerns of the government. Study\nForeign policy analysis (FPA) involves the study of how a state makes foreign policy. As it analyzes the decision making process, FPA involves the study of both international and domestic politics. FPA also draws upon the study of diplomacy, war, intergovernmental organizations, and economic sanctions, each of which are means by which a state may implement foreign policy. In academia, FPA is most commonly taught within the discipline of public policy within political science or political studies, and the study of international relations. FPA can also be considered a sub-field of the study of international relations (IR), which aims to understand the processes behind foreign policy decision making. The most prominent scholars in this field of study include Richard Snyder, James Rosenau, Alexander George, Graham Allison and Irving Janis.",

    "text": "The most prominent scholars in this field of study include Richard Snyder, James Rosenau, Alexander George, Graham Allison and Irving Janis. According to foreignpolicyanalysis.org,  As a field of study, FPA is characterized by its actor-specific focus. In the simplest terms, it is the study of the process, effects, causes, or outputs of foreign policy decision-making in either a comparative or case-specific manner. The underlying and often implicit argument theorizes that human beings, acting as a group or within a group, compose and cause change in international politics. In other words, FPA can be understood as a critique of the dominant structuralist approaches in IR. Stages in decision making\nThe making of foreign policy involves a number of stages:\nAssessment of the international and domestic political environment - Foreign policy is made and implemented within an international and domestic political context, which must be understood by a state in order to determine the best foreign policy option. For example, a state may need to respond to an international crisis. Goal setting - A state has multiple foreign policy goals. A state must determine which goal is affected by the international and domestic political environment at any given time. In addition, foreign policy goals may conflict, which will require the state to prioritize. Determination of policy options - A state must then determine what policy options are available to meet the goal or goals set in light of the political environment.",

Determination of policy options - A state must then determine what policy options are available to meet the goal or goals set in light of the political environment. This will involve an assessment of the state's capacity implement policy options and an assessment of the consequences of each policy option. Formal decision making action - A formal foreign policy decision will be taken at some level within a government. Foreign policy decisions are usually made by the executive branch of government. Common governmental actors or institutions which make foreign policy decisions include: the head of state (such as a president) or head of government (such as a prime minister), cabinet, or minister. Implementation of chosen policy option - Once a foreign policy option has been chosen, and a formal decision has been made, then the policy must be implemented. Foreign policy is most commonly implemented by specialist foreign policy arms of the state bureaucracy, such as a Ministry of Foreign Affairs or State Department. Other departments may also have a role in implementing foreign policy, such as departments for: trade, defence, and aid. Key approaches\n(as put forward by Graham T. Allison in 1969.

    "text": "Allison in 1969. For a more comprehensive description see his Book Essence of Decision 1971 1999)\nRational actor model\nThe rational actor model is based on rational choice theory. The model adopts the state as the primary unit of analysis, and inter-state relations (or international relations) as the context for analysis. The state is seen as a monolithic unitary actor, capable of making rational decisions based on preference ranking and value maximization. According to the rational actor model, a rational decision making process is used by a state. This process includes:\nGoal setting and ranking. Consideration of options. Assessment of consequences. Profit maximization. In other words, it provides models for answering the question: with that information what would be the best decision for reaching one's goal? In this theory, the underlying assumption is that governments are unified and rational, in this manner, they would seek for carefully planned and well-defined foreign policy goals. In this sense, rational choice model is primarily a realist perspective of foreign policy level of analysis. The rational actor model has been subject to criticism. The model tends to neglect a range of political variables, of which Michael Clarke includes:  political decisions, non-political decisions, bureaucratic procedures, continuations of previous policy, and sheer accident. It also ignores emotions, emotional flooding, selective attention, and groupthink. Governmental Bargaining Model\nIn this model the state is not seen as a monolithic unitary actor.",

Instead it is a collection of different bureaucracies vying for increasing their funding and size. Individual decision makers try to bargain and compete for influence with their own particular goal in mind. Things are often viewed as a zero-sum game where one bureaucracy's  win  or increasing their level of funding is seen as a loss for another bureaucracy. Here decisions are made by bureaucracies competing against each other and suggesting solutions to problems that would involve using their resources so as to increase their level of importance. Bureaucratic politics model, in keeping with its pluralistic connotation, can also refer to that inner state processes including no institutional actors, who with their informal channels would affect policy results. Organizational Process Model\nOrganizational Processes model emerges from clusters of governmental organizations that look after their own best interests and follow 'standard operating procedures'. In this model different bureaucracies have different standard operating procedures. These procedures are made in order to allow day-to-day operations to be carried out. Often an order or decision will have to work around these standard procedures. It is often exceedingly difficult for a bureaucracy to do something  out of character  or contrary to their standard procedures.",

    "text": "Glove stretcher is a 19th century device for  easing  (stretching) the gloves. The rounded tips of the stretchers, typically made of two wooden pieces hinged in the middle and spring-loaded, were placed inside the fingers of a glove. The handles were then squeezed so the fingers were stretched, allowing the glove to be put on without damaging it. The scissors-like implements were also made from metal and celluloid. History\nGlove stretchers were popular in the Victorian era. Kid leather was considered to be the best material for gloves worn by a proper Victorian lady, as cotton and silk were easily stretchable, thus revealing the imperfections of a hand. The leather of a young goat was essential to emulate the desired appearance of a hand with tapered fingertips. The scissor-like stretchers were helping to preserve the shape of the glove fingers after washing. A 1908 advice on washing the chamois gloves suggests using the stretcher as an alternative to washing and drying the gloves on hands. In the 19th century the stretchers were widespread, every  good  shop or household was expected to have one. In the 21st century the original device resembling the scissors is largely forgotten. Haglund reports that while playing a version of the Kim's game, children are no longer able to guess the purpose of the implement. References\nSources\nNational Coal Mining Museum (2021).

    "text": "The Uniform Monday Holiday Act (Pub. L. 90 363, 82 Stat. 250, enacted June 28, 1968) is an Act of Congress that permanently moved two federal holidays in the United States to a Monday, being Washington's Birthday and Memorial Day, and further made Columbus Day a federal holiday, also permanently on a Monday. This created long weekends with three days off ending with the holidays, such as Memorial Day Weekend. Veterans Day was moved from November 11 to the fourth Monday in October, but in 1978, it was returned to November 11, the actual date of the end of World War I and celebrated in several European countries as Armistice Day. The Act was signed into law on June 1, 1968, and took effect on January 1, 1971. Background\nThe Act was designed to increase the number of long weekends for federal employees, a favorite goal of the travel industry. Veterans Day was removed from this list of  always-on-Monday  holidays when it was moved back to its traditional date of November 11, by act of Congress in 1975, effective 1978. This Act did not officially change the name of Washington's Birthday to Presidents Day, nor did it combine Washington's Birthday with Lincoln's Birthday, despite suggestions that those two changes be made. Many US states have adopted some version of the Presidents Day name.",

Many US states have adopted some version of the Presidents Day name. The perception that the name was changed stems from the fact that the act placed federal observance of Washington's Birthday in the week of February 15 to 21 and, since that week always falls between Lincoln's birthday (February 12) and Washington's (February 22), but never includes either date, popular references have given rise to the title, which recognizes both Presidents. As of 1998, a dozen U.S. states officially refer to the holiday as  Presidents' Day. Lincoln's Birthday holiday with very limited exceptions is no longer observed at all, at least on its actual date, though some states combine it with Washington's Birthday. Though the holiday was not in existence at the time, Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, which was established in 1983 and first observed in 1986, is celebrated on the third Monday in January, which falls on January 15 21, instead of King's actual birth date, January 15, for the same reasons.",

Hadad was born in Chetumal, Quintana Roo, Mexico and currently lives in Mexico City. Of Mayan and Lebanese heritage, growing up near the Belize border and able to hear Caribbean radio stations coming from Cuba has been hugely influential on her heterogeneous perspective on social and cultural national life. Coupled with that, her incessant desire to critique the powers that be, her background as a political science major in college, her ongoing explorations in non-traditional theatrical forms, is all that fuels Hadad's unique political cabaret performances. As Roselyn Constantino has written,   o ut of Hadad s meditations on the multiplicity of influences shaping her and other Mexican's  sic  sense of themselves, and on the violence implicity  sic  in that process, emerge performances featuring a fast-paced, fragmented, parodic unveiling of traditional Mexican song, dress, and dance. Hadad avails herself of the humorous sociopolitical criticism of cabaret, carpa, and teatro de revista important theatrical styles in Mexican cultural history.",

Education\nBefore moving to Mexico City to attend the National Autonomous University of Mexico's Theatre School (Centro Universitario de Teatro), Hadad was enrolled at the Universidad Veracruzana where she was a political science and journalism major. Early career\nAfter appearing in a number of theatrical shows, she came to the fore in 1985 in Donna Giovanni, an all-female adaptation of Mozart's opera, which was directed by Jesusa Rodríguez and became a hit in Europe. It closed after its 500th performance, in the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City. Also in the 1980s, a major television appearance was her role as Margarita in the Televisa-produced telenovela Teresa (1989), which starred fellow Mexican Lebanese actor Salma Hayek. In the early 1990s, Hadad was cast in the role of Teresa de Teresa in Alfonso Cuarón's first full-feature film, Sólo con tu pareja (Only With Your Partner), a film that, although lighthearted and comedic, includes AIDS in its story, something not openly discussed in the Mexican public sphere at that time.",

Early political cabaret performances and influences\nHadad's initial explorations into political cabaret were a result of the freedom she found within earlier forms of cabaret, both in form (due to its playfulness and mixture of music, voice singing, and theater) and content (sexual permissiveness and political satire). But it was not about reproducing European modes of cabaret, Hadad was also interested in Mexican popular theater (teatro de carpa and teatro de revista), humor, and style to begin to create her particular mode of political cabaret. Some of her early political cabaret shows included: Nostalgia Arrabalera and Del Rancho a la Ciudad.",

Due to the interest and use of ranchera music in these, led to Hadad to produce and star in the tragicomic musical La Occisa or Luz, Levántate y Lucha based on the life of Mexican singer Lucha Reyes (1904-1944), a relatively famous ranchera singer, but who had gone into obscurity by the second half of the twentieth century. Hadad began to claim Reyes as the one who initiated the canto bravío (what later became ranchera music) in Mexico, but has not received this credit. Hadad states in an interview in 1997  traditionally women would sing the campirana song or bucolic songs with soft voices, with very high pitch. Women did not use the same force in singing compared to a man and Lucha (Reyes) is the one who initiates this type of ranchera singing in a bravía way among women. Because of that she changed the vernacular song . In addition to ranchera music, cabaret, teatro de carpa, and teatro de revista, films from the so-called golden age of Mexican cinema, especially the rumbera whose plots were set primarily in urban cabarets, were also highly influential in Hadad's visual and highly dramatic language.",

Notable political cabaret performances\nOut of the production La Occisa or Luz, Levántate y Lucha came Hadad's collaboration with the musical group that has accompanied her since, Los Tarzanes. Together, they have created various performances (La Mujer Ladrina, Apocalipsis Ranchero, La Mujer del Golfo, etc.). In her Heavy Nopal show, Astrid makes use of iconic references, not just as scenery (the cactus, the rock, the pyramid, the tequila bottle), but also on her own body, becoming not only the stage, but also an altar.

Of course, all this seasoned with a loud wardrobe, where hearts, gigantic eyes, turquoise-blue dresses and an old lantern, among others, play before the eyes of the audience. In Sol y Sombra, taking as an inspiration the novel Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Astrid presents a show where, setting the forces of evil against those of goodness, she leads us to reflect on (through her sense of humor) our inner ghosts as well as on the joys of life. This show boasts a colorful wardrobe and scenery, in which the use of  papel picado  is an important stage element.

The Traitor (Passe-Partout): The traitor who accidentally leads the authorities to the abandoned warehouse where their stash of cigarettes is hidden, and who betrays Tarzan by telling the police that Tarzan crossed the US-Canada border the day a border-control officer was killed. It is revealed during his interrogation that his real name is René Langlois, and that he joined the group to provide food for his mother, because his father is an alcoholic who spends his salary on drinking.",

He has a sexual interest in Ciboulette, which complicates his relationship with Tarzan, as Tarzan is also in love with her. He is often seen as a realist in the play as he is the only one in the group that knows he is a criminal. The Unimportant Guy (Tit-Noir): The group's accountant. It is revealed during his interrogation that his real name is Arsène Larue, and that he joined the group to obtain money for his future family and to study to become a priest. His nickname is  Tit-Noir  because when he was little, he had black hair, so his father called him  Petit-Noir , which eventually became  Tit-Noir . Tit-Noir serves a function similar to the messenger in Greek tragedy. The 'Somewhat Slightly Less Intelligent' (Moineau): At the age of 20, he is the most artistic of the group. He often plays the harmonica, and joined the group so that he could become a musician. His name comes from the French word for sparrow, a humorous way of calling him a featherbrain. His lack of intelligence is clearly shown several times throughout.",

The Old, Experienced Policeman (Chief Policeman): Only seen during the second act, when he interrogates the group. He cleverly causes every member to reveal something they did not intend to. He has a son around the age of Tarzan, which makes it harder for him to send him to jail. The New Guy  Policeman (Ledoux): The detective who follows Passe-Partout to the hideout. The Stereotypical Guard (Roger): A police officer who is present during the interrogations, and who shoots Tarzan, resulting in his death at the end of the play. Summary\nTarzan assembles a group of teenagers who, under the stress of their familial or economic situations, agree to sell cigarettes smuggled into Canada from the United States. Ciboulette, the youngest of the group and the only female, is in love with Tarzan, but does not reveal this despite Tit-Noir's urging, as she is worried it will ruin the business.

While the others wait for Tarzan to return, Passe-Partout attempts to supplant as the gang's leader, and disobeys Tarzan's instructions by stealing a wallet from a passerby, who is actually a detective, Ledoux. Tarzan returns to the hideout but Ledoux arrives at the gang's hideout and arrests the teenagers with a police brigade. The second act begins in the police station's interrogation room. Each member is questioned individually. During the interrogations, the police receive a call informing them that a border patrol guard was murdered earlier that day. The police chief interrogates Passe-Partout, who reveals that Tarzan had crossed the border that day. Under the impression that the other gang members have betrayed him, Tarzan confesses to the murder of the border guard. In the third act, the group talks about what they will do to Tarzan at the prison, and how they will execute him. Later on, it is seen on the news that Tarzan has escaped from prison. He goes straight to the  Hangar  where they keep the cigarettes. The police had cleaned it out, so there was no longer anything and it was empty.

He stays with Ciboulette until the cops come to get him and when he is shot, Ciboulette whispers things to him and holds him close. Inspiration\nDubé based Zone in part on a past experience illegally crossing the Canada US border. Analysis\nZone takes place in a  squalid  environment, familiar territory for Dubé, whose works often dealt with the social disorder in French Canada at that time. The characters in Zone, trapped within the poverty of their social milieu, resort to  adolescent ideals  in an attempt to escape. Laroche suggests that the teenaged gang members are play-acting as the characters they saw in films. Dubé's characters reveal their deepest thoughts and feelings in their dialogue, reflecting their underlying helplessness. The irony is that the gang, who began engaging in criminal activities to escape the societal  grey zone  they inhabit, are ultimately punished by the same society that offered them no support.",

It also deals with the complicated romantic relationship between a 21-year-old man, Tarzan; and a 16-year-old girl, Ciboulette. Reception\nEdwin Hamblet criticized Zone for its  sudden and perfunctory  conclusion, finding that  Dubé tends to have trouble in ending his plays  and citing the artificiality of the plot twists. In 1953, Zone was awarded the Grand Prix for the best Canadian play at the Victoria National Drama Festival. Zone also won the Calvert, Sir Barry Jackson and Louis Jouvet prizes.

List\nBelow is a list of some names used by Sikhs for God:\nMeaning and usage\nThe various names for God in Sikhism may stem from either the Indic traditions or the Islamic one. Others are unique to the Sikh tradition, such as Waheguru, Akal Purakh, and Sarabloh. Employment of these terms does not mean Sikhs accept the religious context in which they are understood in their original sources. For example, the meaning of the words Hari or Ram as used by Sikhs does not mean the same thing as these terms do in the Hindu (particularity Vaishnav) traditions. Usage of these names does not mean Sikhs conceptualize their concept of God in the form of the incarnated devas or devis from Indic mythology, but rather they are used to describe various aspects of God as per Sikh theology. The Sikh gurus adopted the names for the divine from various faith systems as they saw these sectarian differences in linguistics as unimportant in-comparison to the actual message they were trying to spread. On page 64 of the Guru Granth Sahib, various Islamicate terms for God are also presented freely. Your names are countless.",

It was an important town in the history of Central Asia, situated on the borders of settled and agricultural civilizations. It was the center of a great oasis and political district, commanding a key point connecting Kazakhstan with China, Europe, the Middle East, Siberia and Ural. Names\nThe first known state in the region was known to Chinese scholars as Kangju, which was centered on the Syr Darya (also known as the Kang River). Kangju existed from the 1st century BC until the 5th century AD. Its capital was reportedly at or near Bityan. After being subject to several different waves of invaders, Kangju collapsed into several independent states situated mainly in the Syr Darya valley and its tributaries of Keles and Atysi. There are records that portray the determination of earlier names of Farab. It is thought that a group of coins collected in Otrar and some towns of the oasis date back to the time of these records.",

There is a generic symbol of the Turgeshi in the form of a bow on the obverse of such coins and the image of a lion on the reverse side. On a second type of coin, there is an  X  sign on the reverse side; these may originate from the mint of a local ruler. There is a suggestion that the coins of the second type were minted by rulers of the Turkic state of Kangu Tarban, the population of which were the Kangars. According to the coins, in the 6th to 8th centuries, Kangu Tarban was ruled by a local dynasty of the Kangars, and their capital became a Tarban town named Turarband that was later to be called Otrar. Since the times of the golden hordes, the ruins of Otrar have been attractive because of rumours about the treasures of the ancient rulers, and about buried piles of gold coins and jewelry. The source of such legends was perhaps confirmed by the archaeological finds of various coins and jewelry.

In 1218, a Mongolian trade caravan of around 450 men arrived in Otrar, including an ambassador of Genghis Khan. The governor of Otrar, Inalchuq, who was an uncle of Sultan Muhammad II of the Khwarazmian Empire accused them of being Mongolian spies and arrested them, and with the assent of Sultan Muhammed, executed the entire caravan. Genghis Khan responded by sending a delegation of three diplomats to Sultan Muhammad, demanding Inalchuq be punished; but Muhammad responded by beheading the Muslim ambassador and shaving off the beards of his two Mongol companions, provoking Genghis Khan into a retaliatory invasion. He besieged Otrar for five months in 1219, eventually breaching its walls and executing Inalchuq along with massacring the inhabitants.

    "text": "The Lewis Overthrust is a geologic thrust fault structure of the Rocky Mountains found within the bordering national parks of Glacier in Montana, United States and Waterton Lakes in Alberta, Canada. The structure was created due to the collision of tectonic plates about 59-75 million years ago that drove a several mile thick wedge of Precambrian rock 50 mi (80 km) eastwards, causing it to overlie softer Cretaceous age rock that is 1300 to 1400 million years younger. The décollement can be seen from Marias Pass as a thin tan line of rock roughly halfway up Summit Mountain and Little Dog Mountain. Geography\nThe Canadian Rocky Mountain foreland thrust and fold belt is a northeastward tapering deformational belt consisting of Mesoproterozoic, Paleozoic, and Mesozoic strata. The Lewis thrust sheet is one of the major structures of the foreland thrust and fold belt extending over 280 mi (450 km) from Mount Kidd near Calgary, AB in the Southeast Canadian Cordillera to Steamboat Mountain, located west of Great Falls, Northwest Montana in the United States. The Lewis overthrust provides scientific insight into geologic processes happening in other parts of the world, like the Andes and the Himalaya Mountains.",

Geology and tectonics\nTectonic initiation and the Canadian Cordillera\nThe onset of Cordilleran orogenesis began in the Middle Jurassic time, as a result of the breakup of Pangea and North American plate motion toward subduction zones at the western margin. Most of the Canadian Cordillera today consists of numerous tectonostratigraphic terranes that were accreted to the stable margin of North America from the Jurassic to Early Tertiary as a result of eastward and northward drifting island arcs that collided with the continental lithosphere of North America. These terranes were accreted due to upper-crustal rocks being detached from the denser lower-crustal and proto-Pacific upper mantle lithosphere that was subducted under the North American craton. The allochthonous upper crustal terranes were juxtaposed over top of each other and over the western margin of the North American craton along a system of interconnected, northeast and southwest verging major thrust faults. Rise of the Rockies and formation of the Rocky Mountain Thrust and Fold Belt\nThe onset of deformation of the Rocky Mountain fold and thrust belt was due to collisional tectonic forces that occurred on the west edge of the North American craton.",

A profound unconformity separates the sedimentary cover from the Archean to Paleoproterozoic crystalline crust of North America. This thrust and fold belt has a thin skinned geometry as indicated by the array of thrust faults that interleave and overlap along strike and cut across strata at low to moderate angle that flatten with depth, repeat the same Cambrian to Triassic stratigraphy from thrust sheet to thrust sheet, and merge into a common basal décollement, the Rocky Mountain basal décollement. The Rocky Mountain thrust and fold belt propagated from west to east, accommodating up to 120 mi (200 km) of horizontal shortening near the Canada and US border, and about 43 mi (70 km) in northern parts of BC and Montana. The eastern boundary of the fold and thrust belt is marked by the easternmost deformed strata known in outcrop and or in the subsurface.

On the west side, the Rocky Mountains are bounded by the Rocky Mountain Trench, where the trench is interpreted to overlie the western, down-dropped blocks of major normal faults that separate the southern Rocky Mountains from the Purcell mountains. Horizontal shortening of the thin-skinned sediments lying above the detachment fault due to tectonic convergence must accommodate this horizontal shortening and has done so by the formation of major thrust faults with large displacement, the largest of which is the Lewis Thrust. The thrust sheets involved in the Canadian Rocky Mountain foreland thrust and fold belt consist of different aged strata indicative of significant deformation over time. The dominant structure of the deformational belt is a series of thrust faults, which are mostly listric and north-easterly or easterly verging. These thrust faults follow long bedding parallel detachments separated by ramps. As a result, a series of overlying thrust sheets is produced that follow their associated fault detachments. In addition, there is a westward dipping basal detachment that extends into the Cordilleran metamorphic core at mid-crustal levels.",

Lewis thrust system\nThe Lewis thrust Is a low-angle thrust fault in which Precambrian sediments have been thrust over younger Cretaceous sediments. The thrust sheet is constrained by lateral ramps on either side. In the south this occurs near Marias Pass, Montana, where the ramp geometry is parallel to the direction of sheet movement. In the north, the thrust sheet is forced up and over an oblique ramp near the Kootenay Pass region in British Columbia. The overall shape of the thrust sheet as it moved north-eastward has a general convex shape towards the foreland. The Lewis sheet is carried by the Lewis thrust fault where the compression and thrusting (in the southern Canadian Rocky Mountains Foothills and Eastern Front ranges) was associated with oblique, right-hand convergence between the Intermontane terrane and the North American craton. This transpression in the Late Cretaceous led to the tectonic inversion of the Cordilleran miogeocline and the Belt-Purcell basin as the Lewis sheet began to buckle and fold, where strata was then overturned until a break or fault was formed.",

Similarly, the thick succession of Mesoproterozoic strata consisting of the Belt-Purcell supergroup followed the same sequence of events leading to the structural culmination seen in the southern end of the Purcell anticlinorium. The Lewis thrust is cut by two major extensional fault systems, the Flathead fault and the Rocky Mountain trench fault system. Both of which are late Eocene to Miocene in age. However, the amount of shortening that has taken place on the thrust is not connected to Eocene extension due to the Rocky Mountain trench fault system and the Flathead fault having no influence positionally on the footwall and hanging wall cutoffs of the Lewis thrust. Instead, this transpression was replaced with transtension in the early Eocene involving east west crustal extension and tectonic exhumation, which brought up mid-crustal metamorphic rocks to the surface to be exposed. Additionally, this transition from transpression to transtension resulted in rapid cooling of the metamorphic core complexes as they were exhumed and brought to the surface.",

This leads to the basal décollement being exposed and the association with north south faulting, dyke emplacement, and voluminous magmatism, which in turn, marked cessation of crustal shortening. Paleotemperatures and geothermal gradients indicate that the Lewis thrust sheet was 7.5 8.4 mi (12 13.5 km) thick when thrusting commenced. Duplexes\nThrust faults often associate three types of structures, imbricate fan structures, ramp-flat structures, and duplex structures, all of which are seen within the Lewis thrust and the Rocky Mountain thrust and fold belt. Duplex structures are common and have been located in numerous locations along the Lewis thrust. These structures are distinct due to their structurally overlapping, lenticular stacked thrust fault slices. A prime example is seen in an area that extends from the Kootenay Pass north of the border to Marias Pass found in Montana.",

Two windows in this section showing exposures of Upper Cretaceous strata exposed beneath the Lewis Thrust occur adjacent to the Flathead Fault. Within these windows, the Lewis thrust is folded along with overlying and underlying strata in a series of northwest-trending anticlinal culminations that extend the length of the west side of the salient. Furthermore, two distinct structural levels can be seen in this section, an upper level comprising the majority of the mass of the Lewis thrust sheet which is characterized by broad open folds in relatively undeformed rocks, and a fairly thin lower level consisting of stacked imbricate, southwest-facing, sigmoidal thrust fault slices, bounded below by the Lewis thrust, and above by a separate bedding-parallel thrust called the Tombstone thrust.

Erosion over time has shaped the mountains into their characteristic shape, where they tower over the associated prairies. Geochronology\nThe fault motion of the Lewis thrust is dated based on the oldest age for motion being defined by the youngest sediments on the footwall, which are said to be about 65 million years old. Fission track analysis of Uranium-bearing minerals such as Zircons and Apatite which involves dating the radioactive uranium found in sediments along the Lewis thrust using isotopic ratios of Uranium provides constraints of the late pre-deformational paleogeothermal gradient and thickness of the Lewis sheet. This data, after being calibrated into geologic ages, led to the conclusion that maximum burial and heating in the Lewis thrust occurred during the Campanian over a time interval of less than 15 million years prior to the start of movement of the thrust sheet.",

This is supported by locations further south along the thrust fault in Montana where faults on the leading edge cut through a 76 Ma volcanic marker proving that the onset of fault movement must be younger than 76 Ma. The Youngest movement along the fault or in other words, the end of movement for thrust movement is based on the stratigraphic and structural characteristics of early Eocene deposits and is limited by the age of normal faults that cut the thrust and the associated sediments found within these normal faults. Additionally, The cooling of the metamorphic core complexes that arose and were exhumed is said to mark the end of deformation of the thrust belt which was done by using radiometric Uranium in zircons to provide a cooling age that is consistent with tectonic transition from compression to extension. U-Pb dating of zircons from various deformed and crosscutting mid-crustal granitic rocks in south-central British Columbia provided cooling ages of 59 Ma.",

Furthermore, the transition from thrusting and folding to crustal stretching led to rapid cooling of the Priest River metamorphic core complexes where cooling ages found in biotite gave ages of  55 Ma through K-Ar and 40Ar 39Ar dating methods. In addition, the same faults in Montana that cut a volcanic marker were also found to be cut by 59 Ma porphyry dikes. This limits the youngest age for movement to have occurred at 59 Ma. Together, dates revealed for oldest and youngest movement along the fault place the overall movement of the Lewis thrust fault to have occurred over a span of about 15 Ma in the Late Cretaceous to Early Paleocene periods between 75 and 59 Ma. Paleotemperatures have been derived from vitrinite reflectance by measure of the percentage of incident light reflected from the surface of vitrinite particles in a sedimentary rock from the Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous formation along the Lewis thrust.

Geologic movement\nGeophysical methods in the form of seismic analysis has also been used to determine movement along the thrust sheet. In one study, seismic data recorded along the 49 N parallel (the border between Canada and the US) was recorded from the Rocky Mountain trench fault in the foreland belt to the east flank of the Moyie anticline of the Purcell anticlinorium, which is thought to be the location where the Lewis fault tapers off. Seismic data produced showed total displacement of 115 km of the Lewis thrust sheet. This was done by locating the position of the footwall cutoff of the Lewis sheet which is interpreted in the seismic section as truncated reflectors at 11 15 km depth underlying the Purcell anticlinorium and overlying the basement reflectors. 75 km East along the profile is the exposure of the Lewis fault in the Waterton area, which directly links to the most displaced portion of the hanging wall.",

Results showed that there was 75 km of direct movement of the thrust sheet along the Lewis fault, and an additional 40 km of transport by the formation of footwall-domain duplexes. Although this study did not take into consideration that it could be possible that the Lewis thrust sheet moved further east along the prairies and was eroded away, the data proved to be of high quality as it allowed excellent ties to be made to previous drill holes, mapped structures, measured stratigraphy, and existing geologic and seismic data. This study acted as a reinforcement to previous work and was very consistent with previous data collected. Additionally, this seismic data presented is significant in extensional terms as a direct link between reflectors on the West and East sides of the Rocky Mountain trench correlate to the same stratigraphic unit, where extension can be restored and an extensional distance of about 10 km was calculated by the difference of the pre extension and post extension.

More specifically, attempting to determine if the thrust movement was continuous or if movement was subject to a more stick-slip style of movement remains inconclusive. However, the anomalously high vitrinite reflectance values obtained from the Lewis thrust at Marias Pass, the McConnell thrust at Mt. Yamnuska, the Coleman fault at Wintering Creek and several others indicate temperatures of 350 650  C were generated during thrusting. Furthermore, these high vitrinite reflectance values were restricted to extremely narrow sections adjacent to and within the fault zones. This is indicative that the high temperatures were fairly short-lived. Thus, the high temperatures are interpreted to be the result of frictional heating during stick slip faulting. Evidence for the local high temperatures within the fault zone indicate that local areas of frictional stress must have existed, with the possibility of this occurring due to ramps in the fault plane where drainage of high pore pressures may have occurred. Moreover, samples from the hanging wall collected in close proximity to the fault plane show no evidence for heating during progressive burial of sediments. This absence of evidence for heating during faulting is indicative of low frictional stress and therefore, low rates of slip.",

Poigai composed hundred verses that are classified as Mutal Tiruvantati, and his composition is set in the antati style, in which the ending syllable is the starting one for the next verse. According to traditional account, the first three Alvars belong to Dvapara Yuga (before 4200 BCE). As per Hindu legend, Poigai was found in a small pond near the Yadhotakaari temple at Tiruvekkaa. In Tamil, small pond is called poigai, and since he was found in a pond, he got the name Poigai. As per legend, the three Alvars were once confined in a small dark enclosure during a rain in Thirukovilur and they experienced a fourth individual among them.",

They found out that it was god Vishnu and Poigai Alvar wished to see his face continuously but could view only from the simmering light of the lightning. With a view to maintain the continuity of light, he instantly composed hundred songs wishing light to emerge. The other two continued composing hundred songs each on Vishnu. The works of these earliest saints contributed to the philosophical and theological ideas of Vaishnavism. Along with the three Shaiva Nayanmars, they influenced the ruling Pallava kings of the South Indian region, resulting in changing the religious geography from Buddhism and Jainism to the two sects of Hinduism. Alvars\nThe word Alvar means the 'immersed', referring to the poet-saints's deep devotion to their supreme deity, Vishnu. The Alvars are considered the twelve supreme devotees of Vishnu in Sri Vaishnavism, who were instrumental in popularising Vaishnavism during the 5th to 8th centuries CE. The religious works of these saints in Tamil, songs of love and devotion, are compiled as Naalayira Divya Prabandham, containing 4000 verses, with each of the 108 temples revered in their songs is classified as a Divya Desam.",

The Alvars were also instrumental in promoting the Bhagavata cult and the two epics of India, namely, Ramayana and Mahabharata. The Alvars were instrumental in spreading Vaishnavism throughout the region.

He was variously known as Ayonigi, Saro-yogi, Kasara-yogi, Poigai-piraan, Saravora Munindra and Padma-muni. Kanchi derives its name from Brahma, who is known as Ka; who worshipped God in this kshetram. In that famed city, in a lotus flower within a lotus pond, under the star Thiruvonam (Sravanam) which is the star of God Himself, Poigai was born. He gave the wonderful Mutal Tiruvantati pasuram, which is like a lamp that drives away the darkness of the mind and elevates the soul. Composition\nAs per Hindu legend, Vishnu appeared to the Mutal Alvars (first three Alvars) at Thirukkoilur. It was day time, but it darkened and started raining heavily.

In the meanwhile, Pei Alvar also came to the same place as all the three preferred to stand because of lack of space. The darkness became dense and inside the small room, they were not able to see each other. In the meanwhile, they felt a fourth person also forced his way among them. The three Alvars realised from the light of the lightning that the fourth one had a charming face that was sublime and divine. The trio could immediately realize that it was Vishnu who was huddling among them. Poigai Alvar wished to see Vishnu's face continuously, but could view only from the simmering light of the lightning. With a view to maintain the continuity of light, he instantly composed hundred songs wishing the earth to be a big pot full of ghee like an ocean where the sun could be the burning wick. Deeming in the world as bowl, the full sea as ghee, the fierce-rayed sun as a luminous wick, I have twined a garland of speech for the feet of Him who wields the red flaming discus so that there may be freedom from the ocean of misery.",

    "text": "Great Rocks Dale is a dry valley in the Derbyshire Peak District, known for its extensive quarrying. Geography and geology\nThe valley runs from Peak Dale down to Blackwell Mill at Chee Dale on the River Wye. The scenery is of limestone, which extends to a depth of around 380 metres. It contains the only dikes in the White Peak. Boreholes have enabled the extraction of significant amounts of water, used by local industry. Before the quarrying, the southern part of the valley was described as  narrow, flat-bottomed, rocky... with  almost perpendicular cliffs of limestone on either side... , whereas the northern part was broader and grassy. History\nThe dale fell within the bounds of the mediaeval Forest of High Peak. The surrounding land was first farmed in about 1250, by people connected with the nearby hamlet of Tunstead. In 1867, an extension of the Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway was opened, running through the valley between Peak Forest and Millers Dale. This section of line remains open, for freight traffic, now known as the Great Rocks Line after this area. The valley is now dominated by Tunstead Quarry, a large limestone quarry, worked since 1929. Given its economic importance, the boundary of the Peak District National Park was carefully drawn to exclude the dale.",

Given its economic importance, the boundary of the Peak District National Park was carefully drawn to exclude the dale. By 1973, Tunstead was the largest quarry in Europe, and permission to extend it into the National Park was rejected on the grounds that there was sufficient stone to last until at least 2000. Following a Public Inquiry and a High Court case, the Secretary of State ultimately overrode the National Park Authority's decision and granted permission for a 148.57-hectare (367.1-acre) extension within the Peak District National Park. It remains the largest producer of limestone in the Peak District, with about 5.5 million tonnes extracted each year. In 1932, quarrying opened a fissure which contained remains of bison, Irish elk and deer, washed down from the surface in the distant past. In 1957, the painter Peter Lanyon visited the valley to study the faces of the quarry, seeing them as revealing both the geological and human history of the area.

Land for the town was purchased because it was inexpensive old farm land that had artesian wells. It was also located near the Santa Fe Railroad line. Ranchers, farmers, skilled workers, teachers, and business people were lured to the town in south Tulare County, California. Several events led to the closing of the town. Allen, who was the leader of the town, died in an accident in 1914. Over time, the town experienced a shortage of water. The Great Depression and World War II drew people to places with greater opportunities. More people left when three of the town's wells were found to have arsenic in 1965. Wishing to maintain the historic town, supporters lobbied to make the area a park. Governor Ronald Reagan signed the legislation to make a park from some of the land in 1973.

    "text": "St Patrick's are a Gaelic Athletic Association club located in Chapelizod and Palmerstown, South Dublin. History\nThe club was founded in 1961 and took its name because that was the Patrician year. The club colours came about as one of the founders, Peter Kavanagh, had two sets of jerseys, one green and the other red. Originally the main colours were to be green and white (the colours of Saint Patrick and the shamrock) but because neighbouring clubs Round Towers and Lucan Sarsfields used green and white, it was decided to use red and white and keep the green as second colours. The first match to ever take place was the U13 s against Round Towers of Clondalkin which John Daly (founder and current club President) refereed. The match took place in a field where the Assembly Hall and St Brigid's School currently stands today. The first championship won was U16 1 2 football in 1966. St Patrick's have traditionally been stronger in football but in recent times have enjoyed more success on the hurling front. St Patrick's won the Dublin Junior Hurling Championship for the first time in 1998. The club gained Senior hurling status for the first time in 2004 when they lifted the Dublin Intermediate Hurling Championship. In 2008 they lifted the Dublin Senior B Hurling Championship, thus gaining promotion to the Dublin Senior Hurling Championship.",

This decision was born out of their genuine concern of the land's wildlife. In 1969 it was established by Shaikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan and in 1972 it opened to the public. Among the species they wanted to protect were ungulates such as the Arabian oryx. Today, the zoo hosts over 4,000 animals, some of them extinct in the wild, some endangered. It features a big cat house containing lions, mountain lions, jaguars, black panthers, leopards, and cheetahs. In addition, it has a reptile house, monkey compounds, an aquarium, and an aviary. From February 2010 until July 2010, the Al Ain Zoo hosted the  Dinosaur Trail,  a small section that includes around 15 to 20 mechanical dinosaurs with sensors, such as Tyrannosaurus rex. It included information about each dinosaur, living habits, natural habitat and basic features. In April 2019 the zoo began its expansion program in order to build new compounds' areas and sites, such as the conservation and breeding centres, African Safari, World Desert Zoo, and the Sheikh Zayed Desert Learning Centre.",

In March 2022, as the zoo intended to import wild African elephants from Namibia, the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums published its thoughts on the matter. They stated that according to their Code of Ethics it is essential from time to time to make such actions. This is needed in light of global efforts of conservation breeding programs, education programs, or basic biological studies. Having said that, they continued their statement that concluded that the zoo's intention to import African elephants does not meet WAZA's Code of Ethics. The outcome of that statement was the decision to terminate Al Ain Zoo membership in WAZA until further notice. Following that event and statement, on September 15, 2022, the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) also announced the termination of the membership of Al Ain Zoo in the United Arab Emirates. The zoo s membership ended on December 31, 2022, following the decision of the EAZA Council that EAZA can no longer reasonably be expected to allow the institution to remain a member.

Genrich and the city of Green Bay filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin about two weeks before the April 7 elections, stating that they did not have the capacity to carry out the election as directed, and asking for an injunction to delay the election until June. The suit was quickly dismissed by the court, which said it lacked jurisdiction to rule on the matter. A subsequent order from Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers to postpone the election also fell in the Wisconsin Supreme Court. The election went forward as scheduled on April 7, though with less than 10  of their normal election workers. Brown County Clerk Sandy Juno offered to allocate Wisconsin National Guard personnel to manage polling stations, but Green Bay (along with other neighboring municipalities) refused, citing a lack of training. As a result of the personnel shortages, Green Bay could operate only 2 of their 31 in-person polling locations and endured long lines of voters waiting to cast their ballots.

    "text": "Mecistocephalus glabridorsalis is a species of soil centipede in the Mecistocephalidae family. This centipede is found in Seychelles. This species features 49 pairs of legs and can reach 85 mm in length. Discovery\nThis centipede was first described in 1900 by the Austrian myriapodologist Carl Attems. He based the original description of this centipede on two specimens, an adult male and a juvenile. These specimens were found on the island of Mahé in Seychelles. Taxonomy\nAttems originally described this centipede as a subspecies of Mecistocephalus punctifrons. In 1902, the Swiss zoologists Henri de Saussure and Leo Zehntner elevated M. glabridorsalis to the rank of species. Some other authors, however, continued to deem this centipede a subspecies or a junior synonym of M. punctifrons. Authorities now regard M. glabridorsalis as an accepted species. In 1981, the French myriapodologist Jean-Marie Demange described M. vanmoli as a new species based on specimens found on the island of Mahé in Seychelles. In 2010, the Italian biologists Lucio Bonato and Alessandro Minelli deemed M. vanmoli to be a junior synonym of M. glabridorsalis.",

Description\nThe species M. glabridorsalis features 49 leg-bearing segments and can reach 85 mm in length. The body is mostly yellow with some dark pigment on the dorsal surface of the trunk, but the head and anterior segments are reddish brown. The head is about 1.6 to 1.9 times longer than wide. The dorsal surface of the head features a transverse frontal line that is uniformly curved. Each antenna is about four or five times longer than the head is wide. The areolate area on the anterior part of the clypeus is about as long as the smooth areas on the posterior part of the clypeus (plagulae). This areolate area features about four pairs of setae arranged in a transverse row, but with the middle pair usually posterior to the others. The pleurites on the sides of the head (buccae) feature setae only on the posterior half. Each mandible can feature up to 16 or 17 pectinate lamellae (comb blades).",

Its text is widely attributed to Pellegrino Rossi, later Papal Minister of Interior under Pope Pius IX. While it is primarily considered as a desperate attempt from Murat to retain the Neapolitan throne, the Rimini Proclamation was among the earliest calls for Italian unification. The Rimini Proclamation is dated to 30 March 1815, when Murat's army was passing through Rimini in the Neapolitan War against the Austrian Empire, though it may have been published only after Murat's defeat at the Battle of Tolentino in May 1815. The citizens' address begins with the call:\nItalians! The hour has come to engage in your highest destinies. Background\nThe Kingdom of Naples, which ruled the southern half of the Italian peninsula, was a client state of Napoleon Bonaparte's French Empire. In 1808, Napoleon named Joachim Murat as King of Naples; Murat had married Caroline Bonaparte, Napoleon's younger sister, in 1800. The northern half of the Italian peninsula was divided by the French Empire and, from 17 March 1805, the Kingdom of Italy, another French client state, with Napoleon as King of Italy.",

On 11 January 1814, the Kingdom of Naples and the Austrian Empire signed the Treaty of Naples, under which Murat defected to the coalition. As part of the treaty, Murat would keep the Neapolitan throne in return for sending 30,000 troops against the Kingdom of Italy. Murat's troops passed through the city of Rimini, at the southern tip of the Kingdom of Italy, on 1 February 1814. Following further military defeats, Napoleon abdicated on 6 April 1814. At the Congress of Vienna, Klemens von Metternich, Austria's Foreign Minister, was bound by other coalition allies that wanted to restore Ferdinand IV of the House of Bourbon to the Neapolitan throne, particularly Britain. With his throne no longer secure, following Napoleon's return from exile, Murat switched sides in an unsuccessful attempt to return to Napoleon's favour. On 15 March 1815, the Kingdom of Naples declared war on the Austrian Empire, starting the Neapolitan War.",

Murat's eastern column advanced northwards from Rimini towards the River Po, entering Bologna on 2 April, while the western column reached Florence on 8 April. On the same day, the eastern column engaged 3,000 Austrian soldiers at the Battle of Occhiobello. Following its defeat at Occhiobello, it was pushed southwards, leading to Murat's decisive defeat at the Battle of Tolentino on 2 3 May. Murat returned to Naples on 18 May, where Caroline had already surrendered to the British, and fled immediately to southern France.",

    "text": "Murat returned to Naples on 18 May, where Caroline had already surrendered to the British, and fled immediately to southern France. Hearing of Napoleon's defeat at the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815, Murat fled to Corsica, from which he attempted an impossible invasion of Calabria. Napoleon remarked:  Murat attempted to reconquer with 200 men that territory which he failed to hold when he had 80,000 at his disposal. Murat was captured, sentenced to death, and shot by firing squad in Pizzo Calabro on 13 October 1815. In Il re lazzarone (1999), Risorgimento scholar Giuseppe Campolieti hypothesises that the Rimini Proclamation was only published on 12 May 1815, after Murat's defeat at Tolentino, and backdated to 30 March. Legacy\nThe Rimini Proclamation is primarily considered a desperate attempt from Murat to retain the Neapolitan throne. Nevertheless, and somewhat ironically for a French king, it was among the earliest calls for Italian unification and independence. The proclamation impressed poet Alessandro Manzoni, who wrote a song entitled Il proclama di Rimini , but he left it unfinished after Murat's campaign failed.

Developed as a critique of modernist theories of nationalism, ethnosymbolism emphasizes historical roots of nations in drawing on ethnic symbols, myths, values and traditions inherited from earlier ages. Like the modernists, and in contrast to primordialists, ethnosymbolist scholars agree nationalism is a distinctly modern phenomena. The term was first used as  ethno-symbolist approach  in an article by Daniele Conversi, Smith's former student at the London School of Economics. However, Conversi was slightly critical, arguing:  if we focus exclusively on the power of the past and its symbols, we miss two other key features of nationalism: first, its relationship with political power, and particularly with the state; second, its crucial border-generating function . John A. Armstrong, Anthony D. Smith and John Hutchinson are commonly regarded as key theorists of ethnosymbolism. Important theorists\nJohn A. Armstrong\nArmstrong's contribution to ethnosymbolism is his  myth-symbol complexes  in Nations before Nationalism (1982), which firstly underlined the significance of la longue durée, according to Anthony D.

    "text": "Armstrong\nArmstrong's contribution to ethnosymbolism is his  myth-symbol complexes  in Nations before Nationalism (1982), which firstly underlined the significance of la longue durée, according to Anthony D. Smith. Armstrong believes that ethnic consciousness can far back in ancient civilisations such as Egypt, and that nationalism is merely  the final stage of a larger cycle of ethnic consciousness reaching back to the earliest forms of collective organization . Therefore, similar to the longue durée of Annales School, formation of ethnic identity should be examined across a timespan of many centuries. Drawing on the work of Fredrik Barth, Armstrong argues that  groups tend to define themselves not by reference to their own characteristics but by exclusion, that is, by comparison to 'strangers' . In other words, the character of a group is never fixed, and in accordance with group member's individual perceptions the boundaries of identities vary. Armstrong contrasts this to modern nationalist thought, which  has sought permanent  essences  of national character instead of recognizing the fundamental but shifting significance of boundaries for human identity . Despite these pursuits, Armstrong maintains that, historically,  persistent group identity did not ordinarily constitute the overriding legitimization of polity formation . Nonetheless, for Armstrong,  myth, symbol, communication and cluster of associated attitudinal factors are usually more persistent than purely material factors , indicating his emphasis on the persistence of symbolic boundary mechanisms.",

    "text": "Nonetheless, for Armstrong,  myth, symbol, communication and cluster of associated attitudinal factors are usually more persistent than purely material factors , indicating his emphasis on the persistence of symbolic boundary mechanisms. He specified and analysed several factors that ensure such persistence. The first such factor, also the most general one, is ways of life and the experiences associated with them. There are two fundamentally different ways of life: the nomadic and the sedentary. The second factor is religion, exemplified by Christianity and Islam, both of which gave birth to different civilizations and myths symbols. The third factor is city formation, whose effect upon ethnic identification requires examination of a host of factors ranging from the impact of town planning to the unifying of centrifugal effects of various legal codes, especially the Lübeck and Magdeburg law. The fourth factor is the role of imperial polities in maintaining myth-symbol complexes across dispersed geographical spaces. The final factor is language. Uniquely, Armstrong concludes that  the significance of language for ethnic identity is highly contingent  in the pre-modern era. Its significance relied on political and religious force and allegiances for centuries. In his later works, Armstrong more explicitly agreed with modernists like Benedict Anderson and Eric Hobsbawm that national identity had been an invention, although he maintained an emphasis on  the antiquity of some inventions and the repertory of pre-existing group characteristics that inventors were able to draw upon .

    "text": "Anthony D. Smith\nA former student of the prominent modernist Ernest Gellner, Anthony D. Smith developed a distinct perspective from his teacher, best exemplified in the so-called  LSE debate  on nationalism (named by Gellner). Smith argues the  modern state cannot be understood without taking pre-existing ethnic components into account, the lack of which is likely to create a serious impediment to 'nation-building . Smith believed the definitions of  nation  and  nationalism  offered by both modernism and primordialism were limited. For him, the problem of modernism is mainly that modernists define nation as  modern nation  with characters of European nations of 18th and 19th centuries, making their definition Eurocentric and partial. Instead, Smith proposes an  ideal-typical  definition of the nation:  A named human population sharing an historic territory, common myths and historical memories, a mass, public culture, a common economy and common legal rights and duties for all members . Smith also introduces the important term ethnie, meaning  ethnic group , which is used to describe pre-modern ethnic communities.",

Ethnies contain six main attributes:\na collective proper name\na myth of common ancestry\nshared historical memories\none or more differentiating elements of common culture\nan association with a specific  homeland \na sense of solidarity for significant sectors of the population\nAccording to Smith, there are four main mechanisms of ethnic self-renewal:\nreligious reform, as exemplified in the history of Jews\ncultural borrowing, exemplified with encounter between Jewish and Greek cultures\npopular participation, exemplified with the socio-religious popular movement of the Mazdakites in 5th-century Sassanid Persia undermining the foundations of the Sassanid state\nmyths of ethnic election, the lack of which might be related to the diminishment of ethnic survival of Assyria, Phoenicia and the Philistines\nIn order to understand why and how a nation emerges, Smith posits two types of ethnic community: the lateral (aristocratic) and the vertical (demotic). Lateral communities are usually made up of aristocrats and elites. For example, the Normans were united by shared myths of descent and the achievements of their dukes, but this identity was limited to the upper classes. On the other hand, vertical communities are more inclusive and connect different social classes through shared culture and history.",

For instance, the Israelite community united various social groups with common religious and historical traditions. In later works, Smith added a third type: immigrant nations that consist of the fragments of other ethnies, such as the United States and Australia. According to Smith there are three ways in which the past may influence the national present:\nThrough the recurrence of the nation-form. The concept of the nation, Smith tells us, refers to a type of cultural resource and of human association that is potentially available in all periods of human history. Through established continuities. Continuity can be found in  collective proper names, language codes and ethnic landscapes, all of which may linger on, even after the community to which they were attached has all but vanished . These components may also provide the framework for the revival of the community in a new form. Smith refers to the Greeks as a good example of this revival through continuity of names, language and landscapes. Through appropriation and reinterpretation - exemplified in the tendency of later generations to rediscover, authenticate, and appropriate aspects of what they consider to be  their  ethnic past.

    "text": "John Hutchinson\nJohn Hutchinson was a PhD student of Smith's at the London School of Economics. Hutchinson's primary contribution to ethnosymbolism is the theory of cultural nationalism, developed in the Dynamics of Cultural Nationalism (1987). Hutchinson separates nationalism into  political nationalism  and  cultural nationalism , which are different, even competing conceptions of the nation, and  have sharply diverging political strategies . Political nationalists are essentially cosmopolitan rationalists whose conception of nation  looks forward ultimately to a common humanity transcending cultural differences . Although the fact that the world has been divided into multiple political communities has forced them to work within existing borders, political nationalists' objectives are to  secure a representative state for their community so that it might participate as an equal in the developing cosmopolitan rationalist civilization . In contrast, cultural nationalists believe humanity is  infused with a creative force which endows all things with an individuality  similar to nature. They regard the state as accidental, since for them a nation is essentially a distinctive civilisation,  the product of its unique history, culture and geographical profile . Nations are organic entities and living personalities. Hutchinson contests that cultural nationalism hardly draws attention from theories of modernism. Not only has he challenged modernism in his earlier works, he has also engaged postmodernism in his more recent works, especially in Nations as Zones of Conflict (2005).",

Criticism\nThomas Hylland Eriksen says it is misleading to claim there is an unbroken continuity from pre-modern cultures to national ones. Similarly, Walker Connor and John Breuilly criticize ethnosymbolists for conflating ethnic groups and nations. Breuilly argues it is impossible to know from the evidence what meaning ethnic sentiments had for the majority of the people in the pre-modern era, going on to note how, unlike modern nations, many pre-modern identities lack an institutional basis through which national identity achieves form. Breuilly is also skeptical of anachronistic readings of cultural materials from the past, explaining how nationalist\nintellectuals and politicians seize upon myths and symbols in order to promote a particular national identity. Indeed, in many cases, he argues nationalists simply invent myths or ignore contrary evidence. Furthermore, in contrast to the ethnosymbolist emphasis on early symbols, myths, values and traditions, Breuilly states there are many nationalist movements that have succeeded without having a rich ethnohistory to feed upon. Umut Özkirimli and Spyros Sofos criticize the unproblematic relationship between nations and ethnies posited by Smith, suggesting that ethnosymbolist thinking is marked by  retrospective ethnicization .",

That is, scholars  ethnicize  a complex, contradictory and ambiguous past, packaging together disparate cultural and social traditions, often unrelated to each other, using the notion of ethnie. They argue that nations are defined by nationalists who also retrospectively construct these ethnies -  collections collations of cultural practices established over time or invented, and forged together often arbitrarily, according to the judgement or needs of nation-builders politicians or romantic folklorists, musicologists, educationalists and so on most often the product of retrospective legitimation of the very processes that have underpinned nationalist projects . Craig Calhoun argues that tracing continuity in ethnic traditions does not explain which traditions last or which will become the basis for nations. He emphasizes how traditions are not simply inherited, but reproduced, adapted to new circumstances to keep them meaningful, which may change meanings considerably. Further reading\nMaxwell, A.

Therefore, the imperial cities of Heilbronn and Schwäbisch Hall moved in 1440 before with an army of 600 men on horseback against Mundelsheim and destroyed the community. 1595 Mundelsheim was sold to the House of Württemberg. Until 1806 was Mundelsheim seat of an urban district that came up first in the rural district office Beilstein and then in the rural district office Marbach.

The show was staged at the end of June 2009 at the Château des ducs de Bretagne in Nantes, and was preceded by an album in which over 200 musicians participated. Work with Studio Ghibli\nAfter promotion ended for SongBook vol. 2, Corbel still had some promo albums left, so she sent them to people she admired. She sent one to Studio Ghibli because she had been a fan of their films for years. At the time, Arrietty was in pre-production and producer Toshio Suzuki wanted a Celtic-inspired film score. Less than ten days later, she received an email from Studio Ghibli about her CD. The envelope, because it was handwritten, had caught the eye of Suzuki, and he had listened to the CD. He was captivated by Corbel's voice and the sound of the harp, and played the CD for the film's director and Yamaha Music. As a result, Corbel was assigned to write the title song of the film. She was later asked to write more songs. By 2009, she was asked to compose the whole score. This was the first time a non-Japanese composer had worked with the studio.",

    "text": "The Ukrainian People's Republic (UPR) was a short-lived state in Eastern Europe. Prior to its proclamation, the Central Council of Ukraine was elected in March 1917 as a result of the February Revolution, and in June, it declared Ukrainian autonomy within Russia. Its autonomy was later recognized by the Russian Provisional Government. Following the October Revolution, the Central Council of Ukraine denounced the Bolshevik seizure of power and proclaimed the Ukrainian People's Republic with a territory including the area of approximately eight Russian imperial governorates (Kiev, Volhynia, Kharkov, Kherson, Yekaterinoslav, Poltava, Chernigov and Podolia). It formally declared its independence from Russia on 22 January 1918. During its short existence, the republic went through several political transformations   from the socialist-leaning republic headed by the Central Council of Ukraine with its general secretariat, to the socialist republic led by the Directorate and by Symon Petliura. Between April and December 1918, the socialist authority of the Ukrainian People's Republic was suspended, having been overthrown by the pro-German Ukrainian State of Pavlo Skoropadskyi, who was elected as the Hetman of Ukraine by a congress of peasants. After the collapse of the Ukrainian State, the Ukrainian People's Republic declared its unification with the West Ukrainian People's Republic in January 1919. After the Polish Ukrainian War, it signed an alliance with the Second Polish Republic.",

After the Polish Ukrainian War, it signed an alliance with the Second Polish Republic. On 10 November 1920, the state lost the remainder of its territory to the Bolsheviks. The Peace of Riga on 18 March 1921 between Poland, Soviet Russia (acting also on behalf of Soviet Belarus), and Soviet Ukraine sealed the fate of the Ukrainian People's Republic. After the October Revolution, many governments formed in the territory of Ukraine, most notably the Ukrainian People's Republic of Soviets based in Kharkov, and its Soviet successors. This force, along with the Ukrainian People's Republic, the White movement, Poland, Green armies, and anarchists, fought constantly with each other, which resulted in many casualties among Ukrainians fighting in the Ukrainian War of Independence as part of the wider Russian Civil War of 1917 1923. Soviet Russia would extend its control over what would ultimately become the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, which became a founding member of the Soviet Union in 1922.

The highest governing body of the Ukrainian People's Republic became the General Secretariat headed by Volodymyr Vynnychenko. The Prime Minister of Russia Alexander Kerensky recognized the Secretariat, appointing it as the representative governing body of the Russian Provisional Government and limiting its powers to five governorates: Volyn, Kiev Governorate, Podolia, Chernigov, and Poltava. At first Vynnychenko protested and left his post as Secretariat leader, but eventually returned to reassemble the Secretariat after the Tsentralna Rada accepted the Kerensky Instruktsiya and issued the Second Universal. After the October Revolution the Kievan faction of the Bolshevik Party instigated the uprising in Kiev on 8 November 1917 in order to establish Soviet power in the city. Kiev Military District forces attempted to stop it, but after the Tsentralna Rada threw its support behind the Bolsheviks, the Russian forces were eliminated from Kiev. After expelling the government forces, the Rada announced a wider autonomy for the Ukrainian Republic, still maintaining ties to Russia, on 22 November 1917.",

It also stated that the people of the governorates: Voronezh, Kholm, and Kursk were welcome to join the republic through a referendum. Further the Tsentralna Rada in its Universal stated that because there was no Government in the Russian Republic after the October Revolution it proclaimed itself the Supreme governing body of the territory of Ukraine until order in the Russian republic could be restored. The Central Council of Ukraine called all revolutionary activities such as the October Revolution a civil war and expressed its hopes for the resolution of the chaos. After a brief truce, the Bolsheviks realized that the Rada had no intention of supporting the Bolshevik Revolution. They re-organized into an All-Ukrainian Council of Soviets in December 1917 in an attempt to seize power.

Less than a month later, on 9 February 1918, the Red Army seized Kiev. Besieged by the Bolsheviks and having lost much territory, the Rada was forced to seek foreign aid, and signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk on 9 February 1918 to obtain military help from the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires. Germany helped the Ukrainian Army force the Bolsheviks out of Ukraine. On 20 February 1918 the council of the Kuban People's Republic accepted the resolution for a federal union of Kuban with Ukraine as Bolshevik forces pushed towards Yekaterinodar. It was agreed to forward the resolution for ratification to the Ukrainian government. After the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Ukraine became a virtual protectorate of the German Empire which at that time seemed more favorable than being overrun by the Soviet forces that were spreading havoc in the country.",

Germany was anxious about losing the war and was trying to speed up the process of food extraction from Ukraine, so it decided to install its own administration in the person of Generalfeldmarschall von Eichhorn who replaced the Colonel General Alexander von Linsingen. On 6 April the commander of the Army group Kijew issued an order in which he explained his intentions to execute the conditions of the treaty. That, of course, conflicted with the laws of the Ukrainian government, which annulled his order. By April 1918 the German-Austrian Operation Faustschlag offensive had completely removed the Bolsheviks from Ukraine. The German Austro-Hungarian victories in Ukraine were due to the apathy of the locals and the inferior fighting skills of Bolsheviks troops compared to their Austro-Hungarian and German counterparts. The Germans arrested and disbanded the Tsentralna Rada on 29 April 1918 to stop the social reforms that were taking place and restarted the process of food supply transfer to Germany and Austria-Hungary. The German authorities also arrested the Ukrainian Prime Minister, Vsevolod Holubovych, on terrorist charges, and thus disbanded the Council of People's Ministers.",

The Hetmanate government also supported the confiscation of previously nationalized peasant lands by wealthy estate owners, often with the help of German troops. This led to unrest, the rise of a peasant partisan (guerrilla) movement, and a series of large-scale popular armed revolts. Negotiations were held to garner support from previous Rada members Petliura and Vynnychenko, but these activists worked to overthrow Skoropadsky. On 30 July, a Russian Left Socialist-Revolutionary, Boris Mikhailovich Donskoy, with help from the local USRP succeeded in assassinating von Eichhorn, blowing him up in downtown Kiev at a broadlight. Due to the impending loss of World War I by Germany and Austria-Hungary, Skoropadsky's sponsors, the Hetman formed a new cabinet of Russian Monarchists and committed to federation with a possible future non-Bolshevik Russia.

The latter agreement granted an autonomous status for Northern Epirus, as well as a number of rights for the local Greek populations, inside the borders of the newly established Principality of Albania. The assembly took place in the town of Delvinë (southern Albania) with the participation of deputies from all provinces of Northern Epirus. It lasted from June 23 to July 26, 1914, and led to the ratification of the terms of the Protocol of Corfu, despite objections raised by various sides asking for wider autonomy. The Greek government under Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, also supported the approval of the Protocol, as the only means to secure peace and stability for the region, while on the other hand the representatives of the coastal region of Himara, insisted that only incorporation to Greece would be a viable solution for Northern Epirus.

Thus, they reached a line from Himara on the Ionian coast east to Prespa Lake. Pending the final decision of the following peace treaty, the region remained under Greek military control. On 17 December 1913, the Protocol of Florence ceded the northern part of Epirus to the newly established Principality of Albania. This turn of events catalysed an uprising among the local Greek population, who declared the independence of Northern Epirus. The Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus was thus proclaimed in Argyrokastro (Gjirokastër) on 28 February 1914, while a provisional government was formed under Georgios Christakis-Zografos. Meanwhile, serious disturbances broke out in a number of places between the Northern Epirote forces and Albanian gendarmerie units and irregulars. An International Commission of Control formed by the Great Powers to secure stability and peace in the region was unable to achieve an agreement between the two sides. Protocol of Corfu\nBy May 17, 1914, at a meeting held nearby in Corfu, Greece, representatives from both sides signed an agreement that would be known as Protocol of Corfu.",

The Assembly met in session again at June 26, and discussions were long and intense. The strongest objections were raised by the representatives of Himara, and especially by its representative, Spyros Spyromilios. The latter considered that the Northern Epirotes had nothing to gain from this Protocol, despite the hard won struggle. Especially, he claimed that the Protocol s provisions about Himara, were left to the goodwill of the International Commission of Control.

Aftermath\nThe Protocol of Corfu, although having been accepted by both sides and sanctioned by the Great Powers, was unable to be implemented. After the outbreak of World War I on July 28, 1914, the situation in Albania became unstable and political chaos ensued. When the country became split into a number of regional governments, Prince William departed the country in September 1914. On 27 October, after approval of the Great Powers, the Greek army re-entered Northern Epirus and the Provisional Government of Northern Epirus formally ceased to exist, declaring that it had accomplished its objectives. The region was de facto annexed to Greece until the second half of 1916, when Italian troops evicted the Greek army from the area. After the end of World War I it was finally ceded to the Principality of Albania. References\nSources\nBoeckh, Katrin (1996).

    "text": "Scream is a 1996 American slasher film directed by Wes Craven and written by Kevin Williamson. It stars David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, Matthew Lillard, Rose McGowan, Skeet Ulrich, and Drew Barrymore. Set in the fictional town of Woodsboro, California, the plot follows high school student Sidney Prescott (Campbell) and her friends, who, on the anniversary of her mother's murder, become the targets of a costumed serial killer. Williamson, who was struggling to get his projects off the ground, was inspired by reports of a series of murders by the Gainesville Ripper as he wrote a screenplay that satirized the clichés of the slasher genre popularized in films such as Halloween (1978), Friday the 13th (1980), and Craven's own A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984). Developed under the title Scary Movie, Williamson's script became the subject of an intense bidding war from multiple studios before Miramax Films purchased the rights for its Dimension Films label. Craven, despite turning down the opportunity multiple times, agreed to direct the film after he had read the script as he was determined to re-establish himself after several career setbacks. The involvement of Barrymore and Cox helped secure more support from the studio. Principal photography took place from April to June 1996 in California on a budget of  15 million.",

    "text": "The involvement of Barrymore and Cox helped secure more support from the studio. Principal photography took place from April to June 1996 in California on a budget of  15 million. Craven trimmed down the violence in the film after being involved in a tense conflict with the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) over the desired R rating. Released on December 20, Scream was not expected to perform well due to concerns over releasing a slasher film in a time normally reserved for holiday entertainment. However, it went on to gross approximately  173 million worldwide through the strength of word of mouth, becoming an unexpected success and one of the highest-grossing films of the year. Contemporary reviews were positive, with praise going to the performances of its cast and its unique meta humor, but criticism was directed at its excessive violence and lack of suspense in favor of that humor. Scream revitalized both Craven's and Barrymore's careers and helped bolster the careers of its young cast. In the years since its release, Scream's reception has continued to be positive. It has been credited with rekindling interest in the horror genre during the 1990s following a decline in the genre's popularity and has been credited for shifting the genre towards younger audiences and casting established actors. The film's opening sequence, in which Barrymore's character is killed by Ghostface, is considered one of the most shocking and subversive in cinematic history.",

Production\nWriting\nIn 1994, Kevin Williamson was a novice and financially struggling screenwriter, having recently sold his first script, Killing Mrs. Tingle (1999). While house-sitting, Williamson watched a Turning Point documentary about serial killer Danny Rolling which he said left him unsettled. Williamson later noticed an open window, armed himself with a knife, and called his friend for support. The pair began discussing horror characters that had resonated with them such as Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees. The following morning, Williamson was woken by a nightmare and used the experience as inspiration for the opening home invasion of Scream. He was also influenced by a one-act play he wrote in college about an unknown caller taunting a young girl.",

Williamson spent the next three days writing a script for a slasher film he called Scary Movie while listening to the score to Halloween for further inspiration. He also drafted two five-page outlines for possible sequels. He developed much of the script around a single line of dialogue,  movies don't create psychos, movies make psychos more creative . This was his response to contemporary concerns about the influence of cinematic violence on audience, and he  thought it was a great line . Williamson's script drew upon many of his favorite horror films, such as Halloween (1978), Friday the 13th, Prom Night (both 1980), and A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984). At the time, the successful slasher films of the 1970s and 1980s had fallen out of favor, in part because of increasingly poorly received sequels to long-running horror franchises.

I started playing with the tropes, and the 'rules' were part of that. The opening scene depicting Casey Becker's death emulates that of Janet Leigh's character in Psycho (1960) by killing off a possible main character early on. Williamson believed it would hook studio executives and leave audiences unsure how the plot would progress. Williamson set the script in his hometown of Bayboro, North Carolina, believing its quiet atmosphere would provide a strong contrast with a serial killer's actions. Williamson pursued Scary Movie because it was the type of horror film he enjoyed as a child but believed were no longer being made. Even so, he did not believe studios would develop and intended to use it to garner attention and secure other work. Williamson's agent had him scale back the gore, removing descriptions such as  the insides are slowly rolling down her leg , because it would make it difficult to sell the script.

Development\nBy 1995, there was competition to secure the rights to Scary Movie, with early interest expressed by Morgan Creek Entertainment, Paramount Pictures, Universal Pictures, and filmmaker Oliver Stone. The script came to the attention of producer Cathy Konrad of Woods Entertainment, which had a development deal with production studio Miramax Films. She brought it to Richard Potter, the director of development for Miramax Films' genre-film-focused subsidiary Dimension Films. Potter expected a  stupid spoof  but was drawn in by the opening scene and recommended Miramax Films chairman, Bob Weinstein, pursue the rights. He agreed, considering it an opportunity to produce films instead of distributing those of others. Although others offered larger figures, Williamson's lawyer advised him take Weinstein's offer ( 400,000  500,000) because Dimension Films was willing to make the film immediately. Williamson revised the script based on studio input, removing some gorier content (such as exposed internal organs and severed limbs) and adding the murder of principal Himbry because Weinstein said there was too long a period following the opening without any deaths. This solved a separate difficulty Williamson was having explaining why all but the core group of characters leave Stu's party in the finale, as they go to see Himbry's corpse.",

The Scary Movie title was also changed to Scream late in production because Weinstein was concerned Scary Movie would lead audiences to believe it was a comedy instead of a horror. The search for a director was protracted, with Danny Boyle, Tom McLoughlin, Sam Raimi, George A. Romero, Bryan Singer, Quentin Tarantino, Robert Rodriguez, and Anthony Waller being considered. No agreements were secured because those approached for the role interpreted the script as a comedy instead of a horror satire. Wes Craven was discounted by the studio due to his lack of experience directing satires. Craven liked the script but he wanted to work on less gory and more mainstream content (including a film adaptation of the 1959 horror novel The Haunting of Hill House) because of the negative public perception of him based on his previous films. Craven's assistant Julie Plec and producer Marianne Maddalena continued to push Scream to Craven. His interest was renewed after The Haunting of Hill House adaptation was cancelled and he experienced the personal disappointment of his failed horror comedy, Vampire in Brooklyn (1995). After reading the script, Plec said Craven suggested the studio  'make him an offer he can't refuse.' And so Dimension did. And he took it.",

Williamson met Craven to discuss the script, believing he would request substantial rewrites, but Craven's notes related mainly to typos and some minor additions including restoring some of the gorier content and refining the ending which was not yet fully realized. Williamson said  The story stayed pretty much intact, but we added some scares, and shortened it. Wes reworked some of the action sequences, and we would argue and go back and forth, but there's a point where I had to realize that Wes is more experienced than I am. Describing the script Craven said,  what it forces you to do is sort of look at the reality of things we typically look at as amusing, like the Friday the 13th type of deaths where people have arrows through their heads and kids scream and laugh. But that suddenly starts happening in their actual lives. Casting\nAtypical for the genre at the time, Scream featured a cast of established stars, such as Drew Barrymore and Courteney Cox, as well as relatively unknown actors. Executive producer Cary Woods used his friendship with Barrymore's agent to cast her in the lead role of Sidney Prescott, but she later requested the smaller role of Casey Becker.",

Maddalena suggested that Barrymore had wanted to leave the project entirely, but took the smaller role to avoid disappointing Bob Weinstein and his brother Harvey. The filmmakers agreed to the change, believing it would be impactful to kill off their most well-known actor during Scream's opening and convince audiences that no character was safe. Vinessa Shaw and Reese Witherspoon were also considered for Sidney Prescott. Witherspoon was discounted because she looked too young compared to the other cast, and Williamson's choice, Molly Ringwald, believed she was too old for the part. The final choices came down to Alicia Witt, Brittany Murphy, and Neve Campbell. According to Williamson, Campbell swiftly emerged as the favored choice among the principal crew and, to improve her chances, they filmed her screen-test first, forcing the other contenders to try and surpass her performance. Beach and Maddalena said Campbell brought athleticism from her dancing background with a combination of strength and vulnerability. Describing what attracted her to the role, Campbell said Sidney was  a fantastic character for any kind of movie  who transitions from  tormented, traumatized, insecure young woman to overwhelmingly empowered and strong .",

Woods suggested Courteney Cox for the cold and calculating Gale Weathers, believing it would be interesting to play against her typical personable characters in series such as Family Ties (1982 1989) and Friends (1994 2004). Craven did not believe Cox could play the part and so she wrote a letter assuring him that  being 'a bitch' wouldn't be a stretch at all . Brooke Shields and Janeane Garofalo were considered but a more established actress was preferred. David Arquette auditioned for unspecified younger characters, but he was attracted to the role of Dewey and acting against Cox. The character was written as a  dumb jock  but Arquette interpreted it as a  position of authority getting no respect ... He wants to be John Wayne ... He wants to be this tough guy, but he's just got a heart of gold. Rose McGowan's agent jeopardized her chance to play Tatum by insisting on a payment of  250,000 instead of the offered  50,000, which was lower than the  100,000 received by some other principal actors. As a result, McGowan had to reaudition for the role twice.",

McGowan influenced Tatum's design, dying her hair blonde to avoid having two dark-haired main female characters, removing an Indigo Girls poster from Tatum's bedroom (because she would not listen to the relatively older band), and rejecting costuming suggestions in favor of her self-bought outfits. Thora Birch and Natasha Lyonne also auditioned for the role; Lyonne was the preferred choice but, as she was under 18, could not consent to joining without parental permission. Believing he was rising in popularity, Vince Vaughn was the studio's preferred choice for Billy Loomis, but he was too ill to audition. Skeet Ulrich did not attend auditions because of scheduling conflicts but his girlfriend did and mentioned Ulrich brought her; Beach went out to meet him personally. Ulrich liked playing a serial killer after more innocent and naive previous roles. To develop his character, Ulrich researched serial murders, psychological profiles, and outfitted one of his hotel rooms to the Billy persona to help him get into character, outfitting it with punk rock posters and blacklights. He said,  I was into punk music in my teens and really just trying to recapture that angst ...

Henry Winkler shared an agent with Craven and made his cameo appearance as a favor. Lynn McCree, Sidney's mother, was a Sonoma local; she spent two hours taking pictures with Campbell for the role but had no knowledge of the character's backstory. Liev Schreiber took the part of Cotton Weary for  20,000 during an unrelated meeting with Bob Weinstein.

Pre-production\nIt was determined early on that Scream required too many different interior and exterior locations to be filmed on sets.

Craven initially researched Wilmington, North Carolina but it failed to meet his expectations:  I wanted to have very American looking houses ... and a lot of the houses there were very dark brown, or brick, and that didn't look attractive to me. Locations near Vancouver were discounted for similar reasons, as was Napa County, California. Santa Rosa in Sonoma County, California offered most features the filmmakers required, but the Weinsteins rejected the additional  1 to 2 million required to film there until the filmmakers convinced them that Craven's name would attract enough audiences to compensate for the added cost. The opening scene used a house in Glen Ellen. Miller said,  We didn't want homes that looked like castles, or that you could really protect yourself in ... so if somebody was going to be stalking them, they could get to them very quickly. Other Santa Rosa locations used in Scream include Sidney's house at 1820 Calistoga Road, interiors of Tatum's house at 824 McDonald Avenue, and the Bradley Video store, where Randy works. The Healdsburg, California town square appears as the location of the Woodsboro Town Square, the fountain, and the exterior of the town police station.

Cinematographer Mark Irwin unsuccessfully argued against using the property because it was on top of a hill, introducing logistical challenges for accessing trailers and equipment. Miller built a facade of barns in front of the house so trailers could be sited closer while remaining concealed. The art department extensively modified the house, adding Gothic elements such as beams and stained-glass windows to give it a haunted feel, painting the walls red (although they realized later this made the blood stand out less), and adding a white picket fence. The farmhouse-style home offered a  convoluted  layout for a convincing setting where the murders could occur without the other characters realizing. The production crew also added a volleyball net to make it appear as if a teenager lived there. Santa Rosa High School was selected to portray Woodsboro High School due to its gothic and castle-like imposing visuals. Ten days of filming were to take place there in early June at a cost of  30,000 to 50,000, but permission was revoked in March 1996 by the Santa Rosa school district. The change was ostensibly because of the disruption filming would cause during school hours and scheduled exams, but several school board members objected to the violent content in the script, and hundreds of locals attended a council meeting to debate against and for the production; the board ultimately voted against allowing filming.",

Craven estimated the disruption and location changes caused by the Santa Rosa district's decision cost the production  350,000, including the  27,000 the center was paid for three days of filming. The disruption to filming by the school was not forgotten, with the film's credits stating  No thanks whatsoever to the Santa Rosa city school district governing board. Williamson's script had not described the killer's appearance beyond wearing a  ghostly white mask . Special effects company KNB EFX Group was commissioned to design a mask, but the filmmakers disliked their  gargoyle-ish , witch, and goblin-like masks designs. While location scouting a house, Maddalena came across what would become the Ghostface mask. This mask, featuring a white shroud, was designed by Brigitte Sleiertin as  the Peanut-Eyed Ghost  for the novelty company Fun World in 1991, based on a design by makeup artist Loren Gitthens. However, Craven and the studio wanted to own the design used in the film and tasked KNB EFX with creating a similar but legally distinct design, stretching the nose and chin.

The killer's outfit was completed with a black shroud to avoid their clothing or movements hinting at their identity. Filming\nPrincipal photography began on April 15, 1996, on a  14 million budget. The first week was spent filming the Casey Becker scenes. To elicit the necessary emotions, Barrymore recalled a sad story developed with Craven and made herself hyperventilate. To enhance her performance, Jackson was situated outside the house so that he could see Barrymore while making the calls but she could not see him. Jackson was used similarly for other Ghostface call scenes, and never met the cast in person. He said  the scariest monsters are the monsters you don't see, but the monsters you make in your mind. So just having the voice to react to made it larger in their minds . For safety, stunt performers portrayed the killer in costume, although Craven portrays the killer in parts of the opening. The first few days of filming used a custom mask designed for Scream, but Craven did not like it and reshot various scenes with the Fun World design before it was licensed. Because the hung Casey was to appear gutted from chest to waist, effects artist Howard Berger decided against applying prosthetics to Barrymore in favor of a mannequin that could be hollowed out, showing her spine holding her upper and lower parts together.",

Barrymore was also criticized for lacking sex appeal because of the pageboy hairstyle she had chosen. Williamson recounted Craven receiving a call from the brothers and seeing  his back slump. He just started sliding down the chair. The studio considered firing Craven, and sent him dailies from other films, such as Nightwatch (1997), to demonstrate what they wanted for Scream. Konrad defended Craven to the brothers, and in response Bob Weinstein sent Dimension executives Cary Granat and Andrew Rona to the set to directly intervene.

Issues filming at the location, including difficulties with providing proper lighting because of the uneven landscape, exacerbated tensions between Craven and Irwin regarding the quality of Irwin's footage. Scream was filmed with an anamorphic lens, which distorts and stretches the image to achieve a specific aspect ratio. However, neither Craven nor Irwin had much experience with this type of lens. The crew, including Lussier, had raised concerns about lens flares and out-of-focus images, partially blaming the focus puller hired by Irwin. Lussier explained,  You can often tell your focus is supposed to be on somebody's eye usually, ... and the focus puller just hasn't moved with the actor . As a result, there were limited options during the editing process due to the inconsistent focus. Irwin said he was informed that all filmed footage was unusable and that 35 days of scenes needed to be reshot.

During Tatum's death scene, McGowan had trouble staying in the pet door as the garage door rose. To address this, the crew nailed her shirt to the frame to hold her in place.

Scream was rated NC-17 by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), restricting its audience to those over 17 years of age, which was considered  box-office suicide  by industry experts. The MPAA told Craven that Scream would never receive a more commercial R-rating, allowing younger people to see the film when accompanied by an adult. Craven said,  I'm a director who can do something very well but am not allowed to put it on screen. And they ultimately get you, as they did on this one, on intensity. They say, 'it's not a specific shot, it's not blood, it's just too intense' . The filmmakers eventually convinced the MPAA that Scream was a spoof, believing they were too focused on the horror aspects. It took up to nine cuts to address the MPAA's complaints, including removing any movement of Steve Orth's internal organs, trimming Kenny's throat being slit (because the actor's pained expression was too  disturbing ), moving Billy and Stu stabbing each other off screen, and reducing scenes of Casey's hanging body and Tatum's crushed head.",

Craven gave Beltrami a weekend to compose  The Cue from Hell , the score for the film's opening sequence, which secured his hiring. Beltrami wrote the piece from Casey's perspective and used an  operatic  style, employing a range of instruments, including piano and brass. Beltrami described himself as  bumbling  through the scoring process, acknowledging his limited knowledge of horror music styles. He incorporated elements of the western genre, particularly for Dewey's theme, and took cues from composers including Elliot Goldenthal, Ennio Morricone, Eric Serra, Christopher Young, and Hans Zimmer. Due to budget constraints, Beltrami had to work with a small orchestra of fewer than 50 performers. To compensate for the lack of string harmonics, he instructed the string players to whistle, and asked Craven, Lussier, Maddalena, and Woods to join and boost their numbers. Beltrami identified most with Sidney's character and considered her theme    Sidney's Lament    to be one of the score's crucial pieces.",

He chose not to assign a distinctive motif to Ghostface, to avoid hinting at the killer's identity. Licensed music for Scream was provided by TVT Records and includes covers of  (Don't Fear) The Reaper  by Gus Black and  Birds Fly (Whisper to a Scream)  by Soho,  School's Out  by Alice Cooper,  First Cool Hive  by Moby, and  Drop Dead Gorgeous  by Republica. Excepts from the Halloween score are also present. Release\nContext\nOver forty films were scheduled for release in late 1996, including Beavis and Butt-Head Do America, Jerry Maguire, Mars Attacks!, Ransom, Space Jam, and Star Trek: First Contact. Bob Weinstein opted to release Scream in December as counterprogramming, offering teenagers an alternative to more traditional holiday fare. The decision was unpopular with the cast and crew, with Williamson expecting the film to fail. Weinstein explained,  people said we were crazy to put out Scream over Christmas ... It was a thriller; it didn't have big stars; it couldn't compete. Well, after Beavis and Butt-Head, where is that audience going to go? The marketing for Scream positioned Barrymore as the lead character to intentionally shock the audience with her death.",

During a promotional interview, Ulrich inadvertently revealed he portrayed one of the killers and called his agent to get the story blocked. Box office\nThe premiere of Scream took place on December 18, 1996, at the AVCO theater in Westwood, Los Angeles. It was released in the United States and Canada on December 20. During its opening weekend, the film grossed  6.4 million across 1,413 theaters an average of  4,497 per theater making it the fourth-highest-grossing film of the weekend, behind 101 Dalmatians ( 7 million), Jerry Maguire ( 13.1 million), and the debut of Beavis and Butt-Head Do America ( 20.1 million). The performance was considered a failure by industry professionals, resulting in Variety labeling Scream  dead on arrival . Maddalena recounted herself and Craven observing a raucous audience for Beavis and Butt-Head Do America while Scream had  maybe seven people in there. No one was laughing or screaming. We went away so dejected. However, Scream received positive audience word-of-mouth and exit-polling responses, leading the studio to increase the marketing and distribution budget.",

This contributed to Scream's performance improving in the following weeks. Although it fell to fifth place in its second weekend, it increased its weekend gross to  9.1 million, and again in its third weekend, rising to third place with  10 million. Scream remained in the top-ten-highest-grossing films for nine weeks in total, becoming a surprise success and grossing a total of  103 million.

It was Miramax's second film to gross  100 million in the United States and Canada after Pulp Fiction (1994). The film was most successful with teenagers and young people in their 20s. Outside of the U.S. and Canada, Scream is estimated to have grossed a further  70 million, including  14 million in the United Kingdom, making it the number 21 highest-grossing film.

After four weeks of release, it became the highest-grossing horror film in France, with a gross of  6.2 million (37.9 million French Francs). In Japan, the release date was postponed from May 1997 to August after the murder of a 14-year-old boy, whose killer was apparently obsessed with horror movies. Industry analysis showed that most of the films released toward the end of the year were box office failures, including both big-budget fare and a surge of films targeted toward women. Only a few were seen as successes, including 101 Dalmatians, Beavis and Butt-Head Do America, Jerry Maguire, Ransom, Scream, and Star Trek: First Contact. The success of Scream resulted in additional financial compensation for the principal crew and cast, triggered by the box office surpassing  40 million and subsequent increments of  10 million up to  100 million. Kennedy noted that his first residual check was double his salary. Reception\nCritical response\nScream received generally positive reviews. Critics, such as Roger Ebert, James Berardinelli, and Owen Gleiberman, praised Scream's meta commentary about its horror predecessors and its self-referential humor while also writing that the self parody diluted any suspense, and criticizing the excessive violence.",

    "text": "Some critics said that the film's intelligence and wit beneath the gore would be appreciated by  sophisticated viewers , but Ebert was unsure if the degree of violence was  defused by the ironic way the film uses it and comments on it . Janet Maslin wrote that while Scream offered original ideas for the genre, it quickly exhausted them. John Hartl offered a similar sentiment, believing Scream was so focused on referencing other films that it did not know when to  settle down to tell a coherent story . Bill Stamets considered these references insightful, particularly the killers' motives, saying  Killers without motives are far more scary. Critics such as Berardinelli, Thomas, and Leonard Klady wrote positively of the ensemble cast and their instrumentality in the film's success. Peter Stack and Dave Kehr praised Campbell for her standout performance that successfully carried the central focus on her character, portraying a tough, capable heroine who avoids the  damsel in distress  archetype. While some reviewers appreciated Cox for delivering a strong performance in an against-type role, others criticized her for being unconvincing as a tough and career-obsessed reporter. Thomas and John Hartl wrote that Arquette delivered a  goofily charming  performance.

Thematic analysis\nThemes\nScream is influenced by, and pays many homages to, the history of the horror genre, including a school janitor referencing Freddy Krueger, a cameo appearance by Linda Blair, famed for her appearance in The Exorcist (1973), and the killers admonishing the police for not watching Prom Night for advice. In a meta reference, Randy recounts the rules of the genre: to survive a horror film, characters cannot sin by drinking, taking drugs, or having sex, and they cannot say  'I'll be right back.' Because you won't be back .

Further, Kenny futilely yells at Randy to look behind him while observing via a remote camera. When Sidney confronts Billy and Stu, she says  You've seen one too many movies , to which Billy replies  Movies don't create psychos, movies make psychos more creative. Writer Kate Gardener believed this dialogue rejects the blame on horror films for inspiring real-world violence. Lussier said the MPAA had objected to this dialogue because  you can't speak that kind of truth . Writers Adam White and Michelle Delgado wrote that Scream is an exploration of the  exploitative  nature of the news media using traumatic events as entertainment. The debut of Scream coincided with growing discourse in the United States on the impact of on-screen violence and its potential consequences for society. During this time, the Clinton administration introduced the V-chip, a device designed to enable parents to block mature television content. However, news programs remained exempt from the ratings system, which Delgado said continued to  exploit  violent incidents to captivate audiences.

Although Gale advocates for the innocence of Cotton Weary in Maureen's death, she does so both because she believes he is innocent and to secure a lucrative book deal. While Gale's actions revolve around profiting from the suffering of others, she is depicted not as a villain but a careerist and an antagonist to Sidney who evolves into a heroic figure, aiding in the deaths of Billy and Stu. Gardener wrote that making a living from murder is not morally equal to committing murder, but that it represents the commodification of crime and female trauma. Scream acknowledges the audience's voyeuristic interest in murder and horror, underscoring the monetary value placed on sensationalized crimes. White described Williamson's script as emblematic of its time, featuring a  picture-perfect  mother raped and murdered in American suburbia and the stalking of her daughter one year later. He compared it to contemporary sensationalized cases such as the Murder trial of O. J. Simpson, Lorena Bobbit's assault of her husband, the Long Island Lolita case, and the Gainesville Ripper.

Despite public concerns about the influence of violent media, instances of violent crime were decreasing when Scream was released and there remained no direct link between violent media content and real-life crimes. Even so, public fascination with these media portrayals created a form of celebrity for the victims or perpetrators, with dramatic events being turned into documentaries and films. In Scream, Sidney jokes that a film will be made about the traumatic events of her life and, in the sequels, the film-within-a-film Stab horror series is created, based partly on the events of each preceding Scream entry. Analysis\nAuthor Padraic Maroney wrote that Scream was pro-feminism, depicting several final girls who fight the killer instead of submitting. The success of Scream demonstrated to studios that although typically seen as fare for young males, horror films had an untapped female market. Writer Aime Simon said Sidney, like Craven's Nancy Thompson, is allowed to develop as a character by surviving successive films. The Scream films often explore female trauma through characters such as Sidney and Gale, including the dangers posed by angry males who feel rejected. Gardener said that although this may not have been Craven's intention, the film's narrative effectively conveys this theme.",

She continued that the male killers in Scream enact violence and intimidation primarily on women, including Casey who romantically rejects Stu before the events of the film, and Sidney's mother Maureen, as Billy blames her for the end of his parents' marriage. Maureen is not responsible for his mother leaving, but Billy blames her, takes his anger out on her directly, and then abuses Sidney's emotional vulnerability caused by her death. In this way, the portrayal of Billy and Stu as angry entitled men seeking revenge is more relatable and realistic than supernatural horror villains. Scream has been analyzed for homosexual or queer undertones, influenced by Williamson's own experiences as a gay man. He has expressed how his personal struggles informed Sidney's character because he identified parallels between her survival tactics and those of young gay individuals. In a 2021 interview, he said  as a gay kid, I related to the final girl and to her struggle because it's what one has to do to survive as a young gay kid, too.

Several publications have highlighted the positive response from gay fans of the franchise to these underlying themes. Some writers, such as Maroney, Brant Lewis, and Joe Lipsett, have discussed the theory that Billy and Stu are in a homosexual relationship or that Stu held unrequited feelings for Billy. Professor David Greven wrote that Billy and Stu are representative of the changing notions of masculinity and the underlying currents of queer desire in 90s films. The interactions between them throughout the movie contain themes of homoeroticism, such as when Stu playfully touches Randy's earlobe or leans on Billy during the climax before they stab each other with phallic weapons. Greven believed that although it is easy to assign homosexuality to Stu because of his lack of motive to kill and apparent willingness to please his friend, Billy also features homoerotic characteristics such as the gay trope of fixating on his maternal relationship, similar to Norman Bates in Psycho, and Billy's visual styling resembling actor James Dean, considered a queer icon. Williamson loosely based the characters on Leopold and Loeb, queer individuals who committed murder to prove their intellectual superiority. In a 2022 interview he said he was  very hesitant to present the gay side of me in  Scream   and that any queerness in Billy's and Stu's characters was  a little coded and maybe accidental .",

Legacy\nCultural influence\nIn the decades following its release, Scream has remained an enduringly popular horror film and launched a successful film franchise. It is credited with revitalizing the horror genre, which had significantly declined in popularity by the early 1990s. Far Out and MTV described Scream as a  ground-breaking  slasher film that  successfully crossed over into the mainstream  because of its deft blend of traditional horror with self-aware commentary and satire. Vox wrote that Scream  mainstreamed metatextual storytelling and made that analytical understanding of the genre mainstream in a lot of ways . Studios rushed to capitalize on Scream's success with teen-centric horror films and television series leading into the 2000s, such as I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997), Urban Legend, The Faculty (both 1998), Final Destination, and Cherry Falls (both 2000), as well as sequels to popular, but diminished, franchises such as Halloween H20: 20 Years Later and Bride of Chucky (both 1998).

Scream helped launch or bolster the careers of its principal stars, including Campbell, Ulrich, Lillard, McGowan, Kennedy, and Arquette. Williamson became an in-demand screenwriter, contributing to horror films such as I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997) and television series Dawson's Creek (1998 2003). Scream helped revitalize Craven's career after several career setbacks and a string of poor performances. Lussier credited his work on Scream's opening with his transition to director, beginning with Dracula 2000 (2000). Barrymore's involvement helped raised the profile of the horror genre, making it a more attractive prospect for prominent actors instead of relative unknowns. In a 2021 interview, Kennedy said he was still approached by fans about his horror rules monologue. Lillard described Scream as a  seminal  moment of his career.

Following the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, an increasing media and public scrutiny on the influence of violent films, games, and other media on society the United States Senate Commerce committee reviewed the marketing of films to youths, specifically the horror genre.

The British Film Institute (BFI) called the opening scene  one of the all-time great pre-credit scenes an unforgettable masterclass of building tension, heart-stopping terror, and shocking images . The scene appeared at number 13 on Bravo's 2004 list of the 100 Scariest Movie Moments. Sequels\nDue to the success of Scream, development of a sequel began while the original was still in theaters. Scream 2 (1997) achieved similar financial and critical success as Scream. Williamson was unavailable to write Scream 3 (2000), the trilogy's concluding chapter, and was replaced with Ehren Kruger. The film fared less well than its predecessors, commercially and critically, and is regarded as the franchise's most divisive entry. Williamson returned to the series with the reboot film Scream 4 (2011).",

    "text": "The film fared less well than its predecessors, commercially and critically, and is regarded as the franchise's most divisive entry. Williamson returned to the series with the reboot film Scream 4 (2011). While Scream 4 has been positively reassessed since its release, its modest box office and critical reception on its release, as well as Craven's death, placed the franchise on hold. A television adaptation, Scream (2015 2019), ran for three seasons. The Weinsteins refused to license the Fun World costume for the show or allow references to the films, which was controversial with fans and contributed to the series' low ratings, poor reception, and eventual cancellation. The film series was relaunched with Scream (2022), and its success led to immediate development of a sixth installment, Scream VI (2023). Both films are directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, and written by James Vanderbilt and Guy Busick. These films focus on a younger cast, including Melissa Barrera and Jenna Ortega, with Campbell, Cox, and Arquette appearing in supporting legacy roles. Scream VI was the first film in the series not to feature Campbell, who declined to return following a dispute over pay, or Arquette. Scream 7 began filming in January 2025, with Campbell reprising her role and Kevin Williamson directing.",

While writing the script, Hagins wanted to focus on the transition between adult and child that occurs with Halloween, which she felt was often overlooked in many films. The script was a departure the genre from her previous films, as the dark tones depressed her and Hagins wanted to  a movie that had no genre at all . In 2012 A. J. Bowen was confirmed to be performing in the film. Filming began in mid-November 2012 in Austin, Texas. Hagins experienced some difficulty with shooting, as some businesses already had Christmas decorations up but decided to work them into the script as a plot point. Reception\nCritical reception for Grow Up, Tony Phillips was mostly positive. Common criticisms revolved around the film's storytelling, as some reviewers such as Film School Rejects felt that there were  some serious story elements that are left dangling in all but the most superficial ways , which interfered with a film that they otherwise enjoyed.",

A 1997 article in The New York Times called the campaign  among the longest running and best known ever . In a 2009 article The National Hot Dog and Sausage Council cited statistics indicating that three-quarters of the six million Americans who prefer kosher hot dogs are not themselves Jewish. In 2010, The New York Times wrote that Hebrew National's hot dogs  aren't kosher enough for most Jews who keep kosher . Advertising campaigns\nThe slogan dates back to 1965, and has been used since then as a means to market the product to Jews and non-Jews as a superior product. Some of the campaign's earliest television advertisements, created by Scali, McCabe, Sloves in 1972, featured Uncle Sam preparing to consume a hot dog that includes the additives and fillers permitted under federal regulations, while an ethereal narrator states that Hebrew National cannot, panning up to the heavens and stating because  we answer to a higher authority , and appeared sporadically for nearly two decades. A 1992 revision featured a supposed competitor named  Frank Wiener  who must answer to the higher authority himself for producing inferior products that didn't match the quality of those manufactured by Hebrew National.",

A 1997 campaign developed by New York City firm Grey Advertising featured Robert Klein as an all-knowing hot dog vendor with an ethereally shiny cart, purveying both hot dogs and words of deep wisdom. The campaign played on the nostalgia for the company's earlier television advertisements with a touch of humor. In various spots in the campaign, a single man is guided to his future wife, the finder of a bag full of money is told to return the loot and is rewarded with winning the lottery and a customer who asks if the vendor accepts credit cards is told by the character that  I take credit for everything . The  5 million campaign, double the previous year's budget, would feature ads broadcast in its traditional markets, as well as in cities such as Baltimore, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Arizona and San Francisco, where the products were popular but had not been directly targeted in previous campaigns.

Covering an area of 1,373 ha (3,390 acres) and a maximum depth of 135 m (443 ft), the lake is located in the Lake Sumner Forest Park and on the main stem of the Hurunui River. Several other lakes such as Loch Katrine, Lake Sheppard, Lake Taylor and Lake Mason also lie within the park. The Lake Sumner region is a popular area for hunting, tramping, trout fishing, whitewater kayaking and mountain biking. Several Department of Conservation tramping huts in the region make it a common destination for overnight trips; however, the area's comparatively remote location and difficult vehicle access mean it is seldom crowded. Hoka Kura is a cold inland oligotrophic lake formed approximately 18,000 years ago. It fills a trough 9.7 km (6.0 mi) long by 2.4 km (1.5 mi) wide, within the glacially-carved Hurunui River Valley. The North Branch of the upper Hurunui River enters the lake via a shingle delta at the northwestern end and drains through a narrow natural channel at the southeastern end of the lake.",

This, to the extent that beyond the economic advantages mentioned by the Multinational, there were deep disagreements highlighted by various environmentalists, led by citizen Renzo García, the carnival marcha creator, who stated that in their opinion, the generation of environmental liabilities, the contamination and the destruction of the territory would not have any equivalent in the presumed advantages used by the company.",

He worked as a co-director of the Council of Federated Organizations (COFO), as director of Mississippi's Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), and as one of the organizers of the Mississippi Freedom Summer of 1964. Dennis worked closely with both Bob Moses and Medgar Evers as well as with members of SNCC, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. His first involvement in the Civil Rights Movement was at a Woolworth sit-in organized by CORE and he went on to become a Freedom Rider in 1961. Since 1989, Dennis has put his activism toward the Algebra Project, a nonprofit organization run by Bob Moses that aims to improve mathematics education for minority children. Dennis also speaks publicly about his experiences in the movement through an organization called Dave Dennis Connections. Early life\nDave Dennis was born in 1940 on a plantation of a sharecropper in Omega, Louisiana. All he knew was a life of segregation, he says in one interview with Ebony magazine,  I grew up in this life where you had to stay in your place. Dennis grew up extremely poor, in the Shreveport area where people did not have even the most basic utilities and he did not know what it was like to have these basic utilities until he was nine years old.",

Even after Dennis' family moved to the inner city of Louisiana, black citizens, including his family, were  only able to get basic utilities by entering white territory. He was the first of his family to graduate from high school. He graduated from Southern High School which was connected to Southern University where the beginnings of student protests were forming. Dennis during this time in his life wasn't interested in being a part of any protests or demonstrations, he says,  I didn t have this interest in civil rights that you might think most people are born with . He did not want any part of the civil rights activism,  Things were happening  in the country  and I was trying to run from them . Career\nDave Dennis attended Dillard University in New Orleans and continued to ignore the civil rights protests until he met Doris Castle, who supported the movement, and became involved with the movement through her. She was handing out meeting flyers and speaking to a group of students on campus one afternoon. I thought she was cute, walked over to talk to her after her presentation and, sooner than I realized, agreed to attend a CORE demonstration,  Dennis said. This was Dennis' first demonstration, as part of a sit-in at a Woolworth store in New Orleans.",

Dennis was one of the Freedom Riders to continue the original Freedom Ride from Alabama to Jackson, Mississippi in 1961. The freedom ride was the turning point in his activism. Dennis dropped out of school and started this new path of his life, although he eventually received his Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees from Dillard University and a Juris Doctor from the University of Michigan Law School. Dennis established CORE presence in Mississippi. He helped his local community by setting up a Home Industry Cooperative in Ruleville, which consisted of eighteen local women who made rugs, quilts, and aprons to sell to northern civil rights supporters. Dennis also spent time in Hattiesburg where he met a local woman, Mattie Bivins, whom he married. Dennis was frustrated with CORE's lack of support in Mississippi, however, CORE wasn't pleased with Dennis  strategie. The organization was not pleased because Dennis did not care which organization got the credit for the successes of the movement, yet CORE still valued Dave Dennis. Dennis wanted to establish a voter registration drive in Madison County, Mississippi, as Dennis believed it was an optimal location for a CORE project because Black people made up a majority of the county's population.",

Dennis proposed to CORE that Canton was in close proximity to Tougaloo College, which made it possible to involve college students in the voter registration drive. CORE agreed, but after two years of violence from the police and threats from the Ku Klux Klan, they were unable to organize the Black communities in Madison County. In 1964, Dennis and Moses  plan for the Freedom Summer came to life. Dennis brought in white Northerners to bring national attention to the movement, as he knew that white injuries or deaths would bring more media attention. However, during that summer, a tragedy occurred as three of the Freedom Summer volunteers were killed by the Ku Klux Klan. Dennis was impacted greatly by these deaths because he had worked with the volunteers that were killed, and he was originally supposed to be with them, but was not with them because he had bronchitis. Dennis felt at fault for their deaths, stating  I feel very responsible for Chaney and them...you never get over that. I guess I will live with it until the day I die.

    "text": "The Bluesky Formation is a stratigraphic unit of Lower Cretaceous age in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin. It takes the name from the hamlet of Bluesky, and was first described in Shell's Bluesky No. 1 well by Badgley in 1952. Lithology and Depositional Environment\nThe formation is composed of mudstones, conglomerates and sandstones which can be quartzose or contain chert grains. Many of the Bluesky sandstones do not display bedding features although some low and moderate-angle large scale cross-bedding has been observed in some sections. The sediments were deposited in both marginally marine nearshore and fully marine offshore settings following a transgression of the ancient Moosebar Sea. Bluesky sediments are separated from Gething strata by a scoured or loaded contact and occasionally by a burrowed Glossifungites surface. The Bluesky Formation can be very porous and produces hydrocarbons in many areas across Western Canada. Heavy oil is produced from the Bluesky formation in the Peace River area. Distribution\nThe Bluesky Formation reaches a thickness of 46 meters (151 ft) in the Pouce Coupe area, and thins out toward north and west. Thin sands can be found in the Peace River area. Relationship with other units\nAlthough some early workers included the Bluesky Formation in the Bullhead Group, it is usually classified as the basal unit of the Fort St. John Group.",

It is equivalent with the Glauconitic Sandstone of the Mannville Group in central and southern Alberta, as well as with the Wabiskaw Member of the Clearwater Formation in the eastern part of northern Alberta. Bitumen Deposits\nThe Bluesky deposit of bitumen comes from the  clean estuarine reservoir sands of the Cretaceous-age Bluesky Formation  in the Peace River. Secondary production area is the Gething Formation. The combined Bluesky-Gething deposit is the primary target area for oil sands development in the Peace River area.

It is found tropical moist lowland forest up to 1,000 meters above sea level. It is declining due to habitat loss. Description and taxonomy\nIt is 23 centimetres (9.1 in) long. The black bill is slender and curved and the tail is fairly long and slightly forked. The plumage is mostly glossy blue-black apart from a white bar on the underwing and white marks on the thigh feathers and on the underside of the tail. Young birds are duller than the adults but otherwise similar unlike young Square-tailed drongo-cuckoo which are spotted white. The call is a repeated series of 8 or 9 ascending notes. It belongs to the genus Surniculus along with the Square-tailed drongo-cuckoo (S. lugubris). The two were previously classified as a single species but are now often separated based on differences in calls and juvenile plumage.

    "text": "Sepulana (also sePulane) is the language of the Mapulana people, a low-veld ethnic group primarily located in the Bushbuckridge area, which spans the northeastern Mpumalanga and southeastern Limpopo provinces of South Africa. The language is spoken by an estimated 800,000 people. Sepulana is classified within the Bantu language family, specifically as part of the Sotho-Tswana group, and is considered an Eastern Sotho language, alongside Pai and Kutswe. Historically, Sepulana has been incorrectly regarded as a dialect of Northern Sotho (Sesotho sa Leboa) or Sepedi, a perception stemming from its geographical proximity to the Bapedi people, despite clear linguistic distinctions. This historical miscategorisation has implications for its current status. Sepulana exists predominantly in an unwritten form and is not formally taught in schools. Despite its non-official status, significant community-led efforts are underway for its documentation, revitalisation, and official recognition. Linguistic classification\nSepulana's linguistic classification places it firmly within the broader Bantu language family. It belongs to the Sotho-Tswana group, which corresponds to the S.30 label in Guthrie's 1967 71 classification of Bantu languages. This group encompasses closely related languages such as Setswana, Northern Sotho, Southern Sotho, and Lozi.",

Within the Sotho-Tswana group, linguists classify Sepulana as part of the Eastern Sotho varieties, alongside Pai and Kutswe. These Eastern Sotho varieties are often considered more divergent from the core Northern Sotho dialects. Maho (2002) notably left the  East Sotho  varieties of Kutswe, Pai, and Pulana unclassified within Sotho-Tswana, further emphasizing their distinctiveness from other Sotho-Tswana languages. A significant aspect of Sepulana's linguistic identity is its distinction from Northern Sotho and Sepedi. While it shares some similarities with Sepedi (Northern Sotho), Sepulana is explicitly stated not to be a dialect of Sepedi (Sesotho Sa Leboa). Northern Sotho functions as an umbrella term for a collection of related dialects, with Sepedi being the specific dialect spoken by the Pedi people. The written form of Northern Sotho was largely based on the Sepedi dialect, developed by missionaries in 1860. This historical standardisation process led to  Sepedi  being used as a broader term for the entire language family, even though it is technically just one dialect.",

    "text": "This historical standardisation process led to  Sepedi  being used as a broader term for the entire language family, even though it is technically just one dialect. The historical classification of Sepulana as a mere dialect, particularly during the apartheid era, was a political decision rather than a purely linguistic one, contributing to ongoing debates about its status. This historical imposition has fueled the Mapulana people's ongoing efforts to gain recognition for their language as a sovereign official tongue. The Pan South African Language Board (PanSALB) conducted a survey in 2017 to address the controversy surrounding the names Sepedi and Sesotho sa Leboa, finding that a majority of respondents preferred Sesotho sa Leboa, indicating a broader dissatisfaction with the imposed Sepedi label. This situation underscores the complex interplay between linguistic classification, historical power dynamics, and cultural identity in South Africa. Geographic distribution and demographics\nSepulana is primarily spoken in the Bushbuckridge area, a low-veld region situated near the border of Mpumalanga and Limpopo provinces in South Africa. This area is also known as Mapulaneng, a name that holds deep cultural significance as it directly translates from the Sepulana language to mean  Place of the Mapulana people .",

This direct linguistic link between the place name  Mapulaneng  and the  Mapulana people  and their language  Sepulana  signifies a profound, inherent connection between the community, their ancestral land, and their linguistic identity. The town of Bushbuckridge itself originated around a trading store established in 1884 and was named for the abundant bushbuck herds and a prominent ridge in the 1880s. The Mapulana people are a distinct ethnic group, and their language, Sepulana, is a central component of their cultural identity. The estimated number of native Sepulana speakers is approximately 800,000. The Bushbuckridge Local Municipality serves as the administrative center for this region, which is home to a significant population of Mapulana speakers. The substantial number of speakers, coupled with the language's non-official status, highlights a notable discrepancy in formal recognition for this linguistic community.

    "text": "This unwritten status is a consequence of its historical marginalisation, particularly during the apartheid era when it was classified as a mere dialect rather than a distinct language. Due to its geographical location and the socio-economic interactions of its speakers, Sepulana has been influenced by several other languages. These influences include neighboring indigenous languages such as Swati and Xitsonga (Tsonga). The oral history of the Mapulana people also recounts historical conflicts with Swazis and Shangaans, indicating long-standing interactions that would naturally lead to linguistic exchange. More dominant South African languages, including English and Afrikaans, have also exerted influence. Furthermore, other Sotho-Tswana languages like Sepedi, Setswana, and Southern Sotho (Sesotho) have made inroads into Sepulana. Children in the region often acquire English, Afrikaans, and Sepedi at school, while migrant workers returning home introduce words and phrases from Setswana, Sesotho, and Afrikaans. Despite these influences and the pervasive presence of other languages, Sepulana has retained its unique vocabulary and linguistic features, distinguishing it from other Sotho languages. However, the absence of a standardized written form and formal education, coupled with the pervasive influence of other languages and the active discouragement of Sepulana in educational settings, collectively pose a significant threat to the language's vitality.",

    "text": "However, the absence of a standardized written form and formal education, coupled with the pervasive influence of other languages and the active discouragement of Sepulana in educational settings, collectively pose a significant threat to the language's vitality. Studies indicate that the use of Sepulana by first-language speakers can negatively impact their learning of Sepedi, the standardised language taught in schools. Subject advisors have actively discouraged the use of Sepulana in classrooms, asserting that only Sepedi, as the official language, should be used, and often dismissing Sepulana as  not a language but a dialect . This perspective has been criticized for its bias and for disregarding the principle that all language varieties can be promoted and developed. Within the Mapulana community, some sub-dialects, such as HiPaye (spoken by the Mambayi subgroup), are facing extinction, with very few speakers remaining. This decline reflects the broader challenges to language transmission and survival. Orthography and phonology\nCurrently, Sepulana exists primarily in an unwritten form, meaning there is no widely adopted or standardized writing system for the language. The existing written form for Northern Sotho, with which Sepulana is sometimes erroneously associated, was standardized using the Latin alphabet.",

This orthography was developed by missionaries in 1860, largely based on the Sepedi dialect, and employs specific conventions for sounds, such as 'š' for the  ʃ  sound and circumflex accents to distinguish certain vowel sounds. In response to the need for a more linguistically efficient writing system for highly agglutinative Southern African languages, including Eastern Sotho languages like Sepulana that currently lack standardized Latin orthographies, a new ideographic writing system called Ditema tsa Dinoko has been developed. The emergence of Ditema tsa Dinoko, an ideographic writing system specifically designed for Eastern Sotho languages such as Sepulana, represents a proactive, community-aligned initiative to address the historical absence of a written form for these languages. This system aims to remedy the  slowness in reading  often associated with the numerous multigraphs used in Latin scripts for these languages. Ditema tsa Dinoko is characterized as a syllabary, where individual graphemes representing consonants, vowels, and featural elements are combined into syllabic blocks known as amabheqe. The positioning of consonant graphemes within this system often corresponds to their place of articulation (e.g., labials at the apex, alveolars across the middle).",

It also incorporates specific markers for articulatory mode, such as Uphimbo (a voicing line), Lerothodi (a glottal action dot), and Ingungwana (a nasalization marker). Like other Bantu languages, Sepulana is expected to exhibit agglutinative morphology, meaning it uses numerous affixes and derivational inflectional rules to construct complete words. Bantu languages typically feature complex noun class and concord systems. Northern Sotho, for instance, is a non-articled language. Academic studies on the core vocabulary and morphological structures, such as compound words, in Sepedi provide insights into the grammatical characteristics shared across related Sotho-Tswana languages. Documentation and revitalization efforts\nSignificant community-led initiatives and partnerships are actively engaged in documenting, preserving, and promoting the Sepulana language, aiming to counteract its historical marginalization. A pivotal organization in these efforts is the Mapulaneng Writers' Association (MWA). The MWA serves as an advocacy and lobby group dedicated to Mapulana culture, history, and language.

Mashego is a vocal advocate for the recognition of all indigenous languages in South Africa. Another key initiative is the Sepulana Bible Translation Project, a collaborative endeavor involving Wycliffe SA, the Church of the Nazarene, and the Mapulaneng Writers' Association. This project's primary goal is the oral Bible translation and transcription of the New Testament into Sepulana. Phase 1 of the project successfully completed the oral Bible translation of 40 narratives from both the Old and New Testaments, as well as an oral and written translation of the Gospel of Mark. The team is currently in Phase 2, focusing on the translation of the Gospel of Matthew. The project receives support from various sources, including funding from organizations like Johannesburg Waste Management Company. Community members, such as Itireleng Florence Chiloane, a retired teacher and curriculum implementer, play an active role as reviewers, demonstrating the strong local commitment to the project.

A significant achievement in these efforts occurred in 2018 when a government entity agreed to use Sepulana in official signage, providing formal visibility for the language. This struggle for recognition is part of a broader movement across South Africa, where various indigenous nations, including the Balobedu and AmaHlubi, are seeking official recognition for their languages. Community engagement is a vital component of these revitalization efforts. Song-writing workshops have been organised with the Mapulana community to create worship songs based on the translated scriptures, thereby integrating the language with cultural and religious practices. These initiatives align with broader language preservation strategies that emphasize community-based programs, cultural events, and the integration of traditional knowledge with language learning. The multi-faceted approach to Sepulana revitalisation, encompassing literary publications, religious translations, and political lobbying, demonstrates a comprehensive and strategic community-led effort to secure the language's future and counteract historical marginalisation. The ultimate aim is to empower indigenous communities to lead their own revitalisation efforts, potentially leveraging technological advancements such as app development to teach younger generations.

The Mapulana (or Pulana) are a low-veld ethnic group whose name is believed to be derived from their founding leader, Lepulana, who later adopted the name Chiloane. Their historical origins can be traced back to the Kgalagadi, from where they settled in Thaba Chueu, in what is now eastern Lesotho, and Shakwaneng (Carolina) during the 1500s. Research indicates that the Mapulana people comprise three main ancestral groups: the Mapulana of Mohlomi, who are of Bakwena origin; the Mapulana of Matshwe I, of Pulane, who are of Amazizi (Nguni) origin and previously resided along the Tugela River before joining other Mapulana at Thaba Chueu; and the Mapulana of Chiloane, who are of Barolong (Setswana) origin and separated from the main Barolong tribe during the reign of Tau.

Historically, the Mapulana of Chiloane inhabited Phageng (Empakeni) and the Lepunama River area (Nelspruit), while the Mapulana of Mashego lived at Motsheteng (Emjindini, Barberton). The Mapulana people maintain distinct traditional beliefs and practices that are deeply intertwined with their language. Like most Sotho-Tswana groups, they venerate Badimo (ancestors). Ancestral acknowledgement ceremonies, known as go phasa badimo, involve facing east towards Shakwaneng, pouring traditional beer and animal blood on a sacrificial platform (legandelo), and ritually calling out the names of ancestors according to hierarchy. The Mmalo (Coral) tree is commonly planted on these sacrificial platforms. Traditional medicine is a recognised specialty among the Mapulana, a practice facilitated by the abundance of medicinal herbs in the subtropical climate of Mapulaneng. Traditional doctors, or Dingaka, undergo rigorous and lengthy training under a Gobela (Guru), with trainees referred to as letwasane (Sangoma). Rainmaking was also a notable specialty of the Mapulana, with the tribe's name itself possibly linked to their rain-making capabilities or the Lepunama (White) River.",

The Mapulana also practice initiation rites for their youth, marking the transition into womanhood and manhood. These initiation schools (koma) are held during the winter months. Boys who undergo initiation together form a mphato or moroto (regiment), with an elaborate system in place to distinguish regiments based on their initiation year. The rich tapestry of Mapulana cultural practices and their diverse ancestral origins clearly demonstrate that Sepulana is not merely a linguistic code but a fundamental, living component of a complex cultural heritage. The vitality of Sepulana is directly linked to the continuity of these cultural practices, as the language serves as the primary vehicle for transmitting oral histories, performing rituals, teaching traditional medicine, and conducting initiation ceremonies. Its preservation is therefore crucial for the continuity of Mapulana identity and the unique knowledge systems embedded within their traditions. The Mapulana share borders and have had historical interactions with several neighboring tribes, including the AmaSwazi to the south, the Mahlanganu Tsongas to the east, the Bapedi baSekhukhune and Bakone to the west, and the Banareng and Batokwa to the north.

    "text": "Guan Zhong (Chinese: 管仲; Wade Giles: Kuan Chung; c. 720 645 BC) was a Chinese philosopher and politician. He served as chancellor and was a reformer of the State of Qi during the Spring and Autumn period of Chinese history. His given name was Yiwu (Chinese: 夷吾; pinyin: Yíwú). Zhong was his courtesy name. He is mainly remembered for his reforms as chancellor under Duke Huan of Qi, as well as his friendship with his colleague Bao Shuya, though his reputation remained controversial among the Confucians, as detailed in the appraisal section. Through Guan Zhong's reforms and skilful diplomacy Qi became the most powerful of the feudal states and Duke Huan became the first of the Five Hegemons. Though knowledge of his reforms is limited, in particular he instituted a famous fiscal policy known as  balancing the light and the heavy , associated with salt and iron monopolies. Otherwise a diverse work, the Guanzi compilation making use of his name makes similar such recommendations. Life\nYouth and friendship with Bao Shuya\nGuan Zhong, a descendant of either Shu Xian of Guan or King Mu of Zhou, was born in Yingshang, and became acquainted with Bao Shuya at an early age, when they became business partners.",

Bao, however, recognised his impoverished background and was not offended. Tutors of different princes\nSubsequently, Guan Zhong was appointed tutor to Prince Jiu, the younger brother of the ruling Duke Xiang of Qi. Bao Shuya, meanwhile, became tutor to Jiu's younger brother, Prince Xiaobai. In 686 BC, Duke Xiang was murdered in a palace coup by two of his ministers, who then installed Gongsun Wuzhi, a scion of the ducal house, as the new Duke. Recognising that they were in mortal danger, both Prince Jiu and Prince Xiaobai fled with their respective tutors. Prince Jiu fled to the State of Lu, while Prince Xiaobai went to the State of Ju. Becoming chancellor\nIn 685 BC, Gongsun Wuzhi himself was killed in another palace coup, and the ministers of Qi sent envoys to Ju, hoping to receive Prince Xiaobai back and succeed to the duchy. On hearing of this, Lu also sent Prince Jiu towards Qi, while Guan Zhong intercepted Prince Xiaobai to prevent his return. In the resulting conflict, Guan Zhong shot an arrow at Xiaobai which hit his belt buckle.",

    "text": "In the resulting conflict, Guan Zhong shot an arrow at Xiaobai which hit his belt buckle. Xiaobai pretended to cough blood and collapse, tricking Guan Zhong into thinking he was mortally wounded. Eventually, Xiaobai won the race back to Qi, and was installed as Duke. The State of Lu attempted to enforce Prince Jiu's claim, but was defeated in battle, after which Qi forced Lu to execute Prince Jiu and send Guan Zhong back as a prisoner. Xiaobai originally wanted to execute Guan Zhong as well, but Bao Shuya strongly recommended sparing him and elevating him to chancellor, even though that meant he would outrank Bao himself. Xiaobai was eventually convinced. Domestic reforms\nDuke Huan had inherited a state in turmoil, after three years of civil wars and usurpation had severely depleted the treasury. As Chancellor, Guan Zhong instituted extensive reforms aimed at organising and strengthening the Qi state. Administratively, the capital was divided into 21 districts: six of merchants, which provided the Qi state's trade revenue, and fifteen of attendants, which provided the core of the Qi army. Similarly, the population outside the capital was organised: 30 households were formed into one village, 10 villages as one troop, 10 troops as one district, 3 districts as one county, and counties grouped into five regions.",

Administrators were appointed at every level, with the regional administrators reporting on their jurisdictions to the Duke every year. Economically, Guan Zhong disbanded the well-field system instituted since the Zhou dynasty; instead, all land was to be taxed according to its productivity. At the same time, Qi's coastal position was exploited through the expansion of fisheries and salt production, while trade was encouraged through certain privileges. For instance, people bearing goods to market on foot, and carriages arriving empty at markets to make purchases, were not subject to tolls; this encouraged the use of the state-managed markets. Guan Zhong wrote that because taxation would reduce the people's wealth and make them dislike the government, it was better to obtain revenue by monopolizing the sale of salt, iron, forest products, and ore. Thus, these  goods of the mountains and seas  (namely iron and salt) should be state managed. Similarly, a price-regulation scheme existed for food, with granaries buying grain in bounty years to be released into the market in lean years. Finally, coinage was also unified to encourage trade within Qi.",

Finally, coinage was also unified to encourage trade within Qi. Appraisal\nGuan Zhong would ultimately be identified with the Legalist school as a result of his administrative reforms. Though actually legalistic philosophy did not develop until hundreds of years later, R. Eno of Indiana University does consider that  If one were to trace the origins of Legalism as far back as possible, it might be appropriate to date its beginnings to the prime ministership of Guan Zhong, chief aide to the first of the hegemonic lords of the Spring Autumn period, Duke Huan of Qi (r. 685 643). He is said to have indulged in a luxurious lifestyle, and did not equate a ruler's moral purity with his ability to govern. Duke Huan, who loved hunting and women, asked Guan if these indulgences would harm his hegemony, to which Guan replied that the ruler's love for luxury would not harm his hegemony. It would only be harmed through inappropriate staffing and misuse of talent. One passage  recounts  Confucius as considering him  mediocre  for his lack of frugality and knowledge of ritual. Despite all this, he might be considered,  at least in most respects  an  ideal Confucian minister .",

So long as your virtuous conduct and courtesy never falter, there will be no one who does not cherish you.'  When Duke Huan was approached to dethrone the ruling clans of his state, Guan Zhong advised him that he had won their adherence through politeness (li) and trustworthiness (xin). When Confucius's students criticized Guan Zhong as lacking propriety, crediting his ambition and achievement Confucius said of him that  It was due to Guan Zhong that Duke Huan was able to assemble the feudal lords on numerous occasions without resorting to the use of his war chariots. Such was his goodness! ... Through having Guan Zhong as his minister Duke Huan became protector over the feudal lords.

The students of Confucius also posted a question whether Guan Zhong followed Ren (Confucian humaneness) or not. However, in pre-Qin period,  Ren  has a distinctive utilitarian definition. Hence, from this standpoint, Guan Zhong followed  Ren . Achievements\nGuan Zhong started multiple reforms in the State of Qi. Politically, he centralized power and divided the state into different villages, each carrying out a specific trade. Instead of relying on the traditional aristocracy for manpower, he applied levies to the village units directly. He also developed a better method for choosing talent to be governors. Under Guan Zhong, Qi shifted administrative responsibility from hereditary aristocrats to professional bureaucrats. He is also credited for creating the first official government sponsored brothel known as  女市  which funded the government treasury. During his term of office, the State of Qi became much stronger. The Zuo Zhuan records that in 660 BC, Guan Zhong urged Duke Huan of Qi to attack the small neighboring State of Xing which was under attack from Quan Rong nomads, a non-Chinese Rong tribes.",

Duke Huan often listened to Guan Zhong's sound advice such that his status amongst other Zhou vassal states rose. As a result, the duke came to be recognized as the first Hegemon or leader of the vassal alliance. In recognition of Guan Zhong's service, Duke Huan gave him the honorary title of  Godfather  (仲父). The same title was later given to Lü Buwei by Prince Zheng, the future Qin Shi Huang. State Monopoly on Salt and Iron\nUnder Guan's guidance several important economic reforms were introduced. He created a uniform tax code and also used state power to encourage the production of salt and iron. He believed that monopolizing the nature resources was helpful on improving the government income, with fewer complaints from the public than raising taxes. The strategy was described by himself to the Duke of Huan as  managing the mountain and the sea 官山海) , which mainly refers to iron mine from the mountain and salt from the sea. Under his policy, private business who produce salt by boiling seawater and iron by mining must sell all outputs to the government, and the government resell refined salt and iron products, with huge price gap, to all household in State of Qi.",

Qi-Hengshan War\nIn the record of Guanzi Chapter 84, Duke of Huan wanted to restrain the threat from State of Hengshan (衡山国) and asked Guan for solution. State of Hengshan was famous for its weapon production. Guan then ordered officials to buy arms from State of Hengshan in large quantities. After ten months, worrying that the price will continuously grow up, State of Yan, State of Dai and later State of Qin followed up the buying. The price then jumped sharply and, as a result, almost all household in State of Hengshan switched to make weapons instead of farming. One year later, Guan ordered officials to buy rice from State of Zhao, at a price more than three times higher than normal. By seeing the potential huge profit, State of Hengshan sold its rice inventory to officials from State of Qi. Afterwards, Guan suddenly ordered State of Qi's army to invade State of Hengshan. With selling out of weapon and rice, State of Hengshan soon surrendered. Some historians marked Qi-Hengshan War the early form of Economic Warfare.",

    "text": "Indoor bonsai are bonsai cultivated for the indoor environment. Traditionally, bonsai are temperate climate trees grown outdoors in containers. Tropical and sub-tropical tree species can be cultivated to grow and thrive indoors, with some suited to bonsai aesthetics shaped as traditional outdoor or wild bonsai. Bonsai and related practices, like penjing, hòn non bộ, and saikei, involve the long-term cultivation of small trees and landscapes in containers. The term bonsai is generally used in English as an umbrella term for all miniature trees in containers or pots. Indoor vs. traditional bonsai\nIndoor bonsai is the cultivation of an attractive, healthy plant in the artificial environment of indoors rather than using an outdoor climate, as may occur in traditional bonsai. Indoor penjing is the cultivation of miniature landscapes in a pot or tray, possibly with rocks, bonsai trees, and ground covers, and sometimes with small objects or figurines. Bonsai vs. other forms of house plant\nCompared to the usual potted house plant, bonsai are rooted in a much smaller amount of soil. Consequently, they require more frequent watering and feeding. This form is therefore best suited for drought-resistant species. Compared to usual house gardening, bonsais require a lot more pruning, both of branches and roots. Cultivation and care\nMany of the techniques used to grow and shape outdoor bonsai apply equally to indoor bonsai.",

Cultivation and care\nMany of the techniques used to grow and shape outdoor bonsai apply equally to indoor bonsai. For example, shaping techniques like pruning, wiring, and grafting work much the same for both types of bonsai. But indoor bonsai also have some special requirements for cultivation and care. Lighting\nAn indoor room comfortably lit for human use provides too little light for most species of tree to grow. Few species will thrive with less than 500 lux available several hours per day. Successful indoor bonsai cultivation requires either selecting from the short list of low-light-tolerant trees, or providing additional lighting for the trees. Insufficient light may not kill some species outright, but will make their growth so slow that the bonsai shaping techniques cannot be used: the plant will not grow back after pruning or leaf trimming. The simplest way to provide extra light is to place the bonsai close to an outside window. Care is taken not to harm the plant either with cold air entering through the window, or with high radiated heat from direct exposure to the sun. More controllable light, and more flexibility in situating the bonsai, can be obtained using artificial lighting. Fluorescent lighting (preferably with bulbs radiating growth-friendly spectra) and light-emitting diode lighting can give sufficient light to support a significant number of indoor bonsai species.",

These lights also have the advantage of blending with other indoor lighting, so that the plants can be grown in normal living quarters. For plants needing the highest amount of light, or for large numbers of bonsai being maintained indoors, a space dedicated to bonsai cultivation can support high-intensity lamps and optionally the special ventilation or cooling often needed for their use. Temperature\nSuitable temperatures for indoor bonsai extend from standard room temperature downward. The best temperature range for a tree is determined by its species and, less directly, by its normal range in the wild. Tropical trees are usually tolerant of room temperature year-round but cannot tolerate temperatures approaching freezing, as might occur near an open window in cold weather. Semi-tropical and Mediterranean-climate trees often grow better when temperatures drop well below room temperature during winter months. The lower temperature, combined with shorter periods of daylight, triggers an expected annual dormancy which many non-tropical species need in order to thrive. These non-tropical trees need a cool location in the winter, such as a cool window ledge or  cold room  area in the house. In addition to the need for seasonal temperature variation, many non-tropicals grow better when there is a distinct difference between day temperatures (warm) and night (cooler).",

Humidity\nIndoor conditions, particularly in homes outside the tropics, imply very low humidity. Both air conditioning and room heating reduce air humidity significantly. Some tree species, such as ficus sp. with their waxy leaves, are tolerant of low humidity. Many species, however, require additional humidification to survive indoors. As with lighting, some humidification solutions can be integrated into the regular living area and some require a dedicated space. Local humidity can be raised by locating the bonsai containers over a tray of water, or by placing them in a bed of dampened sand. For better effect, the bonsai can be placed in enclosures, such as terrariums, that are humidified from within. For the maximum humidity, a dedicated room with high-capacity evaporative or misting humidifiers can support the most sensitive bonsai. Plants suitable for indoor bonsai\nTropical\nThe creation of bonsai is limited only by the imagination and talent of the gardener, although some species are much more suitable than others.

From 1964, he worked full-time for the union, and he was elected as its general secretary in 1975. In 1982, Lambert changed roles to become the general president of the NUHKW. He led the union into a merger which formed the National Union of Knitwear, Footwear and Apparel Trades (KFAT), and continued as general president of the new union until 1994. In 1988, his description of the closure of the apparently viable Mansfield Knitwear Company -as like amputating the torso of the industry at a stroke- was referenced by Alan Meale in an adjournment debate where he criticised the dumping of cheap knitwear in the UK.

    "text": "Essence of Decision: Explaining the Cuban Missile Crisis is book by political scientist Graham T. Allison analyzing the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Allison used the crisis as a case study for future studies into governmental decision-making. The book became the founding study of the John F. Kennedy School of Government, and in doing so revolutionized the field of international relations. Allison originally published the book in 1971. In 1999, because of new materials available (including tape recordings of the U.S. government's proceedings), he rewrote the book with Philip Zelikow. The title is based on a speech by John F. Kennedy, in which he said,  The essence of ultimate decision remains impenetrable to the observer - often, indeed, to the decider himself. Thesis\nWhen he first wrote the book, Allison contended that political science and the study of international relations were saturated with rational expectations theories inherited from the field of economics. Under such a view, the actions of states are analyzed by assuming that nations consider all options and act rationally to maximize their utility. Allison attributes such viewpoints to the dominance of economists such as Milton Friedman, statesmen such as Robert McNamara and Henry Kissinger, disciplines such as game theory, and organizations such as the RAND Corporation.",

However, as he puts it:\nIt must be noted, however, that an imaginative analyst can construct an account of value-maximizing choice for any action or set of actions performed by a government. Or, to put it bluntly, this approach (which Allison terms the  Rational Actor Model ) violates the principle of falsifiability. Also, Allison notes that  rational  analysts must ignore a lot of facts in order to make their analysis fit their models. In response, Allison constructed three different ways (or  lenses ) through which analysts can examine events: the  Rational Actor  model, the  Organizational Behavior  model, and the  Governmental Politics  model. To illustrate the models, Allison poses the following three questions in each section:\nWhy did the Soviet Union decide to place offensive missiles in Cuba? Why did the United States respond to the missile deployment with a blockade? Why did the Soviet Union withdraw the missiles? Models\nThe  Rational Actor  Model\nThe origin of Allison's first model is explained above. Basically, under this theory:\nGovernments are treated as the primary actor.

The government examines a set of goals, evaluates them according to their utility, then picks the one that has the highest  payoff. Under this theory, Allison explains the crisis like this:\nJohn F. Kennedy, in 1961, revealed that the Soviet Union, despite rhetoric, had far fewer ICBMs than it claimed. In response, Nikita Khrushchev ordered nuclear missiles with shorter ranges installed in Cuba. In one move, the Soviets bridged the  missile gap  while scoring points in the Cold War. Based on Kennedy's failure to back up the Bay of Pigs Invasion, they believed the U.S. wouldn't respond harshly. Kennedy and his advisors (EXCOMM) evaluated a number of options, ranging from doing nothing to a full invasion of Cuba. A blockade of Cuba was chosen because it wouldn't necessarily escalate into war, and because it forced the Soviets to make the next move. Because of mutually assured destruction by a nuclear war, the Soviets had no choice but to bow to U.S. demands and remove the weapons. Allison guessed that Kennedy must have made an  under the table  agreement concerning American nuclear missiles in Turkey. The American tapes released following 1993 confirmed this and the missiles were quietly removed from Turkey a few years after the crisis.",

The  Organizational Process  Model\nAllison noted there were many facts that the rational model had to ignore, such as why the Soviets failed to camouflage the nuclear sites during construction, but did so only after U-2 flights pinpointed their locations. He cited work by James G. March and Herbert A. Simon, which argue that existing governmental bureaucracy places limits on a nation's actions, and often dictates the outcome. He then proposed the following  organizational process  model propositions:\nWhen faced with a crisis, government leaders don't look at it as a whole, but break it down and assign it according to pre-established organizational lines. Because of time and resource limitations, rather than evaluating all possible courses of action to see which one is most likely to work, leaders settle on the first proposal that adequately addresses the issue, which Simon termed  satisficing. Leaders gravitate towards solutions that limit short-term uncertainty (emphasis on  short-term ). Organizations follow set  repertoires  and procedures when taking actions. Because of the large resources and time required to fully plan and mobilize actions within a large organization (or government), leaders are effectively limited to pre-existing plans.",

Under this theory, the crisis is explained thus:\nBecause the Soviets never established nuclear missile bases outside of their country at the time, they assigned the tasks to established departments, which in turn followed their own set procedures. However, their procedures were not adapted to Cuban conditions, and as a result, mistakes were made that allowed the U.S. to quite easily learn of the program's existence. Such mistakes included such gaffes as supposedly undercover Soviet troops decorating their barracks with Red Army Stars viewable from above. Alternatively, the secrecy may have been the gaffe, stoking American fears unnecessarily. Kennedy and his advisors never really considered any other options besides a blockade or air strikes, and initially, were almost unanimously in favor of the air strikes. However, such attacks created massive uncertainty because the U.S. Air Force couldn't guarantee it would disable all the nuclear missiles. Additionally, although Kennedy wanted a  surgical  air strike that would destroy the missiles without inflicting extensive damage, the existing Air Force plan required extensive bombing that would have created more collateral damage than Kennedy desired.

Because the U.S. Navy already had considerable strength in the field, because there was a pre-existing plan in place for a blockade, and because Kennedy was able to communicate directly with the fleet's captains, members fell back on the blockade as the only safe option. The Soviets simply did not have a plan to follow if the U.S. took decisive action against their missiles. Khrushchev's communications indicated a high degree of desperation. Without any back-up plan, the Soviets had to withdraw. The  Bureaucratic Politics  Model\nAfter reading works by Richard Neustadt and Samuel P. Huntington, among others, Allison proposed a third model, which takes account of court politics (or palace politics). While statesmen don't like to admit they play politics to get things done, especially in high-stakes situations such as the Cuban missile crisis, they nonetheless do. Allison proposed the following propositions for this model:\nA nation's actions are best understood as the result of politicking and negotiation by its top leaders. Even if they share a goal, leaders differ in how to achieve it because of such factors as personal interests and background.",

Even if a leader holds absolute power (e.g., the President of the United States is technically the commander-in-chief), the leader must gain a consensus with his underlings or risk having his order misunderstood or, in some cases, ignored. Related to the above proposition, the make-up of a leader's entourage will have a large effect on the final decision (i.e., an entourage of  yes men  will create a different outcome than a group of advisors who are willing to voice disagreement). Leaders have different levels of power based on charisma, personality, skills of persuasion, and personal ties to decision-makers. If a leader is certain enough, they will not seek input from their advisors, but rather, approval. Likewise, if a leader has already implicitly decided on a particular course of action, an advisor wishing to have influence must work within the framework of the decision the leader has already made. If a leader fails to reach a consensus with his inner circle (or, at least, the appearance of a consensus), opponents may take advantage of these disagreements. Therefore, effective leaders must create a consensus. Because of the possibilities of miscommunication, misunderstandings, and downright disagreements, different leaders may take actions that the group as a whole would not approve of.",

Allison had to admit that, because the Soviets were not as open with their internal affairs as the Americans, he simply didn't have enough data to fully interpret the crisis with this model. Nonetheless, he made the following attempt:\nKhrushchev came under increasing fire from the Presidium because of Kennedy's revelation of the Soviet lack of ICBMs, as well as American successes in the Berlin Airlift. Also, the Soviet economy was being stretched, and military leaders were unhappy with Khrushchev's decision to cut the size of the Red Army. Placing missiles in Cuba was a cheap and quick way for him to secure his political base. Because of the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion, Republicans in the Congress made Cuban policy into a major issue for the upcoming congressional elections later in 1962. Therefore, Kennedy immediately decided on a strong response rather than a diplomatic one. Although a majority of EXCOMM initially favored air strikes, those closest to the president - such as his brother and Attorney General, Robert F. Kennedy, and special counsel Theodore Sorensen - favored the blockade. At the same time, Kennedy got into arguments with proponents of the air strikes, such as Air Force General Curtis LeMay.",

In order to avoid appearing weak to the hawkish members of EXCOMM, Kennedy rejected the purely diplomatic proposals of United States Ambassador to the United Nations Adlai Stevenson. This combination of push and pull led to a consensus for the implication of a blockade. With his plans thwarted, Khrushchev tried to save face by pointing to American missiles in Turkey, a position similar to the Cuban missiles. While Kennedy refused to move these missiles  under duress,  he allowed Robert Kennedy to reach a deal with Soviet ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin, in which the Turkish missiles would be quietly removed several months later. Publicly, Kennedy also agreed never to invade Cuba. Implications\nWhen the book was first published, Allison's primary message was that the concept of mutually assured destruction as a barrier to nuclear war was unfounded. By looking at organizational and political models, such an outcome was quite possible - nations, against what was predicted by the rational viewpoint, could indeed  commit suicide. He pointed to several incidents in history that seemed to back this assertion.",

    "text": "By looking at organizational and political models, such an outcome was quite possible - nations, against what was predicted by the rational viewpoint, could indeed  commit suicide. He pointed to several incidents in history that seemed to back this assertion. His most salient point: prior to the attack at Pearl Harbor, Japanese military and civilian leaders, including those responsible for making the decision, were fully aware that they lacked the industrial capacity and military might to win a war against the U.S. They went ahead and attacked anyway. He also believed that the organizational model explained otherwise inexplicable gaffes in military history. To return to 1941, he noted that the U.S. intercepted enough evidence to indicate that Japan was about to attack Pearl Harbor, yet the commander did not prepare. The answer, Allison revealed, was not some conspiracy, but that what the intelligence community viewed as a  threat of attack,  the commander interpreted as a  threat of sabotage. This miscommunication, due to different viewpoints, allowed the attack to be pulled off successfully - as Allison sarcastically noted, having U.S. planes lined up wing-to-wing and surrounded by armed guards was a good plan for preventing sabotage, but not for surviving an aerial attack. Likewise, the political process model explained otherwise confusing affairs. Allison pointed to the decision by General Douglas MacArthur to defy his orders during the Korean War and march too far north. The reason was not a  rational  change in U.S.",

    "text": "Likewise, the political process model explained otherwise confusing affairs. Allison pointed to the decision by General Douglas MacArthur to defy his orders during the Korean War and march too far north. The reason was not a  rational  change in U.S. intentions, but rather, MacArthur's disagreements with Harry Truman and other policymakers, and how officials allowed MacArthur to make what they considered unwise moves because of concerns over political backlash due to the general's public popularity. Above all, he described using rational actor models as dangerous. By using such models (and modes of thinking), people made unreliable assumptions about reality, which could have disastrous consequences. Part of what allowed the attack on Pearl Harbor to be pulled off was the assumption that, since Japan would lose such a war, they would never dare attack. The assumption under MAD is that nobody will ever start a nuclear war because of its consequences. However, humans are not inextricably bound to act in a rational manner, which history has proven time and time again. While Allison did not claim that any of his additional two models could fully explain anything, he noted that policymakers and analysts alike would benefit from stepping away from the traditional model and exploring alternate viewpoints (although this last remark could be viewed as facetious on Allison's part).

    "text": "Criticism\nThe book is part of an ongoing argument between supporters of rational expectations theories and analysts who look for alternative explanations. Moreover, Allison pointed out that the  rational actor  model continues to be applied even in long-term analyses (i.e., analyses that take place long after the event or  crisis  is past). In Essence of Decision, Allison suggests that one reason for the popularity of rational actor models is that, compared to other models, they require relatively little data and provide researchers with an  inexpensive approximation  of the situation. Allison also quotes Thomas Schelling's description of rationalistic thinking and vicarious problem solving:\nYou can sit in your armchair and try to predict how people will behave by asking how you would behave if you had your wits around you. You get, free of charge, a lot of vicarious, empirical behavior. Finally, in Allison's first edition (1971), he was unable to fully explore his theories because much of the information was still classified. As a result, he made a number of assumptions on his own part. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the release of American recordings of EXCOMM, this new information (included in the revised 1999 edition) sometimes agreed with Allison's assumptions, but sometimes didn't. For example, in 1971, Allison guessed that Kennedy must have made an  under the table  agreement concerning the Turkish missiles, probably using his brother as a liaison. The American tapes confirmed this.",

Locally referred to as the Portuguese Capital of Olive Oil, Vila Flor is located in the Terra Quente Transmontana, in the southern part of the district of Bragança. The population in 2011 was 6,697, in an area of 265.81 square kilometres (102.63 mi2). History\nIt was King Denis who, while travelling through the burg (then known as Póvoa d Álem Sabor, became enchanted by the local landscape and, in 1286, renamed the district Vila Flor. Around 1295, the King ordered the construction of a walled city, consisting of five gates, to protect the fledgling settlement and guard Portuguese interests in the territory. During the Middle Ages, this bouquet of flowers, as Cabral Adão (1910, in Vila Flor - 1992, in Almada), Vila Flor-born stomatology doctor and writer, once called it, became the home to many fleeing Jewish families, who settled in the territory to start farms and businesses of small industry (such as tanneries and jewelers). King Manuel eventually conferred on the settlement an official charter (foral), later to be reformulated in May 1512.",

Economy\nRich in history, tradition, monuments and citizenry, the municipality is also an important reference for agriculture, owing to the fertility of the Vilariça Valley (Vale da Vilariça).

Taxonomy\nThe species was first described by Joseph Maiden in 1920 as Acacia havilandi, despite the specific epithet honouring both Edwin Haviland and his son, who   specialised in the fertilisation of Australian plants and (have) also worked at taxonomy and other branches of botany  The epithet was changed to a genitive plural (havilandiorum) to accord with ICN Art. 60.8 (Shenzhen Code, 2018). Distribution\nThe plant has a scattered and discontinuous distribution from as far west as the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia where it is common, to further north in the Flinders Range through to Griffith and Cobar but the range extends as far as Gilgandra in the east. It is only known around Horsham in the north west region of Victoria.

Its strength can often be varied by usage of electromagnets. Magnetic lenses are used in diverse applications, from cathode ray tubes over electron microscopy to particle accelerators. Design\nA magnetic lens typically consists of several electromagnets arranged in a quadrupole (see quadrupole magnet), sextupole, or higher format; the electromagnetic coils are placed at the vertices of a square or another regular polygon. From this configuration a customized magnetic field can be formed to manipulate the particle beam. The passing particle is subjected to two vector forces \n \n \n \n \n H\n \n Z\n \n \n \n \n   displaystyle H_ Z  \n \n (parallel to the core), and \n \n \n \n \n H\n \n R\n \n \n \n \n   displaystyle H_ R  \n \n (parallel to the radius of the lens). H\n \n R\n \n \n \n \n   displaystyle H_ R  \n \n causes the particle to spiral through the lens, and this spiraling expose the electron to \n \n \n \n \n H\n \n Z\n \n \n \n \n   displaystyle H_ Z  \n \n which in turn focus the electron. Note that the magnetic field is inhomogeneous, particles close to the center are less strongly deflected than those passing the lens far from the axis.",

At age six, Orrico wrote her first song, entitled  Always Answer . She also attended missionary school with singer Allen Stone. Career\n1999 2001: Early work and debut album\nOrrico got her start at the age of 13, by attending a Christian music festival, Praise in the Rockies, held in her then-home state of Colorado. Orrico inadvertently entered a high-stakes talent competition, and won. A ForeFront Records executive was on hand and approached her for a record deal. She later signed with them. In 2001, she toured with Destiny's Child as their opening act on select dates of their Survivor tour in the United States. She went on to release two albums.

    "text": "In set theory and its applications throughout mathematics, a class is a collection of mathematical objects (often sets) that can be unambiguously defined by a property that all its members share. Classes act as a way to have set-like collections while differing from sets so as to avoid paradoxes, especially Russell's paradox (see   Paradoxes). The precise definition of  class  depends on foundational context. In work on Zermelo Fraenkel set theory, the notion of class is informal, whereas other set theories, such as von Neumann Bernays Gödel set theory, axiomatize the notion of  proper class , e.g., as entities that are not members of another entity. A class that is not a set (informally in Zermelo Fraenkel) is called a proper class, and a class that is a set is sometimes called a small class. For instance, the class of all ordinal numbers, and the class of all sets, are proper classes in many formal systems. In Quine's set-theoretical writing, the phrase  ultimate class  is often used instead of the phrase  proper class  emphasising that in the systems he considers, certain classes cannot be members, and are thus the final term in any membership chain to which they belong. Outside set theory, the word  class  is sometimes used synonymously with  set .",

    "text": "Outside set theory, the word  class  is sometimes used synonymously with  set . This usage dates from a historical period when classes and sets were not distinguished as they are in modern set-theoretic terminology. Many discussions of  classes  in the 19th century and earlier are really referring to sets, or rather perhaps take place without considering that certain classes can fail to be sets. Examples\nThe collection of all algebraic structures of a given type will usually be a proper class. Examples include the class of all groups, the class of all vector spaces, and many others. In category theory, a category whose collection of objects forms a proper class (or whose collection of morphisms forms a proper class) is called a large category. The surreal numbers are a proper class of objects that have the properties of a field. Within set theory, many collections of sets turn out to be proper classes. Examples include the class of all sets (the universal class), the class of all ordinal numbers, and the class of all cardinal numbers. One way to prove that a class is proper is to place it in bijection with the class of all ordinal numbers. This method is used, for example, in the proof that there is no free complete lattice on three or more generators. Paradoxes\nThe paradoxes of naive set theory can be explained in terms of the inconsistent tacit assumption that  all classes are sets .",

    "text": "Paradoxes\nThe paradoxes of naive set theory can be explained in terms of the inconsistent tacit assumption that  all classes are sets . With a rigorous foundation, these paradoxes instead suggest proofs that certain classes are proper (i.e., that they are not sets). For example, Russell's paradox suggests a proof that the class of all sets which do not contain themselves is proper, and the Burali-Forti paradox suggests that the class of all ordinal numbers is proper. The paradoxes do not arise with classes because there is no notion of classes containing classes. Otherwise, one could, for example, define a class of all classes that do not contain themselves, which would lead to a Russell paradox for classes. A conglomerate, on the other hand, can have proper classes as members. Classes in formal set theories\nZF set theory does not formalize the notion of classes, so each formula with classes must be reduced syntactically to a formula without classes. For example, one can reduce the formula \n \n \n \n A\n  \n  \n x\n  \n x\n  \n x\n  \n \n \n   displaystyle A   x mid x x   \n \n to \n \n \n \n  \n x\n (\n x\n  \n A\n  \n x\n  \n x\n )\n \n \n   displaystyle  forall x(x in A leftrightarrow x x) \n \n.",

Another approach is taken by the von Neumann Bernays Gödel axioms (NBG); classes are the basic objects in this theory, and a set is then defined to be a class that is an element of some other class. However, the class existence axioms of NBG are restricted so that they only quantify over sets, rather than over all classes. This causes NBG to be a conservative extension of ZFC. Morse Kelley set theory admits proper classes as basic objects, like NBG, but also allows quantification over all proper classes in its class existence axioms. This causes Morse Kelley set theory to be strictly stronger than both NBG and ZFC.",

The present municipality was created in 1974 when the former market town (köping) Sjöbo was amalgamated with the surrounding rural municipalities. There are fifteen original entities within today's municipality. Geography\nThe town of Sjöbo has flat terrain, with many small houses and three long straight streets stretching through it, leading to larger roads. The northwestern part of the municipality includes the main part of Vombsjön, the largest lake of southern Scania and notable for being the water source of Malmö. Some parts of the lake belong to Lund Municipality. It offers fishing for European perch, pike, pikeperch and eel. Localities\nThere are 9 urban areas (also called a Tätort or locality) in Sjöbo Municipality. In the table they are listed according to the size of the population as of December 31, 2005. The municipal seat is in bold characters. Activities\nThere are at least five (largely) authentic medieval churches from the 12th century in the municipality (in Södra Åsum, Tolånga, Björka, Blentarp and Everlöv).",

Frescos which adorned the apse of Södra Åsum church and the ceilings of the churches in Everlöv and Illstrop centuries ago have been slowly uncovered in recent years. Many similar churches had their ornamentation stripped and their paintings plastered over as part of the iconoclasm of Sweden's adoption of Lutheranism. Apart from religious activities, there is the annual festival Sjöbo marknad, which translates to English as Sjöbo fair. It was first held in 1864, and is now held in late July, attracting some 100,000 visitors, making it one of the largest country fairs in Sweden.

    "text": "Ronald Reagan Speaks Out Against Socialized Medicine is a 1961 LP featuring the actor and future U.S. president Ronald Reagan. In this ten-minute recording, Reagan  criticized Social Security for supplanting private savings and warned that subsidized medicine would curtail Americans' freedom  and that  pretty soon your son won't decide when he's in school, where he will go or what he will do for a living. He will wait for the government to tell him. Roger Lowenstein called the LP part of a  stealth program  conducted by the American Medical Association (see Operation Coffee Cup). Summary\nReagan opens by saying that in 1927 socialist Norman Thomas said that the American people would never vote for socialism, but  under the name of liberalism the American people would adopt every fragment of the socialist program. Snopes.com calls this attribution probably false, arguing that  no one has ever been able to turn up a source . Reagan says that  Government has invaded the free precincts of private citizens,  stating that the U.S. government owns  1 5 of the total industrial capacity of the United States. Reagan says  One of the traditional methods of imposing statism or socialism on a people has been by way of medicine. It's very easy to disguise a medical program as a humanitarian project; most people are a little reluctant to oppose anything that suggests medical care for people who possibly can't afford it.",

Reagan cites the failure of President Harry S. Truman's national health insurance proposal as evidence of the American people's rejection of socialized medicine. Reagan describes Representative Aime Forand as having introduced a bill which would institute  compulsory health insurance  for all people of social security age. Forand is quoted as having said,  If we can only break through and get our foot inside the door, then we can extend the program after that. Forand is likened to labor union leader Walter Reuther, who is quoted as having said,  It's no secret that the United Automobile Workers is officially on record of backing a program of national health insurance. The Forand bill is described as being praised by socialists:  They say once the Forand bill is passed this nation will be provided with a mechanism for socialized medicine capable of indefinite expansion in every direction until it includes the entire population. Now we can't say we haven't been warned. Reagan describes Representative Cecil R. King of California as the successor to Congressman Forand in his support for a bill that would provide senior citizens with medical care; this bill was being championed by President John F. Kennedy at the time.",

Reagan cites the expansion of private health insurance and the passage of the 1960 Kerr-Mills Act, which provided federal funds to states to cover the  medically needy,  as evidence that King's legislation is unnecessary. Reagan concludes that the new bill is  simply an excuse to bring about what they wanted all the time: socialized medicine. Reagan warns against the danger of encroaching on the relationship between patients and doctors, and of an attack on doctors' freedoms. Reagan encourages his listeners to join a letter-writing campaign to Congress with the message,  We do not want socialized medicine. Reagan quotes Representative Charles A. Halleck of Indiana as having said,  When the American people wants something from Congress, regardless of its political complexion, if they make their wants known, Congress does what the people want.",

Reagan warns that if his listeners do not stop the proposed medical program,  behind it will come other government programs that will invade every area of freedom as we have known it in this country until one day as Norman Thomas said we will wake to find that we have socialism. Under this scenario, Reagan says,  We are going to spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children, what it once was like in America when men were free. Criticism\nIn 1966, Governor Pat Brown, campaigning for re-election against Reagan, said of Reagan's speech about socialized medicine, that Reagan was  an enemy of social progress,  who had  hired  out to the American Medical Association. In response, Reagan accused him of  pure demagoguery  in suggesting that California's elderly had reason to fear a Reagan victory in the race for governor. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter, campaigning for re-election against Reagan, told crowds that:  As a traveling salesman for the American Medical Association campaign against Medicare,  Reagan  sowed the fear that Medicare would mean socialism and that it would lead to the destruction of our freedom.",

Impressing as both U18 and reserve team coach, Thalhammer was put in charge of the first team in 2004, making the then 33-year-old the youngest coach in the history of the Austrian Bundesliga. Leaving the role after eleven months with Admira losing their first six games of the 2005-06 season, and having moved through a series of Austrian men's clubs through the 2000s, Thalhammer made a switch to women's football in 2011. Austria women's team coach\nThalhammer was appointed coach of both the Austria women's national team and the Austrian U17 women in 2011.

The Austrian won seven of his first eight games in charge at Cercle, finishing the 2021-22 Pro League season 10th of the 18 clubs, missing out on the European play-offs by two places. A poor start to the following campaign saw him replaced in September 2022 by his assistant Miron Muslic. Thalhammer quickly moved to nearby KV Oostende, but with the club suffering from a severe lack of funding, they were relegated at the end of the 2022 23 Belgian Pro League season, and Thalhammer stood down as coach.

The company designed and manufactured in-ear computing technology, including earplugs and wireless smart earbuds. History\nDoppler Labs was co-founded by Noah Kraft, Fritz Lanman, and Dan Wiggins. Kraft had previously worked in the entertainment industry, and was employed as a strategic consultant for Google working for John Hanke on a mobile game called Ingress. Kraft also worked for Lyor Cohen during the founding of 300 Entertainment. Lanman was an executive at Microsoft and a prominent angel investor. Dan Wiggins is a long-time veteran in the acoustics and technology world who has worked for Rode, Event Electronics, Siemens, Microsoft, SONOS, Apple, Dolby and many more. Before voice assistants or true wireless technology were prevalent, Doppler Labs envisioned that computing would move onto the body and into the ear and that voice would become a more primary interface for how humans interact with technology. With Apple's removal of the headphone jack, the launch of the AirPods, and the prevalence of Alexa, the smart earbud category that Doppler helped create was expected to become a  40 billion industry by 2020. In July 2015, Doppler raised  17 million in series B funding bringing the company's total funding to over  50 million.",

Doppler Labs first product was DUBS Acoustic Filters, high-tech ear plugs designed that used a proprietary 17-piece physical acoustic filter system to reduce the sound pressure at different frequencies while maintaining acoustical fidelity. In July 2016, Doppler Labs Labs launched Here Active Listening at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and in 2017 launched its flagship product Here One, a pair of wireless smart earbuds that allowed users to selectively filter ambient sound, stream music, and amplify speech. It could also be used to take phone calls and selectively filter certain sounds, such as background noise. Here One was called the world's first in-ear computer. In March 2017, Doppler Labs sued Bose for trademark infringement of their Here Buds trademark. The company supported the Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act of 2017 (OTC Hearing Aid Act).

It is a three-dimensional action-adventure game that was developed by Talon Inc. and published by Sammy. The story focuses on a counter-terrorist unit known as INTER-ANTS (International Anti-terrorist Service). Gameplay\nThe game is set in 2001, when a terrorist organization known as Hephaestus has risen, with the aforementioned INTER-ANTS being formed as a response to combat them. Deep Freeze is an action adventure game. All the characters act in teams. At the beginning of each mission, players can pick one of five characters who will play as a partner and provide cover fire. This computer-controlled partner can be controlled through simple commands. The game features many weapons the player can choose from the start, including a shotgun, Uzi submachine gun, and magnum handgun. Players can also collect grenades in the game, which can flush out enemies hidden behind obstacles such as barrels. The player can also perform rolls, which allows them to dodge bullets from enemies. Despite being released in Japan only, the game features English voice acting. However, all the menus in the game are in Japanese. The game uses pre-rendered backgrounds and camera switching in a similar fashion to the game Resident Evil. Release\nThe game was shown at the 2000 Tokyo Games Show gaming convention in Japan.",

The game has never been released outside of Japan, nor has it ever been released on the PlayStation Network game archives either. Reception\nThe game received mostly positive reviews upon release. Famitsu gave the game a score of 26 out of 40. Ralph Karels writing in the German video game magazine Video Games gave it a 75 out of 100. He recommended the game for fans of Resident Evil series, and those who like import games. However, he cautioned that knowledge of Japanese is needed to complete the game because the menus are in Japanese. Super Gamepower gave it a score of 4 out of 5 in all categories (sound, graphics, fun, control) and an overall score of 4 out of 5.

The writer explained that such a format worked for Resident Evil since it was slower paced, it doesn't work in Deep Freeze. Also, the writer commented on the voice acting, calling it  horrendous  and said the enemy AI was too passive for simply standing there while the player reloaded. See also\nHard Edge\n   References",

From the east, the highway stretches from the Grantley Adams International Airport in Christ Church, to the western end at Cave Hill Road and University Drive, Cave Hill Campus, University of the West Indies, in Saint Michael. It roughly encircles the Parish of Saint Michael and the wider metropolitan area of Bridgetown. Route description\nThe highway consists of two-lane and dual carriageway sections with at-grade intersections, mostly roundabouts. A 2006 2007 expansion project enlarged some areas, and there was some public sentiment voiced in local media about the project's lack of a competitive tender process or studies to justify costs. On July 24, 2006, Rayside Construction and C.O. Williams Construction, two local companies, began the construction and widening of the ABC Highway from the Darcy Scott Roundabout in Warrens, St. Michael to the Garfield Sobers Roundabout in Bartletts, Christ Church. As part of the project, the old streetlights and traffic lights at the junctions of the ABC Highway and Pine East-West Boulevard, Upton Road at BET Hill on Highway R and Highway 6 were removed, and jersey barriers were constructed in the center.",

Examples are Icelandic and Faroese, which have the terms feðgar  father and son , feðgin  father and daughter , mæðgin  mother and son , mæðgur  mother and daughter . Chinese and Japanese use compound nouns to make dyadic terms, such as (in Japanese) 親子 oyako  parent and child , 兄弟 kyōdai  brothers; siblings , 姉妹 shimai  sisters , and 夫婦 fūfu  husband and wife . The languages which have such terms are concentrated in the western Pacific. There are at least ten in New Guinea, including Oksapmin, Menya, and the Ok languages; fifteen or more Austronesian languages, from Taiwan to New Caledonia; and at least sixty in Australia, such as Kayardild above. There are sporadic examples in Northern Eurasia, including a few Turkic and Uralic languages, Yukaghir, and Ainu; depending on definitions, the Yi languages of Southeast Asia may also be said to have such terms. Elsewhere they are rare, or at least have not been described.",

Through this illegal arrest, he was unrightfully sentenced for many years under terrorism instead for gambling. This was done by the same cop and gambler that Shams lost against (played by Saife Hassan). Shams was  Laapata  and nobody knew where he went.

Rumour has it that Daniyal actually murdered his ex-wife because he suspected that she was cheating on him and couldn't control his anger. In Karachi, after a visit to Shams' prison cell by survey cops, they discover that he was wrongfully sentenced by the same cop two years ago. This is discovered due to an ongoing investigation after the murder of the same cop that sentenced Shams for terrorism. Shams is immediately bailed and sent home. After two years, Shams returns home and is shocked and saddened to learn of Falak's marriage. After a confronting phone call from an upset Falak, Shams decides to move on and finds a job in a local factory as a millworker supervisor. Geeti asks her mother to get her engaged to Shams as now Falak has cleared her path. Her mother initially hesitates because of Shams' past but agrees and talks to Shams's parents.

Hervieu's plays are built upon a severely logical method, the mechanism of which is sometimes so evident as to destroy the necessary sense of illusion. The closing words of La Course du flambeau (1901)  Pour ma fille, j'ai tué ma mère  (For my daughter, I killed my mother), are an example of his selection of a plot representing an extreme theory. The riddle in L'Énigme (1901) (staged at Wyndham's Theatre, London, 1 March 1902, as Caesar's Wife) is, however, worked out with great art, and Le Dédale (1903), dealing with the obstacles to the remarriage of a divorced woman, is reckoned among the masterpieces of the modern French stage.

In 2010, Vasandani received the Downbeat Magazine Critic's Poll for  Rising Star Jazz Vocalist \nIn a September 20, 2009, review in The New York Times, Nate Chinen called Vasandani  a jazz singer with good ideas, including some about what a jazz singer can be. In a review of Eyes Wide Open, The Boston Globe suggested that Vasandani is  mature in sound and rich in texture but also possesses enough youthful angst in its lyrical themes to ward off the fogeyism that male vocalists so easily slip into before their time. In an NPR interview that aired in 2011, anchor Michele Norris said,  Every now and again you hear a special voice that makes you sit up and take notice. Sachal Vasandani has that voice . Slow Motion Miracles (2015) features original compositions, incorporating  an almost undefinable fusion of the best of pop, electronic, and jazz. The album was produced by Michael Leonhart.

The Royal Proclamation of 1763 enlarged the colony of Canada under the name of the Province of Quebec, which with the Constitutional Act 1791 became known as the Canadas. With the Act of Union 1840, Upper and Lower Canada were joined to become the Province of Canada. By the 1860s, interest developed in forming a new federation between the Canadas and the other British colonies of British North America, that led to Confederation in 1867. A number of other British colonies that are today part of Canada, such as Newfoundland and British Columbia, and large territories such as Rupert's Land, initially remained outside the newly formed federation. New France under British rule\nIn North America, the Seven Years' War had seen Great Britain conquer the entirety of the French colony of Canada. The war officially ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on February 10, 1763.

Although many British people (including the American colonies to the south) hoped the French Canadians would be assimilated this was not the case as distinct rules of governance for Quebec were set out in the Quebec Act such as allowing the French Canadians to retain their Catholic religion and their French system of civil law. The Quebec Act became one of the Intolerable Acts that infuriated the thirteen British colonies in what would become the United States of America. Atlantic coast\nThe island colony of Newfoundland had been dominated by the British for a long time before the French finally abandoned any claims to the area. An anglophone society had already taken shape prior to 1763, although two islands were reserved for French fishermen. In the Maritimes, the British had previously expelled many of the French colonists of Acadia in 1755 to Louisiana, but this would not be repeated in 1763.

The British Conquest of Acadia (which included Nova Scotia peninsula, but not present-day New Brunswick) happened in 1710, and the British had already established settlements, including Halifax. The establishment of Halifax sparked Father Le Loutre's War, which, in turn, led to the British expelling the Acadians from the region during the French and Indian War. As they later captured Cape Breton Island and Prince Edward Island, the policy of expulsion was extended there as well. The few Acadians who managed to return to the area have created the contemporary Acadian society. Once the Acadians were expelled, other settlements were formed by New England Planters. American Revolution\nIn 1775, American revolutionaries (Patriots) attempted to push their insurrection into northeastern Quebec. Support for the Patriot cause was mixed; the clergy and landowners were generally opposed to it, while English-speaking merchants and migrants from the Thirteen Colonies were generally supportive of it. The habitants were divided; in some areas (notably the region between Montreal and Saint-Jean), there was significant support, and militia companies were raised in support of the Patriots by James Livingston. The Patriots laid siege to Fort Saint-Jean, capturing it and Montreal in November 1775.",

In Nova Scotia there was some agitation against British rule, largely instigated by Jonathan Eddy and John Allan, migrants from Massachusetts who had settled in the Chignecto Isthmus area near Fort Cumberland (formerly Fort Beauséjour). The only major event of their resistance was the Battle of Fort Cumberland, when Eddy and a combined force of Massachusetts Patriots, Acadians, and aboriginals besieged the fort in November 1776. The siege was broken and Eddy's forces were scattered when British reinforcements arrived. Eddy and Allan continued to make trouble on the frontier between what is now Maine and New Brunswick from a base in Machias for several years. The Maritime provinces were also affected by privateering, and raids on settlements by privateers in violation of their letters of marque.

From there, part of his men took Vincennes, but was soon lost to British Lieutenant Colonel Henry Hamilton, the commander at Fort Detroit. It was later retaken by Clark in the Siege of Fort Vincennes in February 1779. Roughly half of Clark's militia in the theatre were Canadien volunteers sympathetic to the American cause. In the end, the British Empire was defeated in the Revolutionary War and formally ceded parts of southwestern Canada to the new United States as part of the Treaty of Paris.

This opened the way to British expansion in that area, and a number of expeditions took place; firstly a naval expedition led by George Vancouver which explored the inlets around the Pacific North West, particularly around Vancouver Island. On land, expeditions took place hoping for a discovery of a practicable river route to the Pacific for the extension of the North American fur trade, namely the North West Company. Sir Alexander Mackenzie led the first starting out in 1792 overland from Lake Athabasca via the Peace and Fraser Rivers, reaching the Pacific ocean near present-day Bella Coola on 20 July 1793. Mackenzie became the first European to reach the Pacific overland north of the Rio Grande which preceded the Lewis and Clark Expedition by twelve years. Shortly thereafter, Mackenzie's companion, John Finlay, founded the first permanent European settlement in British Columbia, Fort St. John.

Much of the settler population of Upper Canada (now southern Ontario) were Americans who had very recently arrived in the colony, and some of them did support the invading force; however, the rest of the settler population was made up of the descendants of Loyalists or the original French colonists, who did not want to be part of the United States. The first American invasion came in October 1812, but they were defeated by General Isaac Brock at the Battle of Queenston Heights. The Americans invaded again in 1813, capturing Fort York (now Toronto). Later in the year, the Americans took control of the Great Lakes after the Battle of Lake Erie and the Battle of the Thames, but they had much less success in Lower Canada, where they were defeated at the Battle of Châteauguay and the Battle of Crysler's Farm.

Fur trade\nFor centuries one of the most important economic ventures in North America was the fur trade. This trade, which had been pioneered by the French, came to be dominated by the British as they gained increasing territory on the continent. The main British fur trading posts were located inside of what became the United States (the British were forced to relocate northward as borders were established with the new nation). First Nations were central to the trade as they were the primary fur trappers. The role gave the peoples of many of the First Nations a political voice as, though they were viewed as an underclass, they were too important to simply be ignored. The American Revolution led to intense competition between the British and the U.S. By the 1830s changing fashions in Europe had begun a steep decline in fur prices and an overall collapse in the market. Apart from the economic losses to whites involved in the fur trade, many of the First Nations were devastated, both in terms of economic loss and in terms of loss of influence in local politics.",

Timber trade\nAs the fur trade declined in importance, the timber trade became Canada's most important commodity. The industry became concentrated in three main regions. The first to be exploited was the Saint John River system. Trees in the still almost deserted hinterland of New Brunswick were cut and transported to Saint John where they were shipped to England. This area soon could not keep up with demand, and the trade moved to the St. Lawrence River where logs were shipped to Quebec City before being sent on to Europe. This area also became insufficient, and the trade expanded westward, most notably to the Ottawa River system, which by 1845 provided three quarters of the timber shipped from Quebec City. The timber trade became a massive business. In one summer 1200 ships were loaded with timber at Quebec City alone. Responsible government  and the Rebellions of 1837 38\nAfter the War of 1812, the first half of the 19th century saw the growth of political reform movements in both Upper and Lower Canada, largely influenced by American and French republicanism.

The moderate reformers, such as Robert Baldwin and Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine, argued for a more representational form of government which they called  responsible government . By  responsible,  the reformers meant that such a government would be ultimately responsible to the will of the subjects of the colonies, not to authorities in London. The critical move toward responsible government came between 1846 and 1850. In practice, it meant that the Executive Council of each colony formulated policy with the assistance of the legislative branch. The legislature voted approval or disapproval, and the appointed governor enacted those policies that it had approved. It was a transition from the older system when the governor took advice from an executive council, and use the legislature chiefly to raise money. The radical reformers, such as William Lyon Mackenzie and Louis-Joseph Papineau demanded equality or a complete break from British rule and the establishment of a republic. Louis-Joseph Papineau was elected speaker of the colonial assembly in 1815. His attempts at reform were ignored by the British, and in 1834, the assembly passed The Ninety-Two Resolutions, outlining its grievances against the legislative council.

For Durham, the French Canadians were culturally backwards, and he was convinced that only a union of French and English Canada would allow the colony to progress in the interest of Great Britain.

Confederation\nEffective governance of the Province of Canada after 1840 required a careful balancing of the interests of French and English- speaking populations; and between Catholics and Protestants. John A. Macdonald emerged in the 1850s as a personality who could manage that task. A political conservative, MacDonald forged political relationships and coalitions with George-Étienne Cartier, the leader of powerful French Canadian bleus, and George Brown of the more stridently reformist English-Canadian and anti-French  Grits . MacDonald came to realize that Canada's likeliest hope of resisting absorption into the United States was to reform itself into a workable federation. A delegation from the Canadas made its way to a conference being held in Charlottetown in 1864 by representatives from the Maritimes who had intended to hold discussions regarding a federation of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.

Privacy law in New Zealand is dealt with by statute and the common law. The Privacy Act 2020 addresses the collection, storage and handling of information. A general right to privacy has otherwise been created in the tort of privacy. Such a right was recognised in Hosking v Runting  2003  3 NZLR 385, a case that dealt with publication of private facts. In the subsequent case C v Holland  2012  NZHC 2155 the Court recognised a right to privacy in the sense of seclusion or a right to be free from unwanted intrusion. Legislation\nNew Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990\nThe New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 (NZBORA) is based on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, however no express right to privacy is included in the Act.

It is suggested that privacy was not included in NZBORA due to its difficulty to define, and because the social environment at the time was not one in which it was appropriate to implement a right with vague and uncertain parameters. Privacy Act 2020\nNew Zealand has a statute entitled the Privacy Act 2020 (which replaced the Privacy Act 1993). However, despite its declaration that it is an Act to promote and protect individual privacy, it in fact only covers information privacy. The Privacy Act was created to combat concerns about technological advances and their potential to be used to access private information, when this risk had been far less under manual data systems. The Act contains 13 Information Privacy Principles which govern the handling of private information by agencies. An 'agency' is widely defined as any person or body of persons, whether public or private, and whether corporate or unincorporated, with specified exceptions. There are also numerous exceptions to the Information Privacy Principles, which can be found both within the principles and in other places within the Act. When an individual feels there has been a breach of the principles he or she can lodge a complaint with the Privacy Commissioner. The Privacy Commissioner investigates the complaint and undertakes a process of conciliation rather than punishment.",

The Privacy Commissioner investigates the complaint and undertakes a process of conciliation rather than punishment. If the complaint cannot be settled, it may be referred to the Human Rights Review Tribunal, which may or may not consider the situation anew, and it's quite likely that they won't consider a complaint at all (especially if the issue is related to debt). If the Tribunal finds there has been a breach, it may award a range of remedies including damages and restraining orders. The Privacy Act recognises that privacy is not an absolute concept and that there are other factors which need to be weighed to determine what the outcome should be. The Privacy Commissioner must always have regard to factors such as human rights, social interests, and international obligations and guidelines. The Privacy Commissioner is able to make authorisations regarding the use of private information which would normally be contrary to the Act if he or she is satisfied that the public interest or benefit outweighs the interference with privacy.

The New Zealand Court of Appeal in a bare majority in Hosking v Runting accepted that there was a tort of privacy in New Zealand. The tort was affirmed as protection in this area was needed and the breach of confidence tort was not suitable to cover situations involving privacy. The two requirements for the tort set out by the majority closely reflect those set out in P v D:\nExistence of facts which were reasonably expected to be private\nPublicity given to those facts which would be considered highly offensive by the objective and reasonable person. In addition, privacy had to be weighed against the defence of legitimate public concern which encompasses the right to freedom of expression.

Prior to the introduction of the Intelligence and Security Act 2017, these bodies operated strictly independently of one another, and general mystery surrounded their exact functions and capabilities. Much of the confusion originated from the fact that the SIS and GCSB appeared to have differing objectives which meant that, if required, co-operation and coordination would likely be complex and convoluted. For example, only the SIS could perform surveillance, or spy, on New Zealanders, as provided by the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service Act 1969. There were stipulations as to what 'spy-activities' were permitted, and as a pre-requisite, any proposed surveillance had to be relevant to  security  and its associated threats, such as instances of 'espionage, sabotage, subversion or terrorist attacks'.",

Following a formal request from the United States' Federal Bureau of Investigation that Kim Dotcom be extradited to the United States, the GCSB spied on Mr Dotcom in order to assist the FBI's request. However, as the GCSB did not have the legal authority to conduct surveillance, Justice Gilbert of the Court of Appeal, deemed unlawful. Following this widely publicised incident, GCSB Director Ian Fletcher and Chief Executive of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet Andrew Kibblewhite initiated a review of compliance. They assigned the then Cabinet Secretary Rebecca Kitteridge with undertaking the review to look into the  activities, systems and processes since 1 April 2003 . This date is significant as it was the date from which the Government Communications Security Bureau Act 2003 came into force. The  Kitteridge Report  ultimately concluded that GCSB lacked the legal basis and authority to perform many of its intelligence acts   including the surveillance carried out on Kim Dotcom. The Kitteridge Report made a number of recommendations to ensure that the Government agency had the legal authority to do the activities necessary.",

New Zealand's first Intelligence and Security Review was undertaken by Sir Michael Cullen and Dame Patsy Reddy, and looked at  the legislative framework governing the agencies and considered whether they were well placed to protect New Zealand s current and future national security while protecting individual rights . The review was completed at the end of February 2016, and its findings proposed that one Act be introduced to bring all of New Zealand's intelligence and security agencies together. Cullen and Reddy identified a number of issues in their report. One of the prominent issues identified was that the fragmented legislative landscape meant that it was difficult to bring the multiple agencies together when required. Because each intelligence and security agency operated under its own legislative framework, it was confusing for New Zealanders to understand which agency was responsible for what, and exactly what their lawful powers and capabilities were. The reviewers concluded that a  single Act  was necessary to overcome these issues. They commented that a single Act would:\n give a comprehensive and much clearer view of the agencies' functions and powers, and the checks and balances that apply to the operation of their powers    and  would avoid inconsistencies and gaps between various statutes and enable a consistent set of fundamental principles to be applied to the agencies and their oversight .",

Another issue concerning to the reviewers was the lack of security protection available to New Zealanders under the prevailing legislation. The most recent piece of legislation dealing with intelligence and surveillance was enacted some 47 years ago, the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service Act 1969. Over the course of those years and the accompanying advances in technology, the need to overhaul the law has increased markedly. As terrorist groups continue to advance in their technological capabilities, the current legislation was quickly becoming out-dated and unsuitable for present day society. The Intelligence and Security Act 2017\nThe purpose of the Intelligence and Security Act 2017 was to bring clarity and cohesion to the GCSB and SIS, the two agencies in New Zealand responsible for monitoring the country's security and intelligence. The Act was  a direct response to the report of the First Independent Review of Intelligence and Security in New Zealand: Intelligence and Security in a Free Society, and it replaces the four Acts that applied to the GCSB, the NZSIS, and their oversight bodies .

Although the Act intended to give oversight and transparency to the New Zealand intelligence and security agencies, the Act was drafted in a manner that gave far-reaching powers to the GCSB and SIS to perform surveillance on New Zealand citizens and non-residents in ways that had previously been prohibited. The basis for doing so was that New Zealand's national security is at stake with the ever-present and increased risk of terrorism in today's society.

It has a round body and three or four metal strings. Name\nAccording to A. S. Famintsyn, domra is the russified form of Arabic tanbura. History\nThe first known written mention of the domra is in Admonitions of Metropolitan Daniel (1530). This musical instrument gained great popularity in the 16th 17th centuries, replacing the gusli. There are numerous mentions of the domra in historic documents of this period. For instance, Alphabet (1654), in the Moscow Synodal Library, says:  As to what musikiia is: Musikiia, playing, that is, the sounding of gusli and kiniry, or lyres, and domry, and similar things .

    "text": "In addition, medieval Russian illuminated manuscripts of the Psalter contain images of musicians with necked plucked-string instruments, and some of those miniatures are clearly captioned  depiction of domras . Judging by those images, late medieval Russian domry can be divided into two types: lute-shaped, which had five to six strings, a large body and а pegbox angled back, and tanbur-shaped, which had three to four strings, a small body and a straight pegbox. After the pious Tsar Alexis of Russia issued an edict ordering the persecution of Russian folk musicians and destruction of their instruments (1648), the domra gradually came into disuse and was replaced by the balalaika, which was much easier to make and play. According to the edict:\nWhenever domras appear, they should be confiscated and, after those objects of demonic games are broken, burned. And people who play them should be beaten and sent to the end of our state. In 1896, a student of Vasily Vasilievich Andreyev found a broken instrument in a stable in rural Russia. It was thought that this instrument may have been an example of a domra, although at that time no illustrations or examples of the traditional domra were known to exist (the traditional domra was only known through numerous mentions in folklore, though examples existed of the dombra, a related Turkic instrument).",

    "text": "In the textile arts, plying (from the French verb plier,  to fold , from the Latin verb plico, from the ancient Greek verb πλέκω.) is a process of twisting one or more strings (called strands or plies) of yarn together to create a stronger yarn. Strands are twisted together in the direction opposite that in which they were spun. Plied yarns will not unravel, break, or degrade as easily as unplied yarns. When enough twist is added to the plies to counter the initial twist of each strand, the resulting yarn is  balanced , having no tendency to twist upon itself. The number of strands used to make the yarn is usually the same as the number of plies it has. Two-ply yarn means two strands were used, three-ply yarn means three strands were used, etc. Embroidery floss is generally a six-ply yarn, for example. There are some exceptions to this, most notably in chain plying. Plying handspun yarns\nThere are two common ways to ply a balanced yarn: regular and chain plying. Both methods involve the manipulation of  singles  unplied strands on their own into multiple-ply yarns by applying twist in the opposite direction than how the single was spun.",

    "text": "Both methods involve the manipulation of  singles  unplied strands on their own into multiple-ply yarns by applying twist in the opposite direction than how the single was spun. For example, if in spinning the single the wheel was spinning clockwise (called a  Z  twist, as on any given side the fibres appear to cross each other like the line in the middle of the letter  Z ), the wheel must spin counter-clockwise (an  S  twist) in order to ply it. Regular plying\nRegular plying consists of taking 2 or more singles and twisting them together. This can be done on either a spinning wheel or a spindle. When plying, the singles are kept separate, either with the fingers or with a tool. This tool can be anything from the top of a salt dispenser, and the singles threaded through the holes, or a specially carved piece of wood with holes in it. The singles are kept separate to ensure that they do not get tangled and so the tension can be controlled. Most spinners who use spinning wheels ply from bobbins or spools. This is easier than plying from balls because there is less chance for the yarn to become tangled and knotted. So that the bobbins can unwind freely, they are put in a device called a Lazy Kate, or sometimes simply kate. The simplest lazy kate consists of wooden bars with a metal rod running between them. Most hold three or four bobbins.",

    "text": "The simplest lazy kate consists of wooden bars with a metal rod running between them. Most hold three or four bobbins. The bobbin sits on the metal rod. Other lazy kates are built with devices that create an adjustable amount of tension, which adds control to how much string is unwound using a given amount of force. Some spinning wheels come with a built-in lazy kate. On a drop spindle, two-ply is created by placing the spools on a lazy kate, tying the ends together onto the drop spindle, holding equal lengths of singles together and dropping the spindle. The weight of the drop spindle, combined with the twist in the singles, causes the drop spindle to turn in the opposite direction that the singles were twisted in until the two singles are plied together. Chain plying\nChain plying (also known as Navajo plying) consists of making large loops, similar to crocheting. Only one single is necessary, and if the single is already dyed, this technique allows it to be plied without changing the color scheme. The spinner first makes a loop on the end of the leader the string left on the bobbin, which the new yarn is spun from that is large enough to slip their hand through. They pull some of the working yarn through the loop. Then the spinner starts applying twist to the three plies, consisting of the two sides of the loop together with the yarn pulled through it.",

    "text": "They pull some of the working yarn through the loop. Then the spinner starts applying twist to the three plies, consisting of the two sides of the loop together with the yarn pulled through it. When the loop and the yarn are nearly fully plied together, a new loop of yarn is pulled through the initial loop, and spinning continues. This process is repeated until the yarn is all plied. This technique allows the spinner to try to match up thick and thin spots in the yarn, thus making for a smoother end product. Center-pull ball plying\nCenter-pull ball plying results in yarn similar in appearance to regular plying. However, it doesn t require a lazy kate or multiple bobbins. It requires a single bobbin and a center-pull ball winder or a nostepinne to create the center-pull ball that is plied with. Once the ball is wound, the single from both the center and outside are held together, in a similar manner to the regular plying method, then twisted together. This results in a two-ply yarn. Center-pull ball plying results in one single being more tightly wound than the other, causing a fluffier and looser texture when knit, compared to the regular plying method. Machined yarns\nMachines that ply yarn use the 'regular' method mentioned above.",

The main difference is that gears control the intake, making sure that the strands all have the same tension and the same length. Other than that, the process for plying is exactly the same as when hand done. Novelty yarns\nMany novelty yarns make use of special plying techniques to gain their special effects. By varying the tension in the strands, or the relative sizes of the strands, or many other factors different effects can be achieved. For example, when a soft, thick strand is plied against a tightly twisted thin strand, the resulting yarn spirals. Another example is bouclé, which is a yarn where one strand is held loosely and allowed to make loops on the other yarn while plying.

Description\nCercis occidentalis is a deciduous shrub to small tree, growing up to 7 metres (23 ft) tall. The largest individual is in Santa Rosa and is 8.8 metres (29 ft) high. Its crown is rounded on clustered, erect branches to a width of 10 20 feet (3.0 6.1 m). The branches are thin, shiny, and brown. Twigs are slender, erect, and hairless. The leaves are arranged alternately along the twigs and are simple, round, and slightly leathery, growing to 5 9 centimetres (2.0 3.5 in) in diameter, with 12 25-millimetre (0.47 0.98 in) petioles.

The upper surfaces of the leaves are dark green, shiny, and hairless, while their lower surfaces are green and hairless. They start as light green early in the season and darken as they age; on plants at higher elevation, leaves may turn gold or red as the weather cools. Inflorescences are unbranched and showy with bright pink or magenta flowers. Flowers, described as similar to pea flowers, measure about 12 millimetres (0.47 in) long and appear before leaves emerge. They grow in clusters all over the shrub, making the plant very colorful and noticeable in the landscape. The fruits are legume pods, 4 7.5 centimetres (1.6 3.0 in) long and about 12 millimetres (0.47 in) wide, thin and dry, and brown or reddish-purple. The clustered pods persist through winter. It is an abundant seeder and seeds have a high rate of germination. It endures shade in early life and light shade when mature; shade tolerance appears to be greater with increased soil moisture.

Compared to the more commonly cultivated Cercis canadensis, it has more rounded leaves and tends to grow as a small shrub rather than a tree, although it does commonly grow as larger trees up to 25 feet tall, particularly in natural settings. Habitat\nIts native habitats include foothill woodlands and chaparrals; they grow near stream banks in dry foothills and lower canyon slopes below 1,100 metres (3,600 ft). It grows frequently in crevices and pockets where seeds are well covered with mineral soil. Ecology\nCercis occidentalis flowers bloom in spring from February to April. As is the case with other legumes, it is a nitrogen-fixing plant because of the presence of root nodules, allowing symbiotic bacteria to produce nitrogen. They grow singly and in shrubby clumps alongside California buckeye, ceanothus, manzanita, and other chaparral brush. It is noted for attracting birds and other wildlife. The leaves are harvested by native leafcutter bees and the flowers are an important nectar and pollen source for native insects and hummingbirds.

Uses\nIndigenous Californians use the twigs of the western redbud to weave baskets, and even prune the shrub to encourage growth of new twigs. It has been described as being worthy of notice for foresters only because of their use in  forming a scanty cover along dry, rocky borders of streams,  and the wood has been described as being of no economic or domestic use. Cultivation\nCercis occidentalis is cultivated as an ornamental plant and tree, for planting in parks and gardens, and as a street tree. It is also used in drought tolerant, native plant, and wildlife gardens. It is also used as a screen tree.

Rama Rao, Bhanumathi Ramakrishna with music composed by M. B. Sreenivasan, while Bhanumathi supervised. It is a remake of the Bengali film Saat Pake Bandha (1963). Plot\nBharathi is the daughter of retired principal Appa Rao, with values and self-esteem. She and lecturer Chandrashekar fall in love. Bharathi's mother, Manikyamba, does not like this alliance because of its prestige. But Appa Rao convinces her and arranges the marriage of Chandrashekar and Bharathi. After the wedding, Manikyamba constantly criticizes Chandrashekar, so he leaves their house with Bharathi and they live happily. Manikyamba dislikes her daughter's middle-class life. She starts boasting about her son-in-law to the relatives. This hurts Chandrashekar, so he does not want to return to her house, and Bharathi is sandwiched between her mother and husband. Gradually, ego clashes arise between the couple, and they lose tolerance for each other and separate with the intention of divorcing.",

It is in the family Mustelidae and is the lone member of the genus Poecilogale. It has a long, slender body with short legs and a bushy tail. One of the smallest carnivorans in Africa, it measures 24 to 35 cm (9.4 to 13.8 in) long excluding the tail, with males generally larger than females. It has black fur over most of its body, with distinctive white bands running from the top of its head down its back, with the tail being completely white. The closest living relative of this species is the striped polecat, and it may also be related to the extinct Propoecilogale bolti. The African striped weasel is most commonly seen in savanna and veld grasslands with termite mounds, but has also been recorded in semideserts, rainforests, fynbos and even areas used by humans such as pine plantations and agricultural land. It is a powerful digger and excavates burrows which it inhabits.",

Though not commonly seen, it has been listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because of its wide range and habitat tolerance. There are no known major threats to the species, though it is commonly used in local traditional medicine. Owls and domestic dogs are known to prey on it, and weasels sometimes die in fights against each other. This weasel generally flees from any perceived threats, but may try warding off its attacker with noises, fake charges or a noxious fluid sprayed from its perineal glands. African striped weasels are specialized predators that feed almost entirely on rodents, though they occasionally eat birds as well. Even when hungry, they ignore other types of small animals and eggs provided to it as food. This animal commonly bites its prey in the back of the neck while rolling around or kicking the prey's back, likely in an attempt to dislocate the neck. Larger prey may instead be dispatched with bites to the throat, though only females have been observed doing this. This weasel rarely drinks water, only doing so in small quantities when the weather is hot. It is mostly a nocturnal and solitary animal, though small groups of up to four individuals are sometimes seen.",

It is mostly a nocturnal and solitary animal, though small groups of up to four individuals are sometimes seen. Breeding takes place from spring to the end of summer, and two to three young tend to be born per litter after a gestation period of about 30 days. Taxonomy and evolution\nThe African striped weasel was first described in 1864, when British zoologist John Edward Gray studied a skin of the animal purchased by the British Museum ten years earlier that was labeled as that of a  zorilla . He recognized that this skin was unlike that of any other known member of the mustelid family, and determined that it represented a new species which he named Zorilla albinucha. The specific name combines the Latin words albi meaning 'white' and nucha meaning 'nape'. Five years later, Gray published a catalogue of some of the mammal specimens in the British Museum, in which he moved the species into the genus Mustela as Mustela albinucha, commenting that it only has the colouration of a zorilla. In 1883, another British zoologist, Oldfield Thomas, noticed that the species had significant differences in the skull compared to any known mustelid genera. He therefore established the new genus Poecilogale, the sole included species being Poecilogale albinucha.",

Thomas' study was based on five African striped weasel specimens, four of which were kept in the British Museum, with the remaining one in the Paris Museum of Natural History. In 1865, German naturalist Wilhelm Peters reported two mustelid specimens from Golungo Alto, Angola. He described one of them as a new species which he named Zorilla africana, and thought the other should also be considered a variety of this species. However, Austrian explorer Friedrich Welwitsch told him that the latter specimen represents the species named a year earlier as Zorilla albinucha. Welwitsch believed that the two forms were consistently different, and that even the local indigenous population refers to them by different names. In the same year, Portuguese zoologist José Vicente Barbosa du Bocage studied two skins and a skeleton of African striped weasels from Calandula, Angola and proposed that the animal's scientific name be changed to Zorilla flavistriata.",

Some authors believe that the species is monotypic and that all proposed subspecies should be considered invalid. The following five subspecies were recognized in the third edition of Mammal Species of the World, published in 2005:\nEvolution\nThe African striped weasel is the only species in the monotypic genus Poecilogale, which belongs in the subfamily Ictonychinae within the family Mustelidae. Ictonychinae is divided into two tribes, Ictonychini and Lyncodontini. This species is part of Ictonychini, which it shares with the striped polecat, Saharan striped polecat and marbled polecat.

It shows features in its skull and teeth that are intermediate between Ictonyx and Poecilogale, and has been suggested to be an ancestor of the African striped weasel. Fossil specimens of Propoecilogale have been found in the Late Pliocene and Early Pleistocene-aged cave deposits of South Africa, suggesting the animal existed between 2.6 and 1.4 million years ago.

Behaviour and ecology\nThe African striped weasel is a mostly nocturnal animal, though it can sometimes be found at dawn or dusk.

These weasels are effective diggers and construct their own burrows, sometimes working in pairs to do so, using their front limbs to dig into the ground and their hind limbs to kick soil backwards. However, they may sometimes rest in natural cavities such as hollow logs or rock crevices. They defecate in well-defined latrine locations, raising their tails almost vertically when doing so, possibly as a means of scent marking. In the wild, these latrines are commonly at the bases of trees and termite mounds, whereas captive animals may deposit dung against a vertical wall instead. Captive females with nursing young have been recorded to dip their necks into water during very hot weather, which may be to both cool themselves and carry water so that they can moisten and cool their young. Social behaviour and communication\nAfrican striped weasels are generally solitary, but may occasionally be seen in pairs or family groups of up to four individuals. Males are aggressive when they encounter one another, at first bristling up the hair on their tails, making short cries and fake charges, and then escalating to fighting with bites, thrashing, and aggressive shrieks if neither individual retreats.

Young weasels also make distress calls when separated from their mother. Feeding\nAfrican striped weasels are specialist predators known to hunt small mammals and birds, with the vast majority of their diet consisting of rodents of their own size or smaller, and will travel into the burrows of rodents to hunt them. While they occasionally feed on reptiles, insects, and eggs, in experiments conducted during the 1970s, captive striped weasels did not attack or eat several genera of invertebrates (including various insects), reptiles, amphibians and chicken eggs offered to them, even while hungry. The weasels hunt primarily by scent, attacking prey with a sudden lunge and biting onto the back of the neck. After the initial strike, they roll around and kick the prey animal's back or pelvic region, perhaps in order to dislocate the prey's neck (as suggested in 1978 by South African researcher David T. Rowe-Rowe).",

Prey is generally eaten whole while the weasel is in a crouched pose, though the feathers and legs of birds and the stomachs of mammals are sometimes left uneaten. Unlike the related striped polecat, this species does not use its front limbs to stabilize its food while eating. Although African striped weasels eat smaller prey weighing up to 180 g (6.3 oz) head first, larger prey is eaten from the shoulder first. They sometimes store prey in their burrow instead of eating it immediately, picking up small prey by the back skin off the ground and dragging larger prey backwards towards the storage area. The gut of an African striped weasel is between 1.75 and 2 times the length of its body excluding the tail, and food passes through rather quickly, with defecation occurring approximately 165 minutes after the food was consumed. They do not drink frequently, gaining most of their moisture requirements through their food. When they do drink, they do so by lapping up water with their tongues.",

Reproduction\nThe breeding season of the African striped weasel is extensive, lasting from spring to the end of summer. The testes of the male remain large from September to April (spring to early autumn) and are shrunken for the rest of the year. A soft chattering sound, believed to be a greeting call, is emitted by the male when courting a female during this time. If the female is receptive, she may express her receptiveness by moving around him. The male will then gently chew on her cheek, sniff her vulva and hold onto her neck from behind. During mating, the male continues to grip the female's neck from behind while clutching his forelimbs around her pelvic region. The duration of copulation is variable and can be as short as 27 minutes, though it typically lasts between 60 and 80 minutes. At least three bouts of copulation can occur within a day.",

Birth takes place in a burrow during the daytime, and the mother eats the placenta afterwards. The newborn young weigh just 4 g (0.14 oz) each. They are almost hairless, with their pink skin visible over most of the body, a mane of white hair on the back of the head, and a hump which stretches from the back of the head to the shoulders.

Their milk canine teeth grow out at five weeks, at which point they begin eating the soft parts of prey killed by their mother, with permanent canines growing at 11 weeks before the milk canines are shed. Their eyes open at an age of 51 to 54 days. By 11 weeks of age they are weaned (stop drinking milk), and they start killing their own prey at 13 weeks. They reach full adult size at 20 weeks, and are sexually mature at eight months. Mortality and defense\nThe lifespan of the African striped weasel is short, with captive individuals recorded to only live for five or six years. Tuberculosis of the spleen is a common cause of death in some captive weasels. They are also known to kill each other in intraspecific fights (fights with others of their species). Documented predators of wild individuals include owls and domestic dogs, with humans also sometimes trapping and killing them when they visit chicken houses or to use them in traditional medicine. Some fall victim to vehicular collisions, as evidenced by roadkill carcasses found in agricultural areas. The tapeworm Taenia brachyacantha is also a known parasite of the species.",

When startled, African striped weasels attempt to flee by escaping into a hole, or (according to anecdotal evidence) occasionally by climbing up trees. If unable to flee, the animal may emit a sound similar to a growl or shriek while raising its tail and making fake charges at the perceived threat. If this fails, the weasel may spray a yellowish, musky fluid from its perineal glands that can be ejected up to 1 m (3 ft 3 in) away. Though this fluid has a heavy, sweet and pungent smell which has been described as  foul , it apparently is not nauseating and less persistent than the similar secretions of skunks and striped polecats. Conservation\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) first assessed the African striped weasel in 1996 and listed it as a Least Concern species on the IUCN Red List, with the same listing given in subsequent assessments in 2008 and 2015, citing that although it is not commonly seen, it has a wide distribution and habitat tolerance. The IUCN did not make any population estimates for the species, simply stating that the number of mature individuals is unknown, but notes that it is  rare to uncommon .",

Life and work\nHe was the seventh son of a wine grower. After completing his studies in the Roman Catholic Secondary School, he began studies in the University of Pest. The 1848 European revolutions disrupted his studies and due his active participation was imprisoned and after enrolled in the Imperial Army. Finally, he finished his studies graduating in 1854 in the Military Engineering Academy in Vienna. He was teaching in the Vienna's Military School until 1859 when he left the army and returned to Buda where he worked privately as civil engineer until 1861. From 1863 to 1868 he was teaching at secondary schools in Selmecbánya and Pressburg and he wrote some textbooks on mathematics in this level. In 1872 he was appointed professor of mathematics in the university of Kolozsvár. He became rector of the university in 1895 1896 and in his inaugural discourse he spoke about the importance of flights in the transportation of people and goods. He began his research in ballistics in the army, and he followed his theoretical and experimental works in this area all his life.

In terms of law, real relates to land property and is different from personal property, while estate means the  interest  a person has in that land property. Real estate is different from personal property, which is not permanently attached to the land (or comes with the land), such as vehicles, boats, jewelry, furniture, tools, and the rolling stock of a farm and farm animals. In the United States, the transfer, owning, or acquisition of real estate can be through business corporations, individuals, nonprofit corporations, fiduciaries, or any legal entity as seen within the law of each U.S. state. History of real estate\nThe natural right of a person to own property as a concept can be seen as having roots in Roman law as well as Greek philosophy. The profession of appraisal can be seen as beginning in England during the 1500s, as agricultural needs required land clearing and land preparation.

Natural law can be seen as having an influence in Emerich de Vattel's 1758 treatise The Law of Nations which conceptualized the idea of private property. One of the largest initial real estate deals in history known as the  Louisiana Purchase  happened in 1803 when the Louisiana Purchase Treaty was signed. This treaty paved the way for western expansion and made the U.S. the owners of the  Louisiana Territory  as the land was bought from France for fifteen million dollars, making each acre roughly 4 cents. The oldest real estate brokerage firm was established in 1855 in Chicago, Illinois, and was initially known as  L. D. Olmsted   Co. but is now known as  Baird   Warner . In 1908, the National Association of Realtors was founded in Chicago and in 1916, the name was changed to the National Association of Real Estate Boards and this was also when the term  realtor  was coined to identify real estate professionals.",

Housing financing in the U.S. was greatly affected by the Banking Act of 1933 and the National Housing Act in 1934 because it allowed for mortgage insurance for home buyers and this system was implemented by the Federal Deposit Insurance as well as the Federal Housing Administration. In 1938, an amendment was made to the National Housing Act and Fannie Mae, a government agency, was established to serve as a secondary market for mortgages and to give lenders more money in order for new homes to be funded. Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act in the U.S., which is also known as the Fair Housing Act, was put into place in 1968 and dealt with the incorporation of African Americans into neighborhoods as the issues of discrimination were analyzed with the renting, buying, and financing of homes.

Real estate and the environment\nReal estate can be valued or devalued based on the amount of environmental degradation that has occurred. Environmental degradation can cause extreme health and safety risks. There is a growing demand for the use of site assessments (ESAs) when valuing a property for both private and commercial real estate. Environmental surveying is made possible by environmental surveyors who examine the environmental factors present within the development of real estate as well as the impacts that development and real estate has on the environment. Green development is a concept that has grown since the 1970s with the environmental movement and the World Commission on Environment and Development. Green development examines social and environmental impacts with real estate and building. There are 3 areas of focus, being the environmental responsiveness, resource efficiency, and the sensitivity of cultural and societal aspects. Examples of Green development are green infrastructure, LEED, conservation development, and sustainability developments.

Real estate in itself has been measured as a contributing factor to the rise in green house gases. According to the International Energy Agency, real estate in 2019 was responsible for 39 percent of total emissions worldwide and 11 percent of those emissions were due to the manufacturing of materials used in buildings. Development\nReal estate development involves planning and coordinating of housebuilding, real estate construction or renovation projects. Real estate development can be less cyclical than real estate investing. Investment\nIn markets where land and building prices are rising, real estate is often purchased as an investment, whether or not the owner intends to use the property. Often investment properties are rented out, but  flipping  involves quickly reselling a property, sometimes taking advantage of arbitrage or quickly rising value, and sometimes after repairs are made that substantially raise the value of the property. Luxury real estate is sometimes used as a way to store value, especially by wealthy foreigners, without any particular attempt to rent it out. Some luxury units in London and New York City have been used as a way for corrupt foreign government officials and business people from countries without strong rule of law to launder money or to protect it from seizure.

Composed by Sajid Wajid, the song is sung by Arijit Singh, with lyrics penned by Kausar Munir and Danish Sabri. The music video features Varun Dhawan and Ileana D'Cruz. Background\nThe song is composed by Sajid Wajid and rendered by Arijit Singh, marking their first collaboration which is followed by  Raat Bhar  from Heropanti which was released the same year. It is also the first song which features Dhawan in a song sung by Singh, followed by  Samjhawan  from Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania, which was also released on the same year. Singh has performed another track in the album, titled  Shanivaar Raati  a duet with Shalmali Kholgade. The producers of the film capitulating on the popularity of the song  Palat   Tera Hero Idhar Hai  from the soundtrack attached a remix version of it along with the theatrical prints of Ragini MMS 2 which released on 21 March 2014 instead of the theatrical trailer marking the first such instance.",

    "text": "Some critics compared the track,  Palat   Tera Hero Idhar Hai  to the 1981 song,  Jahan Teri Yeh Nazar Hai  from the soundtrack of the film, Kaalia. Talking about the resemblance, Sajid stated:  I won't deny any influence in our work, but I am not sure to what extent it goes . According to him the lyrics and the vibe of the song are similar, though the tune is different. The song was talked for its similarity with many tracks performed by Govinda. The song is directed by David Dhawan who is contributed by his elder son, Rohit. The lyrics of the song is penned by Kausar Munir who stated;   To crack this very simple yet catchy and populist vibe is hard, and I don't understand the game of hits and flops . Additional lyrics of the song is penned by Danish Sabri. Since the song required Dhawan to involve a lot of heavy duty steps on the ground with body weight balanced on the hands solely and to avoid any injuries to his wrist and hand, he suggested wearing biker's gloves. The promotional released music video features, Nargis Fakhri through various snippets from the film and songs like  Galat Baat Hai  and  Shanivaar Raat . However the video used in the movie, features Varun Dhawan and Ileana D'Cruz with no frames of Fakhri.",

    "text": "Creators: The Past is an Italian science fiction fantasy film directed by Piergiuseppe Zaia, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Eleonora Fani and composed the soundtrack. The film stars Eleonora Fani, Jennifer Mischiati, Bruce Payne, and Per Fredrik Åsly in the lead roles, and features guest appearances by Gérard Depardieu and William Shatner. The story is about how the destinies of mankind are being manipulated by a race of powerful extraterrestrials known as the Creators. The film was announced as the first part of a planned trilogy, whose next two installments would have been Creators: The Present and Creators: The Future. Principal photography began in 2014, but the film did not reach theaters before 2020. Its release in Italy suffered from the COVID-19 pandemic and it flopped at the box office. The film later generated some curiosity in Italy due to the script's allusions to conspiracy theories. Plot\nThe film provides a fictional explanation as to why the Mayan prophecy did not come to pass. As the end of the year 2012 arrives, the universe is about to undergo an extraordinary planetary alignment which will cause a total eclipse to be visible from planet Earth. The eight members of the Galactic Council regulating the stability of the universe gather to discuss the effects of the coming alignment.",

The film's production also received support from the province's Confederation of Industry branch. Gérard Depardieu's involvement in the production reportedly played an important role in gaining support from public authorities in the Biella province. Michel J. Vandewalle, who had been an executive producer on Iron Sky (2012), worked on the film in a similar capacity. The film's budget was reported to be about 8 million euros. Part of the funding came from contributions by businesses from the Biella province, who were incited to invest a minimum of 12,500 euros. Some businesses reportedly invested hundreds of thousands. In Canavese, private individuals reportedly invested in the picture through their banker. The production company was also granted a tax credit of over 765, 000 euros by the Italian ministry of culture. In 2021, after the film had been completed and released, the ministry granted the production company an incentive of about 389,000 euros, plus 71,000 euros to compensate for the COVID-related difficulties.

The film then remained entirely unavailable for over two years, generating some interest from Italian reviewers. On February 7, 2023, it was released to streaming on Amazon Prime, licensed exclusively in Italy and Vatican City, with only Italian dubs. A DVD, also with the Italian version, was released in 2023. The English-language version was later released on Amazon's video rental services. Reception\nGiancarlo Zappoli of mymovies.it stated that the film's two strengths were its notable cast and the foray into fantasy and sci-fi (unusual for contemporary Italian films) but that the screenplay suffered from an abundance of subplots.

Fiaba Di Martino of Film TV magazine criticized the screenplay and the underwritten characters, and compared the movie to an overenthusiastic fan film made for YouTube. Martina Catrambone of themacguffin.it wrote that the writing, editing, music, and special effects did not make any sense, and stated that such a film proved that Italian cinema should avoid science fiction. Alberto Mutignani of the online magazine The Walk of Fame called it  the worst film of the year , stating that the film ended up being an unintentional comedy, with a story so confusing that one wondered if some scenes were missing. Creators: the Past ranked ninth at the Italian box office during its first weekend, earning 69,000 euros.

In January 2021, director Piergiuseppe Zaia stated that despite the film's aborted release, he and Fani were working on what would be the second installment of the trilogy. However, his production company, Artuniverse, was liquidated in December 2023 due to its inability to generate revenues. In 2025, Zaia said that he was no longer involved in filmmaking. Controversies\nUpon the film's release, a reviewer noted that the story alluded to all sorts of conspiracy theories, as evidenced by the cameo of author Mauro Biglino. Since the film became available again, it has gained minor  cult  status in Italy due to its conspiracist content. After the film's 2020 release, Eleonora Fani gained some following on YouTube and Telegram, publishing videos where she appeared to take seriously the film's content, including theories about ancient astronauts. She went on to publish geopolitical content that praised Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, and to promote QAnon-influenced conspiracy theories.",

Nomenclature\nIn 2019, the Republic of the Union of Myanmar was assigned to giving the HD 18742 system a proper name as part of the IAU100 NameExoWorlds Project, planned to celebrate the hundredth anniversary of the International Astronomical Union (IAU), which grants the right to name an exoplanetary system to every state and territory in the world. Names were submitted and selected within Myanmar, which were then presented to the IAU to be officially recognized. On 17 December 2019, the IAU announced that HD 18742 and its confirmed planet, b, were named Ayeyarwady and Bagan, respectively. Ayeyarwady was named after a river of the same name, the longest and most important river in Myanmar. Bagan refers to one of the ancient cities of the country located right beside the Ayeyarwady, which was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2019.

    "text": "Planetary system\nIn 2011, radial-velocity observations made at the W. M. Keck Observatory revealed the existence of one exoplanet around HD 18742. The planet, HD 18742, is thought to be a gas giant with a minimum mass of 3.362 MJ, which orbits its host star at a distance of 1.82 AU once every 766 days (2.10 years). Its orbit is nearly circular (i.e., with a low eccentricity), similar to planets in the Solar System. Other than the doppler shifts caused by HD 18742 b, radial-velocity measurements used to discover the planet also included an additional linear trend. Utilizing data gathered at the Keck Observatory between 2007 and 2015, Luhn et al. subtracted the effects of HD 18742 b from the radial-velocity curve, revealing a 900-day-period signal, possibly caused by another similar planet. Though the existence of such a planet would provide a far better match to the observed curve, this signal remains a planetary candidate since it would be in a 9:10 resonance with HD 18742 b, a non-physical resonance that is previously unheard of. Follow-up observations are expected to show the true nature of the system.",

    "text": "DUMBA was a collective living space and anarchist, queer, all-ages community center and venue in Brooklyn, New York. DUMBA (a feminized version of DUMBO Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass, the name of its NYC neighborhood) became a radical cultural nexus point around which the Queercore movement flourished and an independent film scene developed. It was the site of many notable events, as well as being a residence for a few dozen people over the years. DUMBA was a unique experiment providing a combination of live music and disc jockeys (usually several DJs a night), film screenings of Super 8 and 16mm films, video, artwork, performances, vegetarian food, and an unrestricted erotic atmosphere. Background and history\nDUMBA was founded in a loft, during the summer of 1996 by a group of people which included filmmaker Scott Berry, Kelly Besser, Vincent Baker, and others. It would come to call itself the  DUMBA Collective  by around 2000. The group's name, DUMBA, is derived from DUMBO, the neighborhood between Fulton Landing and Vinegar Hill. The 5,000-square-foot (460 m2) loft used for the collective's space was commercially zoned under the Manhattan Bridge overpass and housed six or seven residents between the years 1996 and 2006. It has been described as  a maze of rooms small and large .",

Projects and Productions\nDUMBA first became known for putting on all-ages punk shows, which were promoted by word of mouth and simple photocopied flyers displaying a DIY aesthetic. Diana Morrow designed several of the flyers. Bands and performers who played DUMBA include The Need, Los Crudos, Limp Wrist, Nedra Johnson, The Spaceheads, Bitch and Animal, Octant, God Is My Co-Pilot, Tribe 8, Three Dollar Bill, Kaia, Patsy, The Lookers, and many more. In time, the venue began to feature more diverse performances by artists such as Vaginal Davis. Fuck the Mayor Collective\nDUMBA was also involved in the Fuck the Mayor Collective, a queer activist organization created in response to what some believed were the racist, classist, sexist, and homophobic policies of the Giuliani administration.

Brooklyn Babylon Cinema\nBrooklyn Babylon Cinema, a recurring analog film screening series, was born at DUMBA and continued for several years. It featured events such as the  Times Square Sinema  on May 7, 1999, which provided a kissing booth and encouraged fraternization; a tribute to the Deuce's seedy past; and  Caught Looking  (March 2000), a program about voyeurism curated by Aaron Scott, which included two video programs, as well as installations by Rob Roth and others.

These parties were deemed successful and were written about in Village Voice several times, notably by Guy Trebay and by Taormino, though several years after the fact. The Lusty Loft Parties were part of the basis for the film Shortbus. The DUMBA Collective\nAround 2000, the group living in the space called themselves the  DUMBA Collective,  a name that stuck until the collective's demise in 2006. In 2004, writer Arial Levy described in New York Magazine DUMBA's trannyboi scene:\nBeing a boi means different things to different people it s a fluid identity, and that s the whole point. Some women who call themselves bois are playing off  boy  in the gay-male S M sense of the term, as in Daddy Boy: The boy or boi is the submissive and, in the case of lesbians, has sex with dominant butches (tops).",

Shortbus\nJohn Cameron Mitchell's film Shortbus (2006) was partially shot at DUMBA in 2005. The  Lusty Loft Parties  are credited as the events on which he loosely based his movie.

His family emigrated to Canada in 1910 and he attended secondary school in Saskatoon, going on to the University of Saskatchewan, where he was awarded BA in 1927. He began working for the YMCA as boys  work secretary in Saskatoon in 1922, later becoming an Army physical education instructor. At the outbreak of World War II he went with the 1st Canadian Division to England as a YMCA Auxiliary Service officer, returning later on to Canada to train others. War service\nIn 1941 Porteous was posted with the Winnipeg Grenadiers to Hong Kong, to reinforce the British garrison. The regiment arrived just in time to be overwhelmed by invading Japanese forces, and Porteous was to spend a total of 44 months in one of the notorious prisoner of war camps, where he remained until the end of the war. In due course he was decorated as an MBE, Member of the Order of the British Empire, for his outstanding contribution in maintaining prisoner morale while imprisoned. Honours\nPorteous returned to Saskatoon after the war and was named executive director of the Saskatoon Community Chest.",

    "text": "Honours\nPorteous returned to Saskatoon after the war and was named executive director of the Saskatoon Community Chest. He was later awarded the Order of Canada in 1974 for dedication to community affairs, and was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of Saskatchewan, the Queen s representative, on 3 March 1976, thus becoming that Province's 14th Lieutenant Governor. He died in office on 6 February 1978. Medical research\nAn interesting insight into Porteous' experience is that from 1960 until his death in 1978 Porteous was an enthusiastic advocate of the medical benefits of niacin. Dr. Abram Hoffer had approached him to request that he recommend it to the senior citizens in the social housing development which Porteous administered. Hoffer believed large doses of niacin, up to six grams a day, could retard the development and even reverse senility, as it dilates the blood vessels, thus improving circulation. Porteous insisted he would not recommend anything to anyone which he had not first tried himself. For six months, he took the six grams a day and then recommended it to the senior citizens without reservation. As he told the Department of Veterans Affairs doctor on his next annual visit (he was on a 100  disability pension) that he had not felt as well since before the war; he could even touch his hands together above his head, not having been able to raise them above his shoulders before the treatment.",

    "text": "Kristina Wong, Sweatshop Overlord is a 2021 American play by Kristina Wong. Its premise is based on Wong's experience organizing hundreds of volunteers to sew masks amid the COVID-19 pandemic, calling themselves the  Auntie Sewing Squad . Over the course of the play, Wong uses comedy to address themes such as the often unattainable nature of the American Dream, anti-Asian racism in the U.S. caused by the pandemic, and the invisible labor of women and people and color. The play was a finalist for the 2022 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, and won the Lucille Lortel Award, Drama Desk Award, and Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Solo Show. Synopsis\nDuring the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, Kristina Wong begins sewing masks from old bedsheets and bra straps on her Hello Kitty sewing machine. She quickly organizes the Auntie Sewing Squad, a network of hundreds of volunteers including children and her mother working from home to produce masks and address gaps in the U.S. public health system. As the project grows, Wong reflects on the blurred line between mutual aid and cult-like dedication. As demand for masks declines and pandemic restrictions ease, Wong navigates life after leading the group, exploring the challenges of rebuilding personal and communal connections. The performance combines humor and generosity, inviting the audience to witness Wong s efforts to foster community during isolation while reflecting on the pandemic s broader social impact.",

Offseason\nDuring the off-season, Cincinnati hired Bill McKechnie to manage the club. McKechnie had extensive major league experience as a manager, as he most recently managed the Boston Bees from 1930 to 1937, leading the club to a 560 666 over eight seasons. McKechnie also managed the St. Louis Cardinals from 1928 to 1929, leading the team to a 129 88 record and winning the 1928 National League pennant. McKechnie had his most success as manager with the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1922 to 1926, as he earned a 409 293 record. McKechnie managed the Pirates to the 1925 National League pennant, and won the 1925 World Series as Pittsburgh defeated the Washington Senators in seven games. On October 4, 1937, the Reds released outfielder Kiki Cuyler following the 1937 season. Cuyler spent three seasons in Cincinnati, where he batted .293 with nine home runs, 128 RBI and 30 stolen bases in 323 games.

    "text": "The Seven Minutes is a 1971 American legal drama film directed and produced by Russ Meyer. The movie was based on the 1969 novel of the same name by Irving Wallace. Plot\nAfter a teenager, Jerry Griffith (John Sarno), who purchased the erotic novel The Seven Minutes is charged with rape, an eager prosecutor who is against pornography (and preparing for an upcoming election) uses the scandal to declare the book as obscene, sets up a sting operation where two detectives enter a bookstore and purchase a copy of the eponymous book, then the prosecutor brings charges against the bookstore for selling obscene material. The trial soon creates a heated debate about the issue of pornography vs. free speech. The young defense lawyer, Mike Barrett, must also solve the mystery of the novel's true author. In examining the history of the book, the defense attorney discovered it was written by J.J. Jadway, an American expatriate living in Europe. The book was originally published in English by a publisher in France, and eventually picked up by various tawdry publishing companies in the United States, most of whom tried to emphasize the more lurid and salacious aspects of the book. Its content was considered so sexually explicit that it was banned as obscene in over 30 countries. Apparently. J.J. Jadway was so despondent over the treatment of his book that he committed suicide; one of his friends found him and reported it.",

    "text": "Apparently. J.J. Jadway was so despondent over the treatment of his book that he committed suicide; one of his friends found him and reported it. As the trial takes place, the prosecutor finds ordinary members of the public who find the book grossly offensive (one of whom admits on cross-examination by the defense that she cannot even repeat out loud one of the words used in the book to describe what the female protagonist was doing in bed with her lover), and the defense finds professionals in academia and the media who attest to the book's value as literature. The prosecution then puts the young man who committed the rape on the stand to say the book drove him to it. The attorney defending the book is contacted by Constance Cumberland, a member of a local decency society who decides to testify in court about the young man who committed the rape and other things surrounding the book.

He had been harassed for years by various amateur and professional vigilantes, and intended The Seven Minutes as his statement against censorship. The result, whatever it was, was not a Russ Meyer film in the classical vein. Ebert admitted there were some nice touches like making a U.S. Senator from California a woman played by Yvonne De Carlo  but Meyer's main thrust seemed to be to bring The Seven Minutes to the screen more or less faithfully and seriously, and I think that was a mistake.

A charge imposed by the state of Victoria on zero and low emission vehicles (ZLEVs) was ruled invalid on the grounds that it imposed a duty of excise as defined by Section 90 of the Constitution. It overruled Dickenson's Arcade Pty Ltd v Tasmania, and imposed a broad view of an excise as defined by Section 90. Facts\nThe Zero and Low Emission Vehicle Distance-based Charge Act 2021, which came into effect on 1 July 2021, imposed a charge on the use of electric, hydrogen, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (collectively referred to as ZLEVs) on Victorian roads. The charge was 2.5 cents per kilometre for electric and hydrogen vehicles, and 2.0 cents per kilometre for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. The charge was introduced to ensure ZLEV owners paid for the maintenance of the road network, as ZLEVs would not be subject to the fuel excise. In September of 2021, Melbourne ZLEV drivers Chris Vanderstock and Kathleen Davies, represented by Equity Generation Lawyers, launched a challenge against the constitutional validity of the law, arguing that the Victorian law created a tax of consumption on ZLEVs, which would be a duty of excise and exclusive to the Commonwealth under Section 90 of the Constitution.",

The majority ruled that Dickenson's Arcade Pty Ltd v Tasmania, which held that a tax on goods at the stage of consumption did not constitute an excise, should be reopened and overruled. Kiefel CJ, Gageler, and Gleeson JJs found that the nature of Victoria's ZLEV charge would inherently  dampen demand  for ZLEVs, as the charge applied to almost all uses of ZLEVs on Victorian roads, and therefore the Victorian charge was a tax and a duty of excise. Jagot J, concurring with the Court's ruling, agreed that the Victorian ZLEV charge was a tax, and thus could not be imposed on the state level, distinguishing it from a  fee for service , such as a license or permit fee.

Edelman J wrote that the definition of excise that the majority had adopted had no basis in past rulings, serving as a  neglect of precedent . He believed that the Victorian charge was not a consumption tax, and aimed to have the same effect as a fuel excise. However, he stated that the ZLEV charge differed from a fuel excise in that it was not levied at the point of sale. Edelman J argued that the ZLEV charge was  unlikely to have any real and substantial effect  on demand for ZLEVs. Steward J disagreed with the Court's view that the ZLEV charge was a tax on goods and therefore an excise, writing that the charge had  the character of a direct tax .

The Court's ruling was immediately noted to have severely effected the vertical fiscal imbalance between the Commonwealth and the states. Similar charges planned to be introduced by New South Wales and Western Australia were likely prohibited, and the constitutionality of other state-imposed road user charges, such as motor vehicle duties and vehicle registration charges, could be brought into question. Every state and territory government had submitted in support of Victoria in the case. Victorian treasurer Tim Pallas argued that the Court had redefined an excise to mean  a tax on anything , suggesting that other state charges could be challenged under the Court's ruling. He emphasised the need to  secure the state s revenue base  through legislative changes and collaboration with the Commonwealth. New South Wales Premier Chris Minns stated that the decision in Vanderstock had  caught everyone off guard , adding that the funding of future road projects in New South Wales may have to be re-examined due to the state's reliance on road user charges.",

These areas of descending air are thought to be essential in the production of many supercellular tornadoes. Large hail within the rear flank downdraft often shows up brightly as a hook on weather radar images, producing the characteristic hook echo, which often indicates the presence of a tornado. Formation\nThe rear flank downdraft can arise owing to negative buoyancy, which can be generated by cold anomalies produced at the rear of the supercell thunderstorm by evaporative cooling of precipitation or hail melting, or injection of dry and cooler air in the cloud, and by vertical perturbation pressure gradients that can arise from vertical gradients of vertical vorticity, stagnation of environmental flow at an updraft, and pressure perturbations due to vertical buoyancy variations (which are partially due to hydrostatic effects). Vertical pressure perturbations are generated by the buildup of pressure due to the vertical buoyancy, creating a pressure perturbation gradient. The subsiding air is generally dry and as it subsides the air warms adiabatically and can form a clearing in the cloud cover called a clear slot. A clear slot can be observed to wrap around a tornado or form away from a tornado in the shape of a horseshoe. This clearing is most likely the formation of the hook echo region associated with tornado formation.",

This clearing is most likely the formation of the hook echo region associated with tornado formation. An RFD originating in dry air warming adiabatically can produce warmer observations out of the RFD at the surface. Thermodynamic characteristics\nRFDs may present themselves as a clear slot wrapping itself at least two-thirds of the way around the tornado, but the clear slot is not always evident in cases where an RFD is present. Many documents indicate that surface pressure excesses up to a few millibars exist within RFDs. Some findings showed that within the RFDs equivalent potential temperature (θe) is cold with respect to the inflow. Moreover, the lowest wet-bulb potential temperature (θw) values observed at the surface were within the RFD. There are, however, also observations of warm, high-θe air within RFDs. Difference from forward flank downdraft\nCompared to the forward flank downdraft (FFD) the rear flank downdraft (RFD) consists of warm and dry air. This is because the RFD is forced down from the mid-levels of the atmosphere, resulting in compressional heating of downward moving parcels.",

The FFD, in contrast, is driven by precipitation loading and evaporative cooling in the precipitation core of a supercell thunderstorm, making the FFD relatively cold and wet. Both are thought to be significant in tornado formation. Role in tornadogenesis\nAssociation with hook echo\nRear-flank downdrafts have a well-established association with hook echoes. Firstly, the initial rear flank downdraft is air from aloft transported down to the surface by colliding and mixing with the storm. Secondly, hook echoes form through advection of precipitation from the rear of the main echo around the region of strong updraft. Thus, precipitation loading and evaporation cooling induced by the hook echo can enhance the downdraft. Some observations showed the presence of an enhanced downdraft in the vicinity of the strongest low-level rotation, behind the main storm updraft. Dry environmental air is also entrained into the downdraft and evaporative cooling helps create more negatively buoyant air. As precipitation falls and cool entrained air circulated downward and eventually reaching the surface. This contributes to the circulation to form a hook echo. It was concluded the presence of a hook echo can reflect downdraft intensification.",

It was concluded the presence of a hook echo can reflect downdraft intensification. Association with tornadoes\nMany researchers have realized that rear flank downdrafts, especially those associated with hook echoes, are fundamentally critical to tornado formation (tornadogenesis). In 1975, Ted Fujita originated the recycling hypothesis of tornadogenesis: First, downdraft air is recirculated into the (developing) tornado, which results in an appreciable convergence on the back side of the (still developing) tornado. Then the downward transport of the angular momentum by precipitation, and the recycling of air into the tornado, will create a tangential acceleration required for the intensification of the tornado as a positive feedback loop. Observations of low-level vorticity couplets within RFDs indicate that tilting of vorticity by the RFD is important in the formation of tornadoes within supercell storms. During the tornadogenesis phase in supercells, the parcels of air infiltrating the tornado or incipient tornado regularly seem to pass through the hook echo and RFD, which can serve as the basis for Fujita's recycling hypothesis. Furthermore, observations of the clear slot during and just prior to the tornadic stage, imply the air infiltrating the tornado may come from the RFD.",

Regularly, generation of large vertical vorticity close to the surface in an environment which is required for tornadogenesis, is attributed to downdraft. Tornadoes may arise, however, in the absence of a downdraft in environments containing preexisting vertical vorticity at the surface, such as in some cases of nonsupercell tornadogenesis. Downdraft may have the following roles in near-ground mesocyclogenesis: \ntilts horizontal vorticity to produce vertical vorticity\ntransports air containing vertical vorticity from mid-level to the surface\nenhances the near-ground vorticity convergence beneath the updraft tremendously by entering the updraft and stretching vertically\nSee also\nHook echo\nSupercell\nThunderstorm\nTornado\nVertical draft\nReferences\nBibliography\nWallace; Hobbs (2006).

Built in the 1860s, this Second Empire house is a remnant survivor of a series of fashionable mid-19th century Victorian houses, known as  Doctor's Row . The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. It is now used for professional offices. Description and history\nThe Haven House is set on the north side of Pleasant Street, just west of the Malden Center MBTA station. Its historic position was at the head of a series of similar houses along Pleasant Street, which is now lined mainly with commercial buildings. The house is a 2 1 2-story wood-frame structure, topped with a slate mansard roof and resting on a granite foundation. The roof is pierced in several places by round-arch dormers, including a doubled one above the main entrance. The walls are finished in flushboard, with quoined corners. The front facade is three bays wide, with the central bay covered by a projecting glassed-in porch two stories in height. The flanking bays each have a projecting bay window on the first floor. Roof lines of the main roof, porch, and bays are dentillated and studded with brackets. An addition to the building, made during its 1989 restoration, was done in a stylistically sensitive way.",

A later resident was William Ferguson, a railroad contractor who laid miles of track in Malden and adjacent towns. In the early 1900s a large number of doctors lived in the area, including in this house, leading the neighborhood to be dubbed  Doctor's Row .

    "text": "This is a list of English words that may be of Etruscan origin, and were borrowed through Latin, often via French. The Etruscan origin of most of these words is disputed, and some may be of Indo-European or other origin. The question is made more complex by the fact that the Etruscans borrowed many Greek words in modified form. Typically if a Latin word has an unknown, uncertain or disputed origin, it is considered a possible candidate for deriving in whole or in part from an Etruscan word; however, native Etruscan must then be distinguished from Greek. If no Etruscan word is clearly identifiable sometimes an attempt is made to reconstruct one. Etruscan derivations therefore are highly variable in probability; that is, some are highly speculative and others more likely.

He also first described the amphipod crustacean Oniscus arenarius (1769), today known as Haustorius arenarius, and Phtisica marina, commonly known as the 'ghost shrimp'. He also described the dubious ctenophore Callianira hexagona. Martinus Slabber had a taxidermy collection, mostly consisting of birds, which he sold to the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie in Leiden in 1824. He also was known to have a small but renowned painting collection.",

Goeken founded multiple communications companies, often pursuing innovative technologies despite significant skepticism and resistance. He was the founder of Microwave Communications Inc. in the early 1960s, initially established to support the sale of two-way radios. The company would go on to play a major role in transforming the U.S. telecommunications industry by introducing lower-cost long-distance telephone service for consumers and businesses. Other ventures included Airfone and In-Flight Phone, which were instrumental in developing air-to-ground telephone systems, as well as the digital network later adopted by FTD florists. Early life and education\nJohn D. Goeken was born on August 22, 1930, in Joliet, Illinois. His father was a Lutheran minister. Career\nMCI Communications\nGoeken founded his company, originally named Microwave Communications Inc., after leaving the Army, where he had gained experience with microwave technology. At the time, truckers traveling between Chicago and St. Louis were unable to use two-way radios over long distances due to limited signal range. Goeken addressed this by building a network of microwave towers along the route to relay signals.

The company faced opposition from established telecommunications firms, which filed challenges with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Despite this, the FCC granted MCI the right to compete with AT T for long-distance service in 1971. In 1974, MCI filed an antitrust lawsuit against AT T, alleging anti-competitive practices. The lawsuit initiated the process that ultimately led to the breakup of AT T. It resulted in a settlement under which AT T agreed to divest its local telephone operations, culminating in its breakup in 1984. Goeken left MCI in 1974 following a disagreement with William G. McGowan, whom he had brought on to help raise capital. Goeken favored focusing on business clients, while McGowan steered the company toward consumer services. McGowan later became chairman of MCI Communications, while Goeken retained an ownership stake after his departure. Airfone\nDespite widespread skepticism about the demand for in-flight communication, Goeken founded Airfone, a company providing air-to-ground telephone service.

After selling Airfone Corp. to GTE Corp., Goeken alleged that GTE breached their contract by not allowing him to run the company as he saw fit, and he asked a court to void his non-compete agreement. A court agreed, and Goeken then founded In-Flight Phone Corporation in Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois, with the intent of competing with GTE Airfone, which held a monopoly on air-to-ground telecommunications. In 1990, the FCC approved Goeken's plan to share the Airfone frequencies, and solicited applications for and subsequently issued licences to several companies to operate digital Terrestrial Aeronautical Public Correspondence (TAPC) services. In-Flight Phone Corp. was awarded one of these licenses, and Goeken was clear to compete with GTE Airfone. In-Flight Phone Corporation attracted more than  200 million from investors, and Goeken set out to build the first nationwide digital air-to-ground telecommunications network, capable of delivering static-free telephone calls, internet service and information services, to airplane seats.

The Team\nPrior to the team leaving for Rio, they visited the Namibia Sport Commission. The team departed for Rio on August 29. The team included 9 athletes, 4 guides and 7 officials. The team's Chef de Mission was Nicklaus Nghumoono. The team manager was Iitwayi Johannes. The team administrator was Memory Kahlari. The flag bearer was sprinter and long-jumper Johanna Benson. Benson won the country's first Paralympic gold and silver medal. Funding and support\nThe Ministry of Sport, Youth and National Service in Namibia was expected to fund several intensive training camps in preparation for Rio. The Paralympic movement in the country is largely dependent on the government for financial and other support, as the private sector has not contributed much to Paralympic sportspeople's efforts. Additional private funding for the national team came from Coca-Cola, Seaflower and Miss Namibia 2015. Athlete Ananias Shikongo raised funds through a personal crowd funding campaign to finance his preparation. Promotional events to support Paralympic efforts were scheduled to take place around the country in the lead up to Rio.",

Disability classifications\nEvery participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.

    "text": "Gather Yourselves Together is an early novel by the science fiction author Philip K. Dick, written around 1948 1950, and published posthumously by WCS Books in 1994. As with many of his early books which were considered unsuitable for publication when they were first submitted as manuscripts, this was not science fiction, but rather a work of straight literary fiction. The manuscript was 481 pages in length. At the time it was published, it was one of only two Dick novels for which the manuscript was known to exist which remained unpublished. The other, Voices from the Street, was published in 2007. Dwight Brown wrote the afterword. As of 2011, the original hardcover edition was out of print; in July 2012, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt released a trade paperback edition of Gather Yourselves Together, complete with Brown's afterword. Plot summary\nAmerican Metals Development Company ( the Company ) maintains an industrial site in China near the Indian border. After Mao Zedong's Communists proclaim the People's Republic of China in 1949, the Company's Chinese assets are seized. The Company negotiates safe passage for its workers out of the country provided three people remain to hand the factory over to the Communists when they arrive.",

Three workers are chosen at random: the bitter 24-year-old Barbara Mahler; the cynical, older ex-radio host Verne Tildon; and the curious, naive 23-year-old Carl Fitter. Four years earlier, at a resort town near Boston named Castle, Barbara lost her virginity to Verne. In the present, Barbara holds a grudge against Verne, believing he took advantage of her at a young age. They have sex again out of boredom, after which Barbara is frightened by a ghost which she takes a sign to move on from Verne. Barbara begins seducing Carl, who is more interested in exploring the factory and reading his handwritten volume of personal philosophy to her. A representative from the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Harry Liu, arrives at the site ahead of time. While talking to him, Verne makes an analogy that the trio are the last of the old world, like Romans near the end of the empire, and the Chinese are like the first Christians at the beginning of the new world. They debate if the Communist regime's promises are empty or not, with Harry believing that some degree of myth and untruth is necessary for social organising. Verne gives Harry his pipe lighter as a present  from the old world to the new , which Harry destroys as he leaves.",

Life\nHis birth name was Nicholas, but contemporaries (even in official documents) exclusively called him  Kónya  after his drooping ears (lit. lekonyuló ). He was born into the powerful Szécsényi family as the eldest son of Thomas Szécsényi, Voivode of Transylvania and his first wife, an unidentified daughter of nobleman Paul Visontai from the gens Aba. His brothers were prelate Michael, Bishop of Vác then Eger, and Stephen, who was mentioned only once in 1331. After their mother's death, Thomas Szécsényi married to Anne, Duchess of Auschwitz. The marriage produced further three children, but all of them (Kónya's half-siblings: Caspar, Ladislaus I and Anne) died in their childhood.

After her brother Wulfing II was killed in the Siege of Zadar (1346) and left no male heirs, King Louis granted the status of a son to Elizabeth in 1347, authorizing her to inherit her father's landed property. As a result of this, Szécsényi acquired the castle of Ecseg and other estates through his wife, which after then belonged to the Hollókő lordship (and soon it was demolished by the Szécsényis themselves).

FGF18 and sprifermin act via the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR) family, with preferential activity via FGFR3c. Osteoarthritis\nIn 2020, Merck reported 5-year follow-up data from the Phase 2 clinical trial for knee osteoarthritis (OA). The placebo controlled, multi-center study demonstrated that sprifermin was able to promote statistically significant improvement in cartilage thickness relative to control in a dose-dependent manner, meeting the primary endpoint of the study. The findings suggested the ability of FGF18 to arrest progression to joint replacement, with 0  of patients in the high dose group progressing to Total Knee Replacement (TKR) surgery over the 5 year study period; in contrast, nearly 1 in 10 patients of the high risk subgroup progressed to TKR when treated with the placebo.

    "text": "The Boca Beacon is an American newspaper based in Boca Grande. The paper was founded in 1980 by Marnie Banks, but currently the newspaper is owned by Hopkins   Daughter Publishing. The newspapers headquarters are at 431 Park Avenue Boca Grande, FL 33921. History\nThe newspaper was founded by Marnie Banks, with some help from Jack Harper, in 1980. It was first published from the old Kuhl house on Palm Avenue and printed in Clearwater. Afterwards, in May 1980 Banks's parents aided her to buy Jack Harper out. Banks then extended the newspaper's reach to the surrounding barrier islands, Placida and Cape Haze. At that time there were about 1,150 people subscribed to the newspaper. As time went on Banks wanted the Boca Beacon to become a weekly paper. However, she knew that it would take too much work and had realized that there were other goals that she wanted to pursue and decided to find a new owner for the newspaper. On July 27, 1988, the ownership of the newspaper transitioned to Dusty Hopkins and Terry Hopkins. Terry Hopkins had extensive experience in newspaper business and had just left Fort Myers News Press that same year. In addition, both Terry and Dusty Hopkins had worked for newspapers in August, Portland and Waterville, Maine as well as in New York at The Ithaca Journal, in Washington D.C. and Connecticut.",

He was the younger son and successor of Gregory the Illuminator, the founder and first head of the Armenian Church and his wife, Julitta (or Mariam) of Armenia. Most of the information about Aristaces's life comes from the fifth-century Armenian history attributed to Agathangelos. Aristaces was born in Caesarea of Cappadocia to Gregory the Illuminator and his wife Julitta (or Mariam) of Armenia. He is said to have entered a monastery with his mother as a child after his father left for Armenia. When Aristaces grew up, he went under the tutelage of a monk called Nicomachus, who sent him to live as an ascetic in the desert. Around 325, when Gregory wished to give up the Catholicosate in favor of a life as a hermit, King Tiridates III of Armenia sent for Aristaces and his brother Vrtanes and had them brought to Armenia to take over leadership of the Church.",

Aristaces is also said to have participated in an embassy together with Gregory and King Tiridates to the newly converted Roman emperor Constantine the Great, although this is considered  purely legendary  by scholar Robert W.

Faustus of Byzantium writes that Aristaces died  a confessor's death  but gives no further details, while Movses Khorenatsi claims that he was murdered in Sophene by a governor named Archilaeus in retaliation for being reprimanded by the Catholicos. According to Khorenatsi and Faustus, Aristaces was buried in the town of Til in the district of Acilisene, although in a different chapter Faustus gives the alternative burial site of Tordan in the district of Daranali, where Gregory is said to have been buried.

In 1878 was awarded a doctorate in astronomy from the Humboldt University of Berlin with a thesis titled Untersuchungen über die Ptolemäische Theorie der Mondbewegung (Investigations into the Ptolemaic theory of lunar movement). On 1 July the same year he became an assistant at the Astrophysical Institute Potsdam. Early in his career as an astronomer he aided German solar astronomer Gustav Spörer in his work to observe sun spot activity. Kempf joined an 1882 German expedition to Chile to observe the transit of Venus across the Sun. He was then part of solar eclipse missions to Russia in 1887 and 1914. In 1886, he was promoted to full astronomer and began a collaboration with his friend, German astronomer Gustav Müller to perform a massive survey of northern stars with magnitudes brighter than 7.5 found in the Bonner Durchmusterung.

Glutathione reductase (EC 1.8.1.7) catalyzes the reduction of glutathione disulfide (GSSG) to the sulfhydryl form glutathione (GSH), which is a critical molecule in resisting oxidative stress and maintaining the reducing environment of the cell. Glutathione reductase functions as dimeric disulfide oxidoreductase and utilizes an FAD prosthetic group and NADPH to reduce one molar equivalent of GSSG to two molar equivalents of GSH:\nThe glutathione reductase is conserved between all kingdoms. In bacteria, yeasts, and animals, one glutathione reductase gene is found; however, in plant genomes, two GR genes are encoded. Drosophila and trypanosomes do not have any GR at all. In these organisms, glutathione reduction is performed by either the thioredoxin or the trypanothione system, respectively.

It can scavenge hydroxyl radicals, singlet oxygen, and various electrophiles. Reduced glutathione reduces the oxidized form of the enzyme glutathione peroxidase, which in turn reduces hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a dangerously reactive species within the cell. In addition, it plays a key role in the metabolism and clearance of xenobiotics, acts as a cofactor in certain detoxifying enzymes, participates in transport, and regenerates antioxidants such and Vitamins E and C to their reactive forms. The ratio of GSSG GSH present in the cell is a key factor in properly maintaining the oxidative balance of the cell, that is, it is critical that the cell maintains high levels of the reduced glutathione and a low level of the oxidized glutathione disulfide. This narrow balance is maintained by glutathione reductase, which catalyzes the reduction of GSSG to GSH. Structure\nGlutathione reductase from human erythrocytes is a homodimer consisting of 52kDa monomers, each containing 3 domains.

GR is a thermostable protein, retaining function up to 65  C. Reaction mechanism\nSteps:\nReductive half\nThe action of GR proceeds through two distinct half reactions, a reductive half mechanism followed by an oxidative half. In the first half, NADPH reduces FAD present in GSR to produce a transient FADH  anion. This anion then quickly breaks a disulfide bond of Cys58 - Cys63, forming a short lived covalent bond a stable charge-transfer complex between the flavin and Cys63. The now oxidized NADP  is released and is subsequently replaced by a new molecule of NADPH. This is the end of the so-called reductive half of the mechanism. Oxidative half\nIn the oxidative half of the mechanism, Cys63 nucleophilically attacks the nearest sulfide unit in the GSSG molecule (promoted by His467), which creates a mixed disulfide bond (GS-Cys58) and a GS  anion.",

Next, Cys63 nucleophilically attacks the sulfide of Cys58, releasing a GS  anion, which, in turn, picks up a solvent proton and is released from the enzyme, thereby creating the second GSH. So, for every GSSG and NADPH, two reduced GSH molecules are gained, which can again act as antioxidants scavenging reactive oxygen species in the cell. Inhibition\nIn vitro, glutathione reductase is inhibited by low concentrations of sodium arsenite and methylated arsenate metabolites, but in vivo, significant Glutathione Reductase inhibition by sodium arsenate has only been at 10 mg kg day. Glutathione reductase is also inhibited by some flavanoids, a class of pigments produced by plants. Clinical significance\nGSH is a key cellular antioxidant and plays a major role in the phase 2 metabolic clearance of electrophilic xenobiotics. The importance of the GSH pathway and enzymes that affect this delicate balance is gaining an increased level of attention in recent years.

By designing drugs specific to p. falciparum it may be possible to selectively induce oxidative stress in the parasite, while not affecting the host. There are two main classes of GR targeting compounds:\nInhibitors of GSSG binding, or dimerization: Reactive electrophiles such as gold compounds, and fluoronaphthoquinones. Drugs which use glutathione reductase to regenerate, such as redox cyclers. Two examples of these types of compounds are Methylene blue and Naphthoquinone. Clinical trials performed in Burkina Faso have revealed mixed results when treating malaria with Naphthoquinones\nIn cells exposed to high levels of oxidative stress, like red blood cells, up to 10  of the glucose consumption may be directed to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) for production of the NADPH needed for this reaction.",

Lupus is an autoimmune disorder in which patients produce an elevated quantity of antibodies that attack DNA and other cell components. In a recent study, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the Glutathione Reductase gene was found to be highly associated with lupus in African Americans in the study. African Americans with lupus have also been shown to express less reduced glutathione in their T cells. The study's authors believe that reduced glutathione reductase activity may contribute to the increased production of reactive oxygen in African Americans with lupus. In mice, glutathione reductase has been implicated in the oxidative burst, a component of the immune response. The oxidative burst is a defense mechanism in which neutrophils produce and release reactive oxidative species in the vicinity of bacteria or fungi to destroy the foreign cells. Glutathione Reductase deficient neutrophils were shown to produce a more transient oxidative burst in response to bacteria than neutrophils that express GR at ordinary levels. The mechanism of Glutathione Reductase in sustaining the oxidative burst is still unknown. Deficiency\nGlutathione reductase deficiency is a rare disorder in which the glutathione reductase activity is absent from erythrocytes, leukocytes or both.",

In one study this disorder was observed in only two cases in 15,000 tests for glutathione reductase deficiency performed over the course of 30 years. In the same study, glutathione reductase deficiency was associated with cataracts and favism in one patient and their family, and with severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in another patient. It has been proposed that the glutathione redox system (of which glutathione reductase is a part) is almost exclusively responsible for the protecting of eye lens cells from hydrogen peroxide because these cells are deficient in catalase, an enzyme which catalyzes the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide, and the high rate of cataract incidence in glutathione reductase deficient individuals. Some patients exhibit deficient levels of glutathione activity as a result of not consuming enough riboflavin in their diets. Riboflavin is a precursor for FAD, whose reduced form donates two electron to the disulfide bond which is present in the oxidized form of glutathione reductase in order to begin the enzyme's catalytic cycle.",

In 1999, a study found that 17.8  of males and 22.4  of females examined in Saudi Arabia suffered from low glutathione reductase activity due to riboflavin deficiency. Connection to favism\nIn favism, patients lack glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, an enzyme in their pentose phosphate pathway that reduces NADP  to NADPH while catalyzing the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphoglucono-δ-lactone. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient individuals have less NADPH available for the reduction of oxidized glutathione via glutathione reductase. Thus their basal ratio of oxidized to reduced glutathione is significantly higher than that of patients who express glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, normally, making them unable to effectively respond to high levels of reactive oxygen species, which causes cell lysis.

The activity can be monitored by the NADPH consumption, with absorbance at 340 nm, or the formed GSH can be visualized by Ellman's reagent. Alternatively the activity can be measured using roGFP (redox-sensitive Green Fluorescent Protein). In plants\nAs it does in human cells, glutathione reductase helps to protect plant cells from reactive oxygen species. In plants, reduced glutathione participates in the glutathione-ascorbate cycle in which reduced glutathione reduces dehydroascorbate, a reactive byproduct of the reduction of hydrogen peroxide. In particular, glutathione reductase contributes to plants' response to abiotic stress. The enzyme's activity has been shown to be modulated in response to metals, metalloids, salinity, drought, UV radiation and heat induced stress. History\nGlutathione reductase was first purified in 1955 at Yale University by P. Janmeda. Janmeda also identified NADPH as the primary electron donor for the enzyme. Later groups confirmed the presence of FAD and the thiol group, and an initial mechanism was suggested for the mechanism in 1965.

Biography\nDenisov was born in Tomsk, Siberia. He studied mathematics before deciding to spend his life composing. This decision was enthusiastically supported by Dmitri Shostakovich, who gave him lessons in composition. In 1951 56 Denisov studied at the Moscow Conservatory: composition with Vissarion Shebalin, orchestration with Nikolai Rakov, analysis with Viktor Tsukkerman and piano with Vladimir Belov. In 1956 59 he composed the opera Ivan-Soldat (Soldier Ivan) in three acts based on Russian folk fairy tales. He began his own study of scores that were difficult to obtain in the USSR at that time, including music by composers ranging from Mahler and Debussy to Boulez and Stockhausen. He wrote a series of articles giving a detailed analysis of different aspects of contemporary compositional techniques and at same time actively experimented as a composer, trying to find his own way. After graduating from the Moscow Conservatory, he taught orchestration and later composition there.",

He supported and encouraged Dmitri Capyrin and Alexander Shchetynsky who have never been his pupils. See: List of music students by teacher: C to F Edison Denisov. In 1979, at the Sixth Congress of the Union of Soviet Composers, he was blacklisted as one of  Khrennikov's Seven  for unapproved participation in a number of festivals of Soviet music in the West. Denisov became a leader of the Association for Contemporary Music reestablished in Moscow in 1990. Later he moved to France, where after an accident and long illness he died in a Saint-Mandé hospital in 1996. Music\nDenisov's cycle for soprano and chamber ensemble Le soleil des Incas (1964), setting poems by Gabriela Mistral and dedicated to Pierre Boulez, brought him international recognition following a series of successful performances of the work in Darmstadt and Paris (1965).

Later he wrote a flute concerto for Aurèle Nicolet, a violin concerto for Gidon Kremer, works for the oboist Heinz Holliger, clarinettist Eduard Brunner and a sonata for alto saxophone and piano for Jean-Marie Londeix, that became highly popular among saxophone players. His sombre but striking Requiem, setting a multi-lingual text (English, French, German, and Latin) based on works by the Francisco Tanzer, was given its first performance in Hamburg in 1980.

    "text": "History\nFormation and The Temper Trap EP (2005 2007)\nThe Temper Trap formed as an indie pop band in 2005. Indonesian-born Mandagi, who is originally from Manado and a grand-nephew of Arie Frederik Lasut, was a busker in Melbourne, Australia, in 1999 when he met Aherne, who wanted to learn to play guitar. Six years later, Mandagi met Dundas while the pair worked in a clothing store. In 2005, the three friends decided to form a band, with Mandagi on vocals and guitars, and Dundas on drums, while Aherne was later convinced to join on bass guitar by Mandagi. The group was named  The Temper Trap  after Temper Temper, the trio's first choice, was rejected due to its use by a United States (US) band. The Temper Trap rehearsed with a variety of second guitarists before Dundas recommended his former Geelong Grammar schoolmate, Sillitto, on lead guitar. The group performed at St Jerome's Laneway Festival in March 2006. The group signed to Michael Gudinski's label, Liberation Music, and released its debut extended play (EP), The Temper Trap, in November 2006 through the label; the EP was produced by Scott Horscroft (The Sleepy Jackson, Silverchair).",

    "text": "According to a live review by  planetclare  of Australian music website FasterLouder, Dundas sometimes abandons the drums and plays guitar, while Mandagi's voice  hits a note and then transcends it, slicing the sound barrier and leaving you with your mouth open and your eyes wide . The review also described Aherne regularly moving around the stage and Sillitto providing guitar solos that  subtlety drove the melody from the side of stage . After finishing an Australian tour, the band then performed at the V Festival in Melbourne, Sydney (March 2007) and the Gold Coast (April). Conditions (2008 2011)\nIn late 2008, The Temper Trap started recording their debut album, Conditions, in Melbourne with engineering by record producer Kalju Tonuma. They travelled to the UK and attracted the attention of the local music industry after playing at the Musexpo in London in October. By January 2009, the band had signed to Infectious Records for European releases. The BBC chose The Temper Trap in its top 15 Sound of 2009 list. In March, the band finished recording Conditions in London with UK music producer Jim Abbiss. Mandagi said his key influences when recording it had included Radiohead, Prince, Massive Attack and U2. In May, after performing at South by Southwest in March, they signed to Glassnote Records for US releases.",

Prior to establishing the Xia, the imperial clan existed as a tribal entity known as the Tiefu (simplified Chinese: 铁弗; traditional Chinese: 鐵弗; pinyin: Tiěfú). All rulers of the Xia declared themselves  emperors . Both the Tiefu and Xia were based in the Ordos Desert, and during the reign of Helian Bobo, they constructed their capital of Tongwan, a heavily fortified and state-of-the-art city that served as a frontier garrison until the Song dynasty.

Qubei was a member of the ruling-Luandi clan as the uncle of the last Chanyu, Huchuquan, although a later and more dubious account alleged that he was the descendant of a Han dynasty prince-turned-Xiongnu noble, Liu Jinbo instead. In 196, he assisted the warlord, Cao Cao in escorting Emperor Xian of Han to Xuchang, and in 216, Cao Cao appointed him to supervise the Five Divisions of the Southern Xiongnu in Shanxi.",

The word  Tiefu  referred to people with Xiongnu fathers and Xianbei mothers, indicating that the tribe had intermingled with the Xianbei. The Tiefu were also known as Wuhuan, which in the 4th century was another term for  miscellaneous hu  or  zahu . In 310, Liu Hu rebelled against the Western Jin dynasty in Shanxi. The Tuoba-Xianbei tribe allied with the Jin and quelled his rebellion, and were rewarded with their fiefdom of Dai. Liu Hu fled west to Shuofang Commandery, where the Han-Zhao emperor, Liu Cong, gave him the title of Duke of Loufan. The Tiefu resided in Shuofang for many years. Liu Hu waged war with Dai but was repeatedly defeated and at one point had to flee the Great Wall. His son, Liu Wuhuan succeeded him in 341 and immediately entered a marriage alliance with Dai.

Weichen alternated between supporting the Dai and the Di-led Former Qin. In 376, after multiple defeats to Dai, he convinced Qin to launch a campaign against them, with him acting as a guide. Qin conquered Dai that same year, but when dividing up their territory, Weichen was unhappy that Qin deferred more control to his cousin, Liu Kuren of the Dugu tribe, prompting him to rebel. He was defeated and forced to cross the Yellow River west of the Ordos, where he resubmitted to Qin. As the Former Qin collapsed following the Battle of Fei River, Weichen re-occupied Shuofang in 386. Around the same time, the Tuoba had also revived their state, now known as the Northern Wei.

In 402, Moyigan and Liu Bobo fled to the Qiang-led Later Qin under pressure from Wei. During his time in Qin, Bobo caught the attention of its ruler, Yao Xing. Impressed by his appearance and talents, Yao Xing made Bobo a general and assigned him to defend Shuofang, despite warnings from his officials regarding his violent behaviour.

Despite his grudge against the Northern Wei, Bobo mainly concentrated his military efforts on the Later Qin. He refused to establish a capital in his early reign, instead choosing to lead a roving army and attacking Qin s northern borders when least expected. In 413, Bobo, believing that it was inappropriate to claim lineage of the Han dynasty through his maternal line, changed his family name from Liu to the prestigious-sounding name of Helian. He also built his capital city of Tongwancheng at the southern edge of the Mu Us Desert. Construction of the city was reportedly brutal, with around 100,000 Han Chinese and tribal people being drafted to build the city. Remains of the city can still be seen today at Jingbian County, Shaanxi. In 414, Helian Bobo entered into an alliance with the Northern Yan in Liaoning, and in 415, with the Northern Liang in Gansu. The war with Xia greatly drained the Qin economy and military, with many of their key generals being killed in battle.

Due to its isolation from the political turmoil of the capital, Port-au-Prince, it is one of Haiti's major ports, with export trade concentrating on mostly coffee and sugarcane. As the world's largest supplier of vetiver, it exports 250 tons annually of this ingredient of perfume and fragrance manufacturing. Minor exports include bananas and timber. History\nEuropean settlement\nThe island of what was known by the Spanish as Hispaniola was inhabited for thousands of years by indigenous peoples. The first European settlement in the southwest area was the town of Salvatierra de la Sabana, founded by the Spanish explorer Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar in 1504. Vasco Núñez de Balboa was a co-founder of this town and lived there for several years trying to raise pigs as a business. Balboa gave up that enterprise and left the town hiding in a barrel of a Spanish expedition going to explore the Gulf of Uraba, Panama. Vasco Núñez de Balboa, later on 25 September 1513 would discover the South Sea, today known as the Pacific Ocean.",

The area was uninhabited until the French colonial administration founded the town of Aux Cayes ( On the cayes ), so named due to its proximity to Île-à-Vache. The town was destroyed twice by hurricanes in 1781 and 1788. In July 1793, the whites in Les Cayes were massacred. Asylum for independent insurgencies\nSimón Bolívar arrived in Les Cayes on 24 December 1815, and on 2 January 1816 was introduced to Alexandre Pétion, President of the Republic of Haiti by a mutual friend seeking assistance for his insurgency against the Spanish colonial government in Venezuela. Bolívar and Pétion impressed and befriended each other and, after Bolívar pledged to free every slave in the areas he occupied, Pétion gave him money and military supplies. Mexican nationalists, Francisco Javier Mina and José Joaquín de Herrera took asylum in Les Cayes and were welcomed by Pétion during the Mexican War of Independence.

American pilots were investigated for their actions, though none were condemned. These actions were described by anthropologist Jean-Philippe Belleau as possibly  the first ever carried out by air on civilian populations . President Herbert Hoover had become increasingly pressured about the effects of occupying Haiti at the time and began inquiring about a withdrawal strategy. By 1929, Haitians had grown angered with the Borno-Russell government and American occupation, with demands for direct elections increasing. In early December 1929, protests against the American occupation began at the Service Technique de l Agriculture et de l Enseignement Professionnel's main school. On December 6, 1929, about 1,500 Haitians peacefully protesting local economic conditions in Les Cayes were fired upon by U.S. Marines, with the massacre resulting in 12 to 22 Haitians dead and 51 injured. The massacre resulted in international outrage, with President Hoover calling on Congress to investigate conditions in Haiti the following day. Natural disasters\nIn the wake of the 12 January 2010 earthquake, the Cuban military set up a field hospital in the region.

Tourism\nLes Cayes plays a significant role in the still under-developed Haitian tourism industry, with pleasant sights such as:\nGelée Beach: one of the longest and most visited beaches in Haiti. The white sand beach of Gelée beach is very popular in Haiti, not only for its restaurants which serve typical southern Haiti dishes such as tonm-tonm, grilled-conch, grilled-fish and lobster, but also for hosting an annual music festival around mid-August which usually features some of the best Compas music bands. Many visitors both from within Haiti and neighboring USA will come spend the weekend in Les Cayes. As the number of tourists continues to grow, several new hotels and restaurants continue to pop up.

For a long period, the upper floors were occupied by the BBC's Engineering Designs Department, with the ground floor being occupied firstly by a car showroom and latterly being used for the BBC's Recorded Sound Effects Library. During this period, the building became the UK base for the first transatlantic colour television satellite communications.

Side effects may include abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, and feeling tired. While normal doses are deemed safe in pregnancy and breastfeeding, the safety of larger doses is unclear. Greater care should be taken in those with kidney problems. Zinc is an essential mineral in people as well as other animals. The medical use of zinc sulfate began as early as the 1600s.

Misuse\nDuring the 1918 flu pandemic in New Zealand, inhalation chambers were set up in towns and cities as a means to boost immunity. The public were encouraged to attend these chambers and inhale a zinc sulfate mist, a process that was said to disinfect the lungs and throat and protect against infection. In reality, the inhalation of hot steam could inflame the nasal tissue, potentially making participants more susceptible to infection. In towns such as Ashburton, New Zealand for example, in order to be eligible to travel by train, people had to present documentation at the train station proving that they had been through the inhalation chamber. The inhalation chamber which was set up in the old Dunedin Post Office building was described as follows:  It was a small room, relatively airtight, holding 20 or 30 persons, and the air is impregnated with the vapour of zinc sulphate. Each batch remains in the chamber for 10 minutes, and the persons treated are instructed to breathe through the nose at first, and then through the mouth. References\nExternal links\n Zinc Sulfate .

Description\nGambelia copeii is between 8 and 14 cm (3.1 and 5.5 in) in snout-to-vent length (SVL), and has a smoky gray color and darker gray or black dorsal spots, edged in a lighter shade. The dorsal pattern appears mottled or ocellated. There are light crossbars on the dorsum, and light gray or white on the venter. It has small granular scales. The large head is distinct from the neck, and the lining of the mouth and throat is purplish-black. Juvenile lizards are similar to adults, but have more distinct banding across the dorsum. Females develop red-orange blotches on the ventral side during breeding season. Males have femoral pores. Biology\nThe Baja California leopard lizard is an uncommon species. It is a powerful bipedal runner. An adult can inflict a painful bite. It prefers chaparral habitats with an open understory.",

    "text": "The Battle of Beaver Dam Creek, also known as the Battle of Mechanicsville or Ellerson's Mill, took place on June 26, 1862, in Hanover County, Virginia. It was the first major engagement of the Seven Days Battles during the Peninsula Campaign of the American Civil War and the start of Confederate General Robert E. Lee's counter-offensive against the Union Army of the Potomac, under Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, which threatened the Confederate capital of Richmond. Lee attempted to turn the Union right flank, north of the Chickahominy River, with troops under Maj. Gen. Thomas J. Stonewall  Jackson, but Jackson failed to arrive on time. Instead, Maj. Gen. A.P. Hill threw his division, reinforced by one of Maj. Gen. D.H. Hill's brigades, into a series of futile assaults against Brig. Gen. Fitz John Porter's V Corps, which occupied defensive works behind Beaver Dam Creek. Confederate attacks were driven back with heavy casualties. Porter withdrew his corps safely to Gaines Mill, with the exception of Company F ( The Hopewell Rifles ) of the 8th Pennsylvania Reserve Regiment who did not receive the orders to retreat.",

Background and Lee's plan\nMilitary situation\nAfter the Battle of Seven Pines, on May 31 and June 1, McClellan and the Army of the Potomac sat passively at the outskirts of Richmond for almost a month. Lee, newly appointed commander of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, devoted this period to reorganizing his army and preparing a counter-attack. He also sent for reinforcements. Stonewall Jackson arrived on June 25 from the Shenandoah Valley following his successful Valley Campaign. He brought four divisions: his own, now commanded by Brig. Gen. Charles S. Winder, and those of Maj. Gen. Richard S. Ewell, Brig. Gen. William H. C. Whiting, and Maj. Gen. D.H. Hill. The Union Army straddled the rain-swollen Chickahominy River. Four of the Army's five corps were arrayed in a semicircular line south of the river. The V Corps under Brig. Gen. Porter was north of the river near Mechanicsville in an L-shaped line running north south behind Beaver Dam Creek and southeast along the Chickahominy.",

Lee moved most of his army north of the Chickahominy to attack the Union north flank. He left only two divisions (under Maj. Gens. Benjamin Huger and John B. Magruder) to face the Union main body. This concentrated about 65,000 troops against 30,000, leaving only 25,000 to protect Richmond against the other 60,000 men of the Union army. It was a risky plan that required careful execution, but Lee knew that he could not win in a battle of attrition or siege against the Union army. The Confederate cavalry under Brig. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart had reconnoitered Porter's right flank as part of a daring circumnavigation of the entire Union army from June 12 to June 15 and found it vulnerable. Stuart's forces burned a couple of Union supply ships and was able to report much of McClellan's army's strength and position to Gen. Lee. McClellan was aware of Jackson's arrival and presence at Ashland Station, but did nothing to reinforce Porter's vulnerable corps north of the river.

The Union artillery and musketry tore enormous gaps in the Confederate lines as they attempted to cross the creek. Although A.P. Hill had 24 guns with him, he made no attempt to use massed artillery fire to counter the Union gunners, instead sending individual batteries in support of the infantry, most of which were quickly put out of action by enemy shelling. Some of Anderson's men managed to get across the creek and momentarily threaten Reynolds's position, however he was reinforced by Meade's brigade and two regiments from Morell's division.

Jackson did not attack, but his presence near Porter's flank caused McClellan to order Porter to withdraw after dark behind Boatswain's Swamp, five miles (8 km) to the east. McClellan was concerned that the Confederate buildup on his right flank threatened his supply line, the Richmond and York River Railroad north of the Chickahominy, and he decided to shift his base of supply to the James River (he also believed that the demonstrations by Huger and Magruder showed that he was seriously outnumbered). This was a strategic decision of grave import because it meant that, without the railroad to supply his army, he had to abandon his siege of Richmond. Aftermath\nOverall, the battle was a Union victory  by any definition , in which the Confederates suffered heavy casualties and achieved none of their specific objectives due to the seriously flawed execution of Lee's plan. Instead of over 60,000 men crushing the enemy's flank, only five brigades, about 15,000 men, had seen action. Their losses were 1,484 versus Porter's 361.

Despite the Union tactical success, however, it was the start of a strategic debacle and the unraveling of the Peninsula Campaign.

    "text": "The Laughing Place is a traditional African American folktale, featuring Br'er Rabbit, Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear. It is famous for its inclusion among Joel Chandler Harris' Uncle Remus stories. Summary\nFollowing Br'er Rabbit's capture, the hero leads his captors, wily Br'er Fox and dim-witted Br'er Bear, to his  laughin' place . Out of curiosity, they let him lead the way, only for Br'er Rabbit to walk them straight into a cavern of bees. While the antagonists are stung, Br'er Rabbit escapes. This story can be traced to African trickster tales, particularly the hare that figures prominently in the storytelling traditions in Western Africa, Central Africa, and Southern Africa. In the Akan traditions of West Africa, the trickster is usually the spider (see Anansi), though the plots of tales of the spider are often identical with those of stories of Br'er Rabbit. In popular culture\nThe story was used in the 1946 film Song of the South along with  The Tar Baby  and  The Briar Patch . It is also referenced in a dark ride scene of Splash Mountain, a log flume-style attraction based on Song of the South at Tokyo Disneyland and formerly at Disneyland and Magic Kingdom. The term  The Laughing Place  is also used in the Stephen King novel Misery and the second season of the series Castle Rock. References",

It generally runs from west to east through five counties, beginning at the Pennsylvania state line in the Delaware River near Narrowsburg, crossing the Hudson River on the Newburgh Beacon Bridge, and ending in Carmel. NY 52 and NY 55, both major east west routes of the Mid-Hudson Region, run parallel to each other, intersecting in downtown Liberty. With the exception of the section overlapping Interstate 84 (I-84), most of Route 52 is a two-lane road through lightly developed rural areas. The road west of the Hudson River serves a number of small communities in the southern Catskills and Hudson Valley, such as the villages of Jeffersonville, Ellenville and Walden. East of the Hudson, it closely parallels I-84 after leaving it at the village of Fishkill. It once passed through the cities of Newburgh and Beacon, following a ferry between them, but since the bridge's construction Route 52 runs concurrently with I-84 just to their north. Much of what is today Route 52 was built as private turnpikes in the early 19th century. After their operating companies folded later in the century, the state took over the roads in the 1890s.",

After their operating companies folded later in the century, the state took over the roads in the 1890s. While some portions of today's Route 52 were included in New York's first designations of state highways, it was not until a 1930 renumbering that Route 52 took that number. At that time it followed most of its present alignment, but continued east of its present terminus to NY 22. The truncation to its junction with US 6 in Carmel came later in the 1930s, along with an exchange of alignments between routes 52 and 216. When the Newburgh-Beacon Bridge was opened in the early 1960s, Route 52 was rerouted onto I-84, bypassing a route to the ferry landings in Newburgh and Beacon. The alignment to I-84 in the latter city is today Route 52 Business. Route description\nSullivan County\nA little over half of NY 52's total mileage is in Sullivan County, due to its circuitous route in the less developed western half of the county, where some segments are maintained by the county rather than the state.

Then NY 216 forks off to the northeast, leading to Green Haven Correctional Facility and the hamlet of Stormville. For the next half-mile (800 m) NY 52 passes through a more wooded area, then turns southeastward again. After another half-mile, the route turns due south and begins to climb steeply into the wooded foothills of the Taconic Mountains through a narrow creek valley. I-84 crosses overhead, on a very high overpass. A half-mile further on from that, the Appalachian Trail (AT) crosses the route. The route turns again a quarter-mile (400 m) from the AT to follow a more easterly course. The terrain levels out into a minimally developed area of small bumps and wetlands.",

History\nSimilar to many state highways in the region, NY 52 follows a number of roads originally built as private turnpikes during the early 19th century. While the turnpikes made significant improvements to very poor roads, they were not popular with the public and eventually failed, leaving their roads for the county or state to maintain. Predecessor turnpikes\nOne of these, the Woodbourne and Ellenville Turnpike Company, connected those two communities. After being incorporated by the New York Legislature in 1830, it built and opened a turnpike from Ellenville on the Delaware and Hudson Canal west to Woodbourne in 1838, and later extended it further in that direction to Liberty. To the east of Ellenville, the Newburgh and Ellenville Plank Road Company was proposed in late 1849 to build and charge tolls on a plank road between Ellenville and Newburgh, major markets on the canal and Hudson respectively, and incorporated the following year.",

Both roads were completed in December 1851; an opening celebration for the Newburgh and Ellenville was held at Ellenville that month. The south route is now, with some modifications, part of NY 52. In 1895 the Walden and Orange Lake Railroad, later part of the Orange County Traction Company, built a trolley line along the old turnpike between Orange Lake, then the end of a suburban line from Newburgh, and Walden. It carried passengers and freight, including milk, until its demise in 1925. Other former turnpikes used by NY 52 include short lengths of the Jeffersonville and Monticello Turnpike (Jeffersonville to Briscoe Road), Ulster and Orange Branch Turnpike (Liberty to Cross Farm Road), Philipstown Turnpike (Pecksville to Ludingtonville), and Putnam and Dutchess Turnpike (Ludingtonville to the end in Carmel). By the 1890s, the entire route that would become NY 52 existed as public or turnpike roads. Public ownership\nAfter the demise of the turnpikes, the State Commission of Highways was created by the legislature in 1898 to improve and maintain state highways.",

Natural disasters and construction have forced temporary closures and re-routings in some areas. At the end of 2002, a rockslide along the stretch climbing the Shawangunks east of Ellenville buried an 85-foot (25 m) section of the road with an estimated 1,000 cubic yards (800 m3) of rock and dirt. The state Department of Transportation closed the road temporarily. Automobile traffic was detoured via several local roads; trucks had to make a lengthy side trip via Route 17 During the 2003 2005 construction of the new bridge over the Wallkill River in Walden, NY 52 was routed to Walden's other bridge (the  Low Bridge ) via Oak Street, which intersects the highway twice within the village.",

Truck traffic was detoured to NY 17K via Albany Post Road and Stone Castle Road. Future\nThe village of Walden has noted, in its 2019 Comprehensive Plan, the difficulties created by the oblique intersection at the eastern end of the Route 208 concurrency. Traffic on northbound 208 comes to a stop sign at the intersection, where 52 comes in from the right at a slightly lower grade and a sharp angle, with the view mostly blocked by a building. It is also just opposite one of two curb cuts for a busy gas station. At rush hour, the traffic light at the nearby northern end often backs cars up along 52 for some distance, making the turn into the gas station difficult, especially when vehicles on 52 make the left turn into the curb cut. Some are often stranded in the middle of the intersection when turning between the two highways. A 2009 traffic study found the intersection at level of service D, during peak hours with the potential to reach  F  within five years. The layout of the intersection is very poor for trucks making this turn; they have caused damage to the curb. The congestion that all these factors create has been forcing more drivers to resort to the use of side streets, the village believes, since traffic counts have been going up on 52 and 208 but down on the concurrency.",

On 16 November 1937, Georg Donatus, Cecilie, their two young sons, Georg's mother Grand Duchess Eleonore, the children's nurse, a family friend, a pilot, and two crewmen, took off in a Sabena Junkers Ju 52 aeroplane from Darmstadt, bound for the United Kingdom, where the marriage ceremony of Prince Louis would take place. The aeroplane hit a factory chimney near Ostend, in Belgium, and crashed, bursting into flames and killing everyone on board. Cecilie was in an advanced state of pregnancy with their fourth child at the time of the crash. The remains of the newborn baby were found in the wreckage, indicating that Cecilie had gone into labour during the flight. The inquiry by the Belgian authorities into the crash suggested that, because of the birth, the pilot was attempting to land at the Stene aerodrome in Ostend despite poor weather conditions. Aftermath\nPrince Louis's wedding had been scheduled for the 20th but, following discussions with his future father-in-law Lord Geddes, was brought forward to the day following the accident (17 November), as a small and quiet ceremony with the guests dressed in mourning.",

    "text": "Ganymede Abducted by the Eagle (c. 1531 1532) is a painting by the Italian late Renaissance artist Antonio da Correggio. It is housed in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna, Austria. The work was part of a series executed by Correggio for Federico II Gonzaga in Mantua, about the loves of Jupiter. The painting depicts Ganymede. History\nThe series of Jupiter's Loves was conceived after the success of Venus and Cupid with a Satyr. Correggio painted four canvasses in total, although others had been programmed perhaps. In the first edition of his Lives, late Renaissance art biographer Giorgio Vasari mentions only two of the paintings, Leda (today at the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin) and one Venus (presumably the Danae currently in the Borghese Gallery of Rome), although he knew them only from descriptions provided by Giulio Romano. Vasari mentions that the commissioner, Duke Federico II Gonzaga, wanted to donate the works to emperor and King of Spain Charles V: the fact that the other two works, the Ganymede and Jupiter and Io, were in Spain during the 16th century implies that they were part of the same series.",

In 1603 1604 the painting was acquired by the emperor Rudolf II together with Parmigianino's Cupid Making His Arch, and sent to Prague.

    "text": "Enantiophanes was a Byzantine jurist whose exact identity is uncertain. The period when the jurist lived who bears this name has also been a subject of much dispute among scholars. Identity\nJohn Thomas Graves, writing in 1870, states the following:\nCujacius, in his Preface to the 60th book of the Basilica, prefixed to the 7th volume of Fabrot's edition of that work, supposes Enantiophanes to be the assumed name of a Graeco-Roman jurist, who wrote peri enantiophanôn, or concerning the explanation of apparent legal inconsistencies. Suarez (Notit. Basil. 35) says that Photius, in his Nomocanon, mentions having written such a work. Fabricius, in a note upon the work of Suarez (which is inserted in the Bibliotheca Graeca,) states that Balsamo, in his Preface to the Nomocanon of Photius, refers to Enantiophanes. Assemanni, however, shows (Bibl. Jur. Orient. ii. 18, p. 389) that there is no reason for attributing a work peri enantiophanôn to Photius, that there is no passage in his Nomocanon relating to such a work, and that the sentence in which Balsamo is supposed by Fabricius to refer to Enantiophanes has no such meaning.",

Period\nAs to Enantiophanes's lifetime, Graves relates what follows:\nReiz (ad Theophilum, pp. 1234, 1236) thinks that Enantiophanes wrote before the composition of the Basilica, and marks his name with an asterisk as an ascertained contemporary of Justinian. In Basil. iii. p. 318 Enantiophanes calls Stephanus his master; but this is by no means conclusive. Assemanni, misled by Papadopoli, thinks that the Stephanus here meant lived under Alexius Comnenus, and was not the Stephanus who was one of the compilers of Justinian's Digest. The contemporary of Justinian, however, was undoubtedly the person intended; but Stephanus was one of those early Graeco-Roman jurists who, like Domninus, Patricius, and Cyrillus, are thought by Zachariae (Anecdota, p. viii.) to have been called by subsequent jurists masters or teachers in a general sense.

According to the Scholium on the Basilica (ii. p. 548, ed. Heimbach), he seems to have written notes upon the Digest. That he was alive after the death of Justinian appears from Basil. iii. p. 230 (ed. Heimbach), where he cites a Novell of Justin.

On the other hand, Assemanni thinks that he wrote after the composition of the Basilica, which, in the Scholium, Basil. i. p. 262, he appears to cite; but it is very likely that here, as in many other places, that which was originally a citation from the Digest has been subsequently changed for convenience into a reference to the Basilica. In Basil. iii. p. 440, he cites Gregorius Doxapater, whom Pohl (followed by Zachariae), on the supposed authority of Montfaucon, places in the first half of the 12th century; but we have shown that there is no ground for identifying Gregorius Doxapater with the Doxapater mentioned by Montfaucon. An eminent jurist of the time of Justinian is frequently cited in the Basilica, and in the Scholia on that work by the appellation of the Anonymous. This writer composed an Index or abridgment of the Novells of Justinian, and was the author of Paratitla (a comparison of parallel passages) in the Digest.

Biener (Geschichte der Novellen Justinians, p. 56) threw out the conjecture, that the Anonymous was no other than Julianus, the author of the Latin Epitome of the Novells; and Zachariae (Anecdota, p. 204 7) attempts to establish this conjecture.

    "text": "A passphrase is a sequence of words or other text used to control access to a computer system, program or data. It is similar to a password in usage, but a passphrase is generally longer for added security. Passphrases are often used to control both access to, and the operation of, cryptographic programs and systems, especially those that derive an encryption key from a passphrase. The origin of the term is by analogy with password. The modern concept of passphrases is believed to have been invented by Sigmund N. Porter in 1982. Security\nSource:\nConsidering that the entropy of written English is less than 1.1 bits per character, passphrases can be relatively weak. NIST has estimated that the 23-character passphrase  IamtheCapitanofthePina4  contains a 45-bit strength. The equation employed here is:\n4 bits (1st character)   14 bits (characters 2 8)   18 bits (characters 9 20)   3 bits (characters 21 23)   6 bits (bonus for upper case, lower case, and alphanumeric)   45 bits\n(This calculation does not take into account that this is a well-known quote from the operetta H.M.S.

An MD5 hash of this passphrase can be cracked in 4 seconds using crackstation.net, indicating that the phrase is found in password cracking databases.)\nUsing this guideline, to achieve the 80-bit strength recommended for high security (non-military) by NIST, a passphrase would need to be 58 characters long, assuming a composition that includes uppercase and alphanumeric. There is room for debate regarding the applicability of this equation, depending on the number of bits of entropy assigned. For example, the characters in five-letter words each contain 2.3 bits of entropy, which would mean only a 35-character passphrase is necessary to achieve 80 bit strength. If the words or components of a passphrase may be found in a language dictionary especially one available as electronic input to a software program the passphrase is rendered more vulnerable to dictionary attack. This is a particular issue if the entire phrase can be found in a book of quotations or phrase compilations. However, the required effort (in time and cost) can be made impracticably high if there are enough words in the passphrase and if they are randomly chosen and ordered in the passphrase. The number of combinations which would have to be tested under sufficient conditions make a dictionary attack so difficult as to be infeasible. These are difficult conditions to meet, and selecting at least one word that cannot be found in any dictionary significantly increases passphrase strength.",

If passphrases are chosen by humans, they are usually biased by the frequency of particular words in natural language. In the case of four word phrases, actual entropy rarely exceeds 30 bits. On the other hand, user-selected passwords tend to be much weaker than that, and encouraging users to use even 2-word passphrases may be able to raise entropy from below 10 bits to over 20 bits. For example, the widely used cryptography standard OpenPGP requires that a user make up a passphrase that must be entered whenever decrypting or signing messages. Internet services like Hushmail provide free encrypted e-mail or file sharing services, but the security present depends almost entirely on the quality of the chosen passphrase.

Passphrases are theoretically stronger, and so should make a better choice in these cases. First, they usually are and always should be much longer 20 to 30 characters or more is typical making some kinds of brute force attacks entirely impractical. Second, if well chosen, they will not be found in any phrase or quote dictionary, so such dictionary attacks will be almost impossible. Third, they can be structured to be more easily memorable than passwords without being written down, reducing the risk of hardcopy theft.

In 2012, two Cambridge University researchers analyzed passphrases from the Amazon PayPhrase system and found that a significant percentage are easy to guess due to common cultural references such as movie names and sports teams, losing much of the potential of using long passwords. When used in cryptography, commonly the passphrase protects a long machine generated key, and the key protects the data. The key is so long a brute force attack directly on the data is impossible. A key derivation function is used, involving many thousands of iterations (salted   hashed), to slow down password cracking attacks. Passphrases selection\nTypical advice about choosing a passphrase includes suggestions that it should be:\nLong enough to be hard to guess\nNot a famous quotation from literature, holy books, et cetera\nHard to guess by intuition even by someone who knows the user well\nEasy to remember and type accurately\nFor better security, any easily memorable encoding at the user's own level can be applied.

While such a collection of words might appear to violate the  not from any dictionary  rule, the security is based entirely on the large number of possible ways to choose from the list of words and not from any secrecy about the words themselves. For example, if there are 7776 words in the list and six words are chosen randomly, then there are 7,7766   221,073,919,720,733,357,899,776 combinations, providing about 78 bits of entropy. (The number 7776 was chosen to allow words to be selected by throwing five dice. 7776   65) Random word sequences may then be memorized using techniques such as the memory palace. Another is to choose two phrases, turn one into an acronym, and include it in the second, making the final passphrase. For instance, using two English language typing exercises, we have the following. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog, becomes tqbfjotld.

There are several points to note here, all relating to why this example passphrase is not a good one. It has appeared in public and so should be avoided by everyone. It is long (which is a considerable virtue in theory) and requires a good typist as typing errors are much more likely for extended phrases. Individuals and organizations serious about cracking computer security have compiled lists of passwords derived in this manner from the most common quotations, song lyrics, and so on. The PGP Passphrase FAQ suggests a procedure that attempts a better balance between theoretical security and practicality than this example. All procedures for picking a passphrase involve a tradeoff between security and ease of use; security should be at least  adequate  while not  too seriously  annoying users. Both criteria should be evaluated to match particular situations. Another supplementary approach to frustrating brute-force attacks is to derive the key from the passphrase using a deliberately slow hash function, such as PBKDF2 as described in RFC 2898.

Saliya Vapieva of the National Liberation Movement (NOD) wrote:  Delyagin is an enemy of the people, because he calls for voting against amendments to the Constitution, which should lead to the restoration of Russia's sovereignty. Denies the existence of the coronavirus pandemic, emphasizing that the epidemic threshold has been exceeded worldwide in only 1 country (San Marino). He is an opponent of compulsory vaccination. In April 2022, Delyagin and a group of associates introduced Bill No. 113045-8 on the Control of the Activities of Persons under Foreign Influence, according to which a  foreign agent  is a Russian citizen who does not receive foreign funding, but who  is under foreign influence in other forms. The bill was criticized because it  expands the space for arbitrariness. ; even the head of the Constitutional Committee of the Federation Council, Andrei Klishas, spoke out against  frequent changes to the law. . In June 2022, Delyagin and a group of associates introduced Bill   140449-8, sharply restricting the holding of rallies, marches, demonstrations and assemblies.",

Since the authors proposed to include  religious premises, buildings and structures, as well as land plots on which such buildings and structures are located  in the list of places near which it is prohibited to hold meetings, marches, rallies and demonstrations, the Russian Orthodox Church expressed concern about this bill: the amendments contradict the law  On Freedom of Conscience and Religion. about religious associations . In addition, Delyagin's bill prohibits holding public actions near train stations and stations, as well as near buildings of public authorities. Responses to criticism Mikhail Delyagin in 2012 commented on the accusations of  political omnivorousness  and  love for liberals. :My job, my place in life, is to express the positive synthesis of values that has developed in Russian society. Our society is one, and it's stupid to divide it into apartments   leftists here, patriots there, Democrats here. Near-political schizophrenics are easy to divide, but normal people don't.: they carry all the values. As for the love of liberals, I never speak out against democratic principles, but only against the perversion of these principles by liberal fundamentalists.",

In March 2022, Delyagin, responding to the activity of the Azerbaijani military in the temporary deployment zone of the Russian peacekeeping corps in Nagorno-Karabakh, said on the air of the 60 Minutes program on the Russia 24 channel:  The Azerbaijanis really violated the ceasefire. And ours said that they retreated after we talked to them. And they officially stated that they did not leave the occupied territories. So this policy of aggression on the part of the American satellites and in this case Turkey, on the part of the Turkish proxies, which we call a state. This is a real danger today. And if we do not punish for this harshly and unequivocally, then why do we need the oil industry of Azerbaijan, a simple question? We do not need it, and it is extremely vulnerable.

Shortly before this, Delyagin conducted a poll on his Telegram channel about whether it is acceptable to  use tactical nuclear weapons to eliminate the oil industry of Azerbaijan  after reposting an article by political scientist Dimitriev, who considered this possibility. Delyagin was criticized for these words by the press secretary of the Russian president Dmitry Peskov, the official representative of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova, deputy chairperson of the State Duma commission on parliamentary ethics Nikolai Arefyev, as well as Delyagin's ally in the party, secretary of the presidium Oleg Shein. The leader of the party  A Just Russia - For Truth  Sergei Mironov said that Delyagin's words about Azerbaijan do not reflect the party's position.

The Federal National-Cultural Autonomy of Azerbaijanis in Russia called on the Prosecutor General's Office of Russia to initiate a criminal case against Delyagin under Article 354 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (public calls to unleash an aggressive war), stating, in particular, that  such statements and actions cannot in any way be called adequate, and the person who voiced and wrote this can even less be called mentally balanced. Delyagin later apologized to  everyone who was frightened or offended, or insulted  by his words, noting that he hoped  that some part of the Azerbaijani bureaucracy will behave reasonably  and reported that,  as far as I can judge from the existing reaction, the call for respect for Russian peacekeepers and their difficult work was heard by its addressees.

    "text": "When You Read This Letter (French: Quand tu liras cette lettre) is a 1953 French-Italian drama film directed by Jean-Pierre Melville and starring Philippe Lemaire, Juliette Gréco and Yvonne Sanson. It was shot at the Billancourt Studios in Paris. Location filming also take place on the coast of Southern France where the film is set. The film's sets were designed by the art director Robert Gys. The film was a commercial success and permitted Melville to acquire his own studios to make his future productions. Synopsis\nAfter their parents die in a road accident, a strongly moral young woman named Thérèse Voise leaves a convent shortly before taking her vows in order to care for her younger sister Denise and run the family stationery shop with her. Thérèse is very protective of Denise and becomes concerned when her sister strikes up an acquaintance with Max, a young amateur boxer and garage mechanic. Max is a self-centered, amoral drifter who is conducting numerous different relationships with girls at nightclubs. He is also pursuing Irène Faugeret, a wealthy married woman, managing to get employment as her chauffeur and become her lover. Max strikes up a friendship of sorts with Biquet, a bellhop at the Hôtel Carlton who acts as Max's eyes and ears, especially as concerns Madame Faugeret.",

Denise is attracted to Max, but after a chance meeting at the hotel he sexually assaults her. A distraught Denise attempts to drown herself, and is only narrowly saved from suicide. After she has recovered, Thérèse blackmails Max into getting engaged to Denise by threatening to reveal the circumstances to the police who are already investigating Max for the death in an automobile accident of Irène, his wealthy lover. Max was responsible for Irène Faugeret's death as he had loosened three screws on her car's steering column. Max did not expect her to use the car the night of the fatal accident. He expected Biquet would use it instead, part of their scheme to steal Irène's money and then flee to Tangiers to start a new life. Max was hoping to double-cross Biquet. Instead, he caused Irène Faugeret's death. Denise is delighted and optimistic about the future. However, Thérèse remains contemptuous of her future brother-in-law. Max tries to persuade Thérèse that he has fallen in love with her and attempts to seduce her. She rejects his advances, but it remains unclear to what extent she is attracted to him.",

    "text": "250 Douglas Place is a high-rise apartment building in Wichita, Kansas. It is located in the Garvey Center development. It is the second-tallest building in both Wichita and the state of Kansas. In 2021, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History\nThe Holiday Inn Plaza hotel opened in July 1970, as part of the Garvey Center, which also contained two 10-story office towers. The hotel was the tallest building in Wichita until the Epic Center was built in 1987. Even today, it remains the building with the most floors in the state. On August 11, 1976, Michael Soles, an unemployed welder from Sand Springs, Oklahoma, set up a sniper position on the hotel. Over the course of an eleven-minute shooting spree, he killed three and wounded six others. The gunman was eventually wounded by the police and taken into custody. The hotel made an appearance in the 1976 film King Kung Fu (a low-budget knock-off of King Kong). The hotel left Holiday Inn in 1987 and became the Century II Plaza Hotel. Beginning in 1997, it was gradually converted to an apartment building, with each apartment made by combining two old hotel rooms. The conversion was fully completed in 2015 and the tower was renamed 250 Douglas Place. See also\nList of tallest buildings in Wichita\nList of tallest buildings by U.S.",

Wrestlers will portray villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that build tension and culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches. Storylines are produced on Impact's weekly television program. At Hard To Kill, Masha Slamovich defeated Deonna Purrazzo, Killer Kelly, and Taylor Wilde in a four-way match to become number one contender to the Impact Knockouts World Championship.

Reception\nWriting for Allmusic, critic Mark Deming wrote of the album  The craft is strong on Standard Songs for Average People, but at its heart it sounds like two friends singing some old songs they love on a quiet evening, and that's part of the album's strength -- these are 14 songs sung by two guys who know a great tune when they hear it, and they allow these numbers to work their magic simply, which serves them very well. Music critic Don Grant wrote  This release by veterans Prine and Wiseman doesn't break any new ground... As would be expected from two performers of this caliber, the tunes are well executed and come off with nary a hitch. If you're a new listener to this game, by all means pick it up and expand your horizons. However, for most, it's probably a shade on the redundant side.

    "text": "VBScript (Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition) is a deprecated programming language for scripting on Microsoft Windows using Component Object Model (COM), based on classic Visual Basic and Active Scripting. It was popular with system administrators for managing computers and automating many aspects of computing environments, and has been installed by default in every desktop release of Microsoft Windows since Windows 98; in Windows Server since Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack; and optionally with Windows CE (depending on the device it is installed on). VBScript running environments include: Windows Script Host (WSH), Internet Explorer (IE), and Internet Information Services (IIS). The running environment is embeddable in other programs via the Microsoft Script Control (msscript.ocx). In October 2023, Microsoft announced that VBScript was deprecated. In May 2024, a multi-phase deprecation schedule was announced with disabling it by default  around 2027  and removing it sometime later. History\nVBScript began as part of the Microsoft Windows Script Technologies, launched in 1996. This technology (which also included JScript) was initially targeted at web developers. During a period of just over two years, VBScript advanced from version 1.0 to 2.0, and over that time it gained support from Windows system administrators seeking an automation tool more powerful than the batch language first developed in the early 1980s.",

    "text": "On August 1, 1996, Internet Explorer was released with features that included VBScript. In version 5.0, the functionality of VBScript was increased with new features including regular expressions; classes; the With statement; the Eval, Execute, and ExecuteGlobal functions to evaluate and execute script commands built during the execution of another script; a function-pointer system via GetRef, and Distributed COM (DCOM) support. In version 5.5, SubMatches were added to the regular expression class in VBScript, to finally allow script authors to capture the text within the expression's groups. That capability had already been available in JScript. With the advent of the .NET Framework, the scripting team decided to implement future support for VBScript within ASP.NET for web development, and therefore no new versions of the VBScript engine would be developed. It would henceforth be supported by Microsoft's Sustaining Engineering Team, who are responsible for bug fixes and security enhancements. After announcing plans to remove support for VBScript, Microsoft suggested migrating to Windows PowerShell or JavaScript. Environments\nClient-side web\nIn a web page loaded by Internet Explorer, VBScript is similar in function to JavaScript. The VBScript code in the HTML is logic that interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM) of the page   allowing for functionality not possible in HTML alone. However, other web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox and Opera do not support VBScript.",

However, other web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox and Opera do not support VBScript. Therefore, when client-side scripting and cross-browser compatibility are required, developers usually choose JavaScript due to its wide cross-browser compatibility. Active server page\nVBScript is used for server-side web page functionality via Active Server Pages (ASP). The ASP engine, asp.dll, invokes vbscript.dll to run VBScript scripts. VBScript that is embedded in an ASP page is contained within    and    context switches. The following example displays the current time in 24-hour format. Windows script host\nVBScript can run directly in the operating system via the Windows Script Host (WSH). A script file, usually with extension .vbs can be run either via Wscript.exe for graphical user interface (GUI) or Cscript.exe for command line interface (CLI). Windows script file\nA Windows Script File (WSF), styled after XML, can include multiple VBS files and is therefore a library of VBScript code that can be reused in a modular way. The files have extension .wsf and can be executed using wscript.exe or cscript.exe, as with a .vbs file. HTML Application\nAn HTML Application (HTA) is styled after HTML.",

Windows Script Component\nVBScript can also be used in a Windows Script Component, an ActiveX-enabled script class that can be invoked by other COM-enabled applications. These files have extension .wsc. Functionality\nLanguage features\nThe VBScript language is modeled on classic Visual Basic. Notable features include:\nA  procedure  is the main construct in VBScript for separating code into smaller modules. VBScript distinguishes between a function, which can return a result in an assignment statement, and a subroutine, which cannot. Parameters are positional, and can be passed by value or by reference. Control structures include the usual iterative and conditional Do Loops, If-Then-Else statements, and Case statements, with some more complex variants, such as ElseIf and nested control structures.",

As a memory aid in coding, and certainly for readability, there are a large number of constants, such as True and False for logical values, vbOKCancel and vbYesNo for MsgBox codes, vbBlack and vbYellow for color values, vbCR for the carriage return character, and many others. Variables have  Variant  type by default, but it is possible (and sometimes necessary) to force a particular type (integer, date, etc.) using conversion functions (CInt, CDate, etc.)\nUser interaction is provided through the functions MsgBox and InputBox which provide a simple dialogue box format for messages and input. Both functions display prompting messages, with the former returning a standard response, and the latter returning one user-supplied text or numeric value. For more elaborate GUI interaction with controls, VBScript can be used in combination with HTML, for example, in an HTML Application. Event-driven forms are not supported as in Visual Basic or Visual Basic for Applications. Names are not case-sensitive. However, it is considered a best practice of VBScript style to be consistent and to capitalize judiciously.

For debugging purposes the Microsoft Script Debugger can still be used in current Windows versions, even though the tool has not been updated in years. It allows the user to set break points in the VBScript code but the user interface is more than clumsy. There are VBScript debuggers available from third-party sources, and many text editors offer syntax highlighting for the language. During execution, when an error occurs, the script host issues a message stating the type of error and the number of the offending line. Uses\nAlthough VBScript is a general-purpose scripting language, several particular areas of use are noteworthy. First, it used to be widely used among system administrators in the Microsoft environment, but it has since been vastly surpassed by PowerShell. Second, VBScript is the scripting language for OpenText UFT One, a test automation tool. A third area to note is the adoption of VBScript as the internal scripting language for some embedded applications, such as industrial operator interfaces and human machine interfaces.

VBScript omits several useful features of the full Visual Basic, such as strong typing, extended error trapping and the ability to pass a variable number of parameters to a subroutine. However, its use is relatively widespread because it is easy to learn and because those who implement code in the language need not pay royalties to Microsoft as long as the VBScript trade mark is acknowledged. When an organization licenses Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) from Microsoft, as companies such as Autodesk, StatSoft, Great Plains Accounting and Visio (subsequently acquired by Microsoft) have done, it is allowed to redistribute the full VBA code-writing and debugging environment with its product. VBScript is used in place of VBA as the macro language of Outlook 97. VBScript can be effectively used for automating day to day office tasks as well as monitoring in the Windows-based environment. It can also be used in collaboration with ADODB ActiveX Data Objects (ADODB) for effective database connectivity.

    "text": "Fruitville is a census-designated place (CDP) in Sarasota County, Florida, United States. The population was 15,484 at the 2020 census, up from 13,224 at the 2010 census. It is part of the North Port Bradenton Sarasota, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. History\nAn 1857 map of the  Country in the Vicinity of Manatee  during the Third Seminole War shows settlers near what is now Fruitville. The area had a large sawgrass swamp that was bounded on the east by Tatum Ridge (named for the George Tatum Sr., 1822 1910), north and west by Phillippi Creek with its headwaters in the Meadows residential development through Circus Hammock and Bobby Jones municipal golf course and Bee Ridge to the south. This marshland was home to wild Florida Cracker cattle. In 1923, the Sarasota-Fruitville drainage district was established (see also Bertha Palmer family). The new district provided around 8,000 acres of land for cultivation near the community of Fruitville. The farm land was formed by draining the historic wetland and dredging a drainage canal to Phillippi Creek, which drained roughly 26,000 acres. This area was later reclaimed as a wetland, and became the Celery Fields Regional Stormwater Facility. After the Civil War, a new wave of pioneers began to settle in Florida thanks to a growing citrus industry.",

After the Civil War, a new wave of pioneers began to settle in Florida thanks to a growing citrus industry. In 1876, Charles Reaves (1847 1931) settled in what is now considered Fruitville. According to some sources, he was the one who named the area Fruitville after the abundance of fruit in the area. In 1895, Reaves would go on to become the postmaster for the area's 115 residents. The first church in what is now Sarasota County was the Friendship Baptist Church established by Reverend John Wright Hendry (1836 1907). The church was chartered in 1875 and a small pine log structure was used for the congregation until a new church was erected in 1876, using some of the original lumber from the first church. From 1877 to 1891, Isaac Alderman Redd (1835 1912) was pastor of the Friendship Baptist Church which first met in the Bee Ridge community. In 1887, the Florida Mortgage and Investment Company of Scotland donated land in Fruitville to the church for the establishment of the community's first cemetery.",

Also in 1887, Charles and his wife Martha Tatum Reaves (daughter of George Tatum Sr.,1853-1935) converted their corncrib into Fruitville's first school for their three children and seven neighbors. They went on to hire Miss Josie Clower as the first teacher in the area. After citizens petitioned for a modern school building, funding was granted from the Works Progress Administration to build Fruitville Elementary in 1941. Rural schools in the nearby villages of Tatum Ridge and Old Miakka were closed, with their students bussed to the new school in Fruitville. A map from 1902 shows Fruitville on the map as a community. In May 1918, Franklin Field (named after then-mayor George Franklin) began operating as a military airfield during World War I. The Franklin airfield was located north of Fruitville Road and east of what is now Tuttle road. The airfield was an auxiliary landing station for the U.S. Army Air Service and housed, at the least, several Curtiss JN  Jenny  planes. With the war over, the airfield saw less and less traffic and was likely unused by 1920. In 1924 the land was developed for a new subdivision.",

The first municipal airport in Sarasota county was located in Fruitville. It was dedicated in 1929, located on a 160-acre site near the intersection of 12th Street and Beneva Road (then named Oriente Avenue). The airport was renamed Lowe Field after Johnny Lowe purchased the land during World War II. After the war, most civilian air traffic moved to the Sarasota-Bradenton Airport. Lowe Field closed in 1961 and the land was sold. Throughout the 1960s and 70s, there was a migrant camp called Sababo in Fruitville that supplied much of the labor force for area's farm industry. A major crop in the area was celery. In 1966, there was an estimated 2,000 migrant workers in Sarasota County. To provide healthcare and education to this population, on December 5, 1966, the Fruitville Area Medical and Educational (FAME) Center was opened. In November 1990, Litchfield's Cinema 10 opened in the Sarasota Commons, the community's first modern movie theater. As a promotion, the theater offered tickets for only 50 cents during its opening.

General Hospital (1954 1955), and chief resident at Freedmen s (1956 1957). Leffall then became one of the first Black fellows in surgical oncology at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, where he trained from 1957 to 1959 under the mentorship of Dr. Jack E. White.

He was stationed at Ft. Sam Houston in Texas before being assigned as chief of general surgery at the U.S. Army Hospital in Munich, Germany. He completed two years of active duty and was later honorably discharged with the rank of Major. During his Army service, Leffall encountered racial segregation despite holding an officer s commission. He recalled that, while stationed at Ft. Sam Houston in Texas, he and three White colleagues went to a local movie theater. Although his White colleagues were allowed to enter, Leffall was denied admission solely because of his race. In a show of solidarity, his colleagues chose to leave with him. Leffall later described the incident as one of the most painful experiences of his life, underscoring the irony of facing racial discrimination at home while preparing to serve his country abroad.

The price of courage\nIn a 1979 interview with The Washington Post, Dr. LaSalle Leffall reflected on the emotional cost of taking principled stands, referencing the controversy surrounding Muhammad Ali s refusal to be drafted during the Vietnam War based on religious and racial beliefs. Leffall, who had by then built a respected medical career, acknowledged the challenge of maintaining high standards while breaking new ground as a Black physician. He emphasized that being among the first came with pressure to excel, as he felt he could not afford to fall short or set a poor example for those who would follow. Mentorship played a consistent role in Leffall s career. Dr. Wendy Greene, who trained at Howard University, recalled his reflections on what he called the  Grace Notes  of life small but meaningful gestures that could enhance doctor patient relationships. She noted that he emphasized the importance of listening not only to patients  words, but also to the concerns behind them.

    "text": "The Ciné-Kodak was the first movie camera for 16 mm, manufactured by the Eastman Kodak Company and introduced in 1923. It was intended for home movie making. Kodak released additional models, including magazine-loading cameras as the Magazine Ciné-Kodak line and a line of 8 mm cameras under the Ciné-Kodak Eight sub-brand. The final 16 mm camera was the Kodak Reflex Special, released in 1961, dropping the Ciné-Kodak brand altogether; Kodak ceased production of 16 mm cameras in 1968, but continued to produce 8 mm and Super 8 film cameras under the Ektasound and Instamatic brands. History and models\nKodak introduced 16 mm film in June 1923 alongside the first Ciné-Kodak, a movie camera that was both more portable and affordable than those using 35 mm film; the new camera and film type were more suited for amateur use and generally are credited as the enabling technology for the creation of the first home movies. Lettered models\nThe initial prototype was a leather covered rectangular wooden box, which evolved into a cast aluminum box when the camera was released, approximately 8 8.5 4.5 in (200 220 110 mm) (H L W). The first Ciné-Kodak was cranked by hand at two turns per second to achieve the necessary 16 frames per second.",

The camera was equipped with a fixed 1-inch (25mm) lens. Early in 1924 a battery-powered electric motor attachment was introduced, but this accessory was discontinued in 1926, at which time an improved version of the camera with an interchangeable Kodak Anastigmat f 1.9 lens was introduced. The lens focal range was 2 to 50 feet and INF (infinity). The only additional lens offered was a 78mm f 4.5 telephoto. With the discontinuation of the motor, additional crank accessories were introduced: one for single frames, and one with a 4:1 gear ratio for slow motion work. In 1925, Kodak followed with a spring motor-driven Ciné-Kodak Model B, at which time the original Ciné-Kodak was re-designated as Model A, though that designation was not added to the camera nameplate until November 1929. A full winding of the spring would run the Model B motor for about fifteen to twenty feet of film.",

The Model B was available with fixed-focus f 6.5 and f 3.5 lenses, along with a version with a focusing f 1.9 lens; these cameras were intended for the amateur, while the Model A was retained as suitable for the advanced amateur. Special Editions of the Model B were released with ostrich leather covering the camera body and carrying case. In 1927, the Kodak list prices for Ciné-Kodak ranged from US 225 (equivalent to  4,070 in 2024) for the Model A with f 1.9 lens and tripod to US 75 (equivalent to  1,360 in 2024) for the Model B with f 6.5 lens. Production of Model A ceased in 1930; the Model B in 1931. In 1929, a Model BB for 50-foot reels and an additional 8 frames second speed was introduced, followed by the Model K in 1930, which was an enlarged BB for 100-ft reels. As furnished with a f 3.5 Anastigmat lens, in 1934 the Model K was listed at US 112.50 (equivalent to  2,640 in 2024).",

The Model K was joined briefly by a stripped-down Model M, but the latter camera did not sell well since it lacked some of the very features that made the Model K appealing. In 1937, the Model E was introduced with a shape similar to the later Pathé Webo camera and provided slow motion speeds and an internal viewfinder instead of the open frame types used hitherto. End of production\nThe final 16 mm spool loading camera, the Ciné-Kodak Model K-100, arrived in 1955 in both three-lens turret and non-turret versions, using the Bell   Howell-developed C mount for interchangeable lenses. In 1961, Kodak dropped the Ciné-Kodak branding, releasing the Kodak Reflex Special to compete with the Arriflex 16ST, featuring continuous reflex viewing; this last 16 mm camera manufactured by Kodak did not sell well and was discontinued in 1968. The 16 mm Ciné-Kodaks were well-made, long-lived cameras. Most have double claws and double sprockets and hence require double perf (2R) film in unmodified form.",

The exceptions are both the Specials and K100 models that were designed for single perf (1R) film, which allowed for the addition of sound tracks. Professional cameras\nIn 1933, the Ciné-Kodak Special was introduced for advanced amateur and semi-professional work, and quickly became popular with professionals for its vast range of capabilities. A new universal Kodak S-mount was introduced with this camera, although the Special required an adapter to use S-mount lenses. The Ciné-Kodak Special II was introduced in 1948 with a diverging turret to allow for mounting a longer second lens without interfering with the field of view of the shorter focal length, but was otherwise unchanged from the Special. The Special II was discontinued in 1961. Magazine cameras\nKodak released the first of a line of magazine-loading cameras sold under the Magazine Ciné-Kodak sub-brand in 1936, made initially in Kodak's Nagel Works in Germany.

The next major development was the introduction of magazine loading, with the Magazine Ciné-Kodak Eight, Model 90, introduced in 1940, sharing the same lens mount with the 16 mm Magazine Ciné-Kodak; the Model 90 was replaced by the Ciné-Kodak Magazine 8 in 1946, which had only minor cosmetic upgrades from the Model 90. The Magazine 8 was discontinued in 1948. During the 1950s, Kodak continued to produce simple double-run 8 mm movie cameras with fixed lenses under the venerable Brownie name.

    "text": "Marshall's Mill is a former flax spinning mill on Marshall Street in Holbeck, Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. Marshall's Mill was part of a complex begun in 1791 92 by English industrial pioneer John Marshall. It was originally a four-storey mill, drawing water from the nearby Hol Beck. A Boulton   Watt steam engine was installed to assist water power. Rapid expansion followed with the addition of Mill 'B' (1794) adjacent to a warehouse built to service the original mill (all now demolished.)\nIt was to eventually supplant Yorkshire's previous cottage industry of hand driven spindles. As the business continued to expand further mills, warehouses, engine houses, and reservoirs were added on the south side of Hol Beck. The six storey Mill 'C' was added in 1815 16, Mill 'D' followed in 1826 27, and Mill 'E' (which is aligned to the roadside and joined Mill 'C' to Mill 'D') in 1829 31. Temple Mill, in the form of an Egyptian Temple, was built between 1838 and 1841. Later, the complex employed over 2,000 factory workers. When it was completed it was considered to be one of the largest factories in the world, with 7,000 steam-powered spindles. The addition of the Temple Mill completed development of mills by Marshall   Sons on this site.",

In 1832 Marshall's political opponents alleged that:\n'In Mr Marshall's mill, a boy of 9 years of age was stripped to the skin, bound to an iron pillar, and mercilessly beaten with straps, until he fainted.'\nBut other reports claim that Marshall treated his workers better than most factory owners: overseers were forbidden to use corporal punishment to control the workers, and Marshall installed fans and attempted to regulate the temperature of the mill. In 1844, Marshall and a neighbouring engineering firm, Taylor, Wordsworth and Co broke new ground by organising an away weekend in Liverpool for their workers, a novelty which caused even the editor of the normally liberal Leeds Mercury some concern:\n'Entirely approving of excursions for the working class, and with the kindest feelings towards the workmen of Messrs Marshall and Messrs Taylor and Wordsworth, we would express our earnest hope that the Sunday spent in Liverpool may not in any respect be spent in a manner unbecoming the day ...",

Additionally, the possibility of turning On Call into a media franchise, with at least one spin-off series, was included in these discussions as well. If a new platform for the show is found, Amazon would allowe producers to regain control of the first season's streaming rights.

The website's consensus reads:  On Call is an undemanding patrol thanks to its half-hour format, but the shorter runtime is about the only new novelty it brings to the cop drama genre. Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 48 out of 100, based on 8 critics, indicating  mixed or average  reviews. The series received primarily mixed reviews.

Writing a review for Comic Book Resources, Brittany Frederick opined that the program established itself by avoiding the overused elements typical for the genre and that the shorter runtime allowed it to avoid filler scenes. Jonathan Wilson from Ready Steady Cut described the series as  a new kind of cop drama, blending serialized drama with a procedural, and while not all of it works, the result is mostly lean, mean entertainment. Isabella Soares with Collider praised the chemistry between Belisario and Larraccuente's characters, writing that it  sets the tone for the show's more humane approach to the procedural. But Why Though critic Kate Sánchez penned a more mixed review and said the program  lacks catharsis but attempts complexity . She explained that the focus on patrol officers rather than detectives allows the audience to see more danger, but criticized the copaganda and portrayal of gangs. Sánchez concluded her review by adding that it  doesn't reinvent the genre but it does thrive in it , believing that a longer episode count would work better for the series. Looper's Ryder Alistair condemned On Call's format, saying that it was  awkwardly divided  between its overarching story and case of the week, stating  the continuing storyline ensures it can't be enjoyed as an episodic cop show like its broadcast counterparts, and is too generic and reliant on cliché to hold interest by itself.",

    "text": "Wycliffe Well is an abandoned UFO tourist attraction consisting of a former roadhouse, petrol station, caravan park and restaurant on the Stuart Highway, 375 kilometres (233 mi) north of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory, Australia. Gaining interest in the site from the late 1980s onwards by UFO enthusiasts after a newspaper article, it went through two owners as a UFO tourist attraction, proclaiming itself as the  UFO capital of Australia,  before being bought by United Petroleum. It was then abandoned following a major flood in 2022. History\nWycliffe Well initially took its name from a water well built in 1875. The area was purchased in 1985 by former Royal Australian Navy sailor Lew Farkas as a small roadhouse store. Facing little competition for hundreds of kilometres, according to Farkas, the site grew to become a caravan park. The previous owners of the site contacted him about alleged UFO sightings, though Farkas stated this previous owner kept the sightings secret so as not to scare off prospective buyers. In the late 1980s, a story in the Tennant Times newspaper about potential sightings at Wycliffe Well caused international interest in the site to grow, and Farkas shifted the marketing of his business to entirely revolve around aliens. He has stated that he spent about  4 million over 25 years to do so, also building a 300-seat Galaxy Auditorium restaurant and a nearby lake.",

Attractions included murals and souvenirs, a book ledger of so-called UFO sightings and night tours. After some time, the roadhouse began to call itself  the UFO capital of Australia. A potential buyer of the premises was reported in 2008. In 2009 or 2010, Farkas sold the business to Anthony Vanderzalm, also known as Arc, who continued to collect alien paraphernalia for the premises including a prop alien corpse from the set of a Hollywood movie. Vanderzalm later sold it to United Petroleum. The company was largely interested in selling fuel at the station, and the UFO aspect of the location became less important. A Vice article in 2017 described the site as  broken, faded, unloved. The Daily Telegraph reported in March 2019 that it had  one of the best beer selections in the Northern Territory. By August 2019, three Indian-Australian entrepreneurs, Nikhilesh Jalla, Surya Mandarapu and Vamsi Koneru, were managing the property. In September 2021, an investigation into the site was made by the Liquor Commission after police found at least 30 people intoxicated and around 12  engaged in fist-fights  that August.",

The rebellion seemed clearly driven by Sunpadh's close connection to Abu Muslim, as he was one of his companions and supporters. He threatened in marching to Mecca and destroy the Kaaba. The rebellion ended up being suppressed by the Arab commander Jahwar ibn Marar al-Ijli. Approximately 30,000 to 60,000 of Sunpadh's followers killed with Sunpadh killed by Jahwar al-Ijli or murdered by the relative of the Dabuyid ruler, Ispahbad Khurshid. Background and rebellion\nThe news of Abu Muslim al-Khurasani's execution led to disturbances to the people of Khurasan and the broader Persian population, from northeastern to western Iran many mourned his death, believing they had lost their savior and the most significant figure to emerge from their ranks since the Islamic conquest of Persia. In early 755, with an aim to avenge the murder, Sunpadh, a nobleman from the village of Ahan or Ahrawanah in the district of Nishapur of Khorasan.

Sunpadh was first in Abu Muslim's army, which he had brought with him when he wanted to perform Hajj in the year 136 AH (753 CE or 754 CE). Abu Muslim had left a part of his army in Ray, along with some of his treasuries. Sunpadh maybe was in the army that encamped in Ray, or maybe Sunpadh remained residing in Nishapur. Religion of Sunpadh\nHistorians differed in their description of the faith of Sunpadh. al-Masudi considered him a Khurramite, while al-Tabari said that he was a Zoroastrian, while Nizam al-Mulk described him as a Mazdakite. According to the modern historian Farouk Omar:  However, if we look closely at the slogans raised by Sunpadh, we notice his attempt to reconcile the principles of Ghali Islam, Khurramism, and Mazdakism. This indicates that Sunpadh spread his propaganda among Islamic and non-Islamic elements, and in order to include them in his movement, he raised different slogans that suited all these groups. For this reason, his slogans were political and religious at the same time.",

In his opinion, there was no difference between the teachings of the Ghulat and the teachings of Mazdak. Nizam al-Mulk says that Sunpadh's teachings greatly influenced the Rafida (perhaps he meant the Ghulat Shiites) and the Followers of Mazdak. Sunpadh was identified as a Zoroastrian by the most of modern historians. Beginning of the rebellion\nThe rebellion erupted under Sunpadh's leadership, in Nishapur, driven by his personal allegiance to Abu Muslim, whose assassination served as the catalyst that triggered the rebellion. where Sunpadh propagated messianic beliefs concerning Abu Muslim's fate, asserting that his mentor's death was not final: Abu Muslim would return from the dead, accompanied by the Mahdi of the Rafidites and Mazdak, to guide us  Sunpadh's followers  to ultimate triumph. Another motivation for Sunpadh's rebellion was his pursuit of restoring of the ancient Persian religion (Zoroastrianism) while simultaneously pursuing the expulsion of Arab forces from the Persian territories. His radical anti-Islamic agenda culminated in his bold declaration to destroy the Kaaba itself.",

The movement gained vital assistance from the Dabuyid ruler, who was known as the ispahbadh of Tabaristan, Khurshid (r. 740 760), as Sunpadh sent a part of Abu Muslim's treasuries to him to support the anti-Abbasid rebellion. Ispahbadh Khurshid whose the domain remained minimally affected by Islamic influence and whose assistance proved essential for the rebellion's early momentum. Rural populations throughout Ray and its vicinity rallied to Sunpadh's movement. The movement attracted supporters from diverse regions including Tabaristan, Daylam, and Jibal. the rebels mostly composed of Khurramites, with rebel forces reportedly reaching between 90,000 and 100,000 participants. However, Historian Farouk Omar suggests these numerical estimates may have been exaggerated. Sunpadh's followers were mostly farmers and peasants. Sunpadh managed to capture the cities of Nishapur, Ray. Sunpadh defeated and killed the governor of Qumis, Abu 'Ubaid al-Hanafi, and captured the city. He earned the title of  Firuz Ispahbadh  ( the victorious Ispahbadh ).

After he successfully captured Ray, he planned to invade Iraq, he took a large number of Muslims captive, especially women, but he treated the merchants and the owners of the goods kindly, perhaps because he hoped that they would prepare provisions and food for his large number of soldiers. Suppression of rebellion\nAbbasid Response\nAs Sunpadh and his followers were moving toward Hamadan, the Abbasid caliph, al-Mansur, responded by dispatching a substantial military force under the command of Jahwar ibn Marrar al-Ijli. The expedition comprised approximately 10,000 troops, including Khorasani forces from Iraq, Arab contingents from western Iran, and additional units from Fars, Khuzistan, Isfahan, and Qom.

Before the decisive engagement, Jahwar addressed his troops to motivate them for the impending battle, framing the conflict in religious and material terms:You will be fighting people bent on eliminating your religion and expelling you from your world of wealth and power. The decisive confrontation occurred between Hamadhan and Ray at the desert's edge, a battle at Jurjunban. Despite initial resistance, Sunpadh's forces suffered a catastrophic defeat, with approximately 30,000 to 60,000 of his followers reportedly killed during the rout. The aftermath saw the capture of women and children among Sunpadh's supporters as prisoners of war. Following his military defeat, Sunpadh and his brother attempted to seek sanctuary in Tabaristan. The entire rebellion, from its inception to Sunpadh's death, lasted merely seventy days.

The precise circumstances vary among medieval historians: some sources claim Lunan al-Tabari killed Sunpadh in the territory between Tabaristan and Qumis, while according to Nizam al-Mulk, Sunpadh was killed by Jahwar at Ray, and according to Ibn al-Athir, it was the Ispahbad's own agent who carried out the killing.

Life\nTiger was born around 1920 (though the exact year is not known). He was born in the bush, at a rockhole called Piltati, which is close to what is now Nyapaṟi in north-west South Australia. His family were Pitjantjatjara, and they lived a traditional, nomadic life in the bushland around Piltati. When he was a teenager, Tiger's family settled at Ernabella, which at the time was a Presbyterian mission and a sheep station. Tiger grew up on the mission, and learned to speak a little English in school there. He eventually married Nyalapanytja, and they lived in Ernabella for many years. Tiger worked on the station, shearing sheep and building fences. In the 1970s, Tiger and his family moved to Amaṯa, closer to his homeland. When he aged, Tiger became a ngangkaṟi (traditional healer), an important and respected role in traditional Pitjantjatjara communities. In 1997, the women at Amaṯa began a community art centre, originally called Minymaku Arts.",

After several men began painting in the early 2000s, the centre's name was changed to Tjala Arts. Tiger started painting in September 2004, less than eight years before his death. He had never painted before this, and was better known for woodworking, especially making spears. Although he only began painting in his final years, his work quickly became recognised by critics. In 2005, Tiger was a finalist for the National Aboriginal   Torres Strait Islander Art Award. He became a finalist three more time before his death, in 2006, 2010, and 2011, but he never won.

    "text": "The Oxyurini are a tribe of the duck subfamily of birds, the Anatinae. It has been subject of considerable debate about its validity and circumscription. Some taxonomic authorities place the group in its own subfamily, the Oxyurinae. Most of its members have long, stiff tail feathers which are erected when the bird is at rest, and relatively large, swollen bills. Though their relationships are still enigmatic, they appear to be closer to swans and true geese than to the typical ducks. The highest diversity is found in the warmer parts of the Americas, but at least one species occurs in a major part of the world. Their habitus resembles a freshwater diving duck, particularly when moving on dry land. Their legs are set far back, making them awkward walkers, so they rarely leave the water. When at rest, their tails are a notable difference, and in the water they often swim very deep-set. Their unusual courtship displays involve drumming noises from inflatable throat sacs, head throwing, and erecting short crests. Most display singly with a very elaborate and peculiar display, but musk ducks congregate at leks and have a more limited display. Systematics\nOne mid-sized genus and two or three which are monotypic are described today:\nThe black-headed duck of Heteronetta is indisputably quite basal, looking more like a typical duck-like Anatidae with a short tail and normal bill.",

The musk ducks (Biziura), sometimes included in this group, are noted for their bizarre habitus and pronounced sexual dimorphism; they are of uncertain position and decidedly aberrant. Their anatomy is more similar to Oxyura than to the two less derived genera, but still unique in many respects. mtDNA cytochrome b sequence data suggest a closer relationship with the pink-eared ducks (Malacorhynchus) which if correct would represent one of the most drastic cases of divergent adaptation in the whole Anseriformes. Altogether, however, the only thing that seems clear is that the musk ducks probably are not part of the stiff-tailed ducks in the strict sense, but rather represent a not-too-distantly related lineage that is highly convergent as regards their hind limb anatomy. These two are probably part of a very ancient radiation of Gondwanan (often Australian) waterfowl, including such forms as the Cape Barren goose (Cereopsis), the coscoroba swan (Coscoroba), the freckled duck (Stictonetta) which once was placed in the Oxyurinae, or the pygmy geese (Nettapus), but the exact relationships between these lineages remains unresolved.",

Three enigmatic genera of waterfowl, Mionetta from the Late Oligocene to Middle Miocene of central Europe and Dunstanetta and Manuherikia from the Bathans Early Middle Miocene of Otago, New Zealand, show some similarities to oxyurine ducks and judging from biogeography, the latter two may plausibly be related.

He added that Tyrone's involvement with Kirsty would not be a  smooth ride . Development\nDomestic violence storyline\nKirsty's character was seen to be manipulative and controlling, and a pregnancy storyline was written for the character with Kirsty and Tyrone discovering in January 2012 after splitting up with each other. After the character's controlling behaviour was seen on-screen, it was confirmed in March 2012 that Kirsty and Tyrone would become the centre of a domestic violence storyline; with The Sun reporting that Kirsty would  begin psychologically abusing Tyrone, culminating in many vicious, violent attacks . Upon hearing of the abuse storyline, Gumede and co-star Alan Halsall researched male domestic abuse charities such as ManKind - that support male victims of domestic violence, in order to portray the storyline as realistically as possible. She later told the Daily Record that  there isn't much from the female abuser's point of view to read up on, it was really a case of thinking about it from the victim's point of view. She later said that she found it hard and  draining  to film scenes where she attacked co-star Halsall, and that although  it was all camera tricks, the place I had to emotionally go to was quite ugly.",

After attacking Tyrone a second time, Kirsty attempts to leave him fearing that she is a danger to him. In an interview with Digital Spy, Gumede explained that Kirsty's violence stemmed from her childhood. She revealed that  Kirsty had an abusive childhood. Her father hit her on a regular basis up until her 18th birthday, when she left home. The inference is that she's had very little contact with her family since then. In June 2012, Gumede revealed that she was  terrified  at the prospect of filming scenes in which her character gave birth. She explained that  artificial baby bump makes filming difficult, especially in the warm sunshine  and that the upcoming scenes would provide a  further challenge in her career. Gumede told the Anna Mansell from the Lancashire Telegraph that  it has been really interesting how people have said they felt sorry for her  and that  viewers are intrigued to see what happens next as it s a really complex story for a complex character. Kirsty gave birth to a daughter, who she and Tyrone named Ruby. After bringing Ruby home, Kirsty struggles to cope with being a mother and when the baby does not stop crying, she trashes the kitchen.",

Tina, determined to get her out of Tyrone's life, gets Tommy to follow her and when they see her meeting a man, they assume that Kirsty is cheating on Tyrone but are disappointed when Kirsty tells Tyrone that she was meeting her cousin about a present for him and is so disgusted by the accusation of infidelity that she then leaves.",

    "text": "New Energy for America was a plan led by President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden beginning in 2008 to invest in renewable energy sources, reduce reliance on foreign oil, address global warming issues, and create jobs for Americans. The main objective of the New Energy for America plan was to implement clean energy sources in the United States to switch from nonrenewable resources to renewable resources. The plan led by the Obama Administration aimed to implement short-term solutions to provide immediate relief from pain at the pump, and mid- to- long-term solutions to provide a New Energy for America plan. The goals of the clean energy plan hoped to: invest in renewable technologies that will boost domestic manufacturing and increase homegrown energy, invest in training for workers of clean technologies, strengthen the middle class, and help the economy. History\nThe term  New Energy for America  was first used on July 28, 2004, at an event in downtown Boston that gathered leaders from labor, government, business, and the environmental community to discuss how the  new energy  economy is critical for the future. This event raised awareness for the need for renewable energy and suggested that the new energy economy is about jobs, national security, public health, and the planet left behind for future generations. The plan was presented by Barack Obama's presidential campaign in 2008. President Barack Obama, in his inaugural address called for the expanded use of renewable energy to meet the twin challenges of energy security and climate change.",

President Barack Obama, in his inaugural address called for the expanded use of renewable energy to meet the twin challenges of energy security and climate change. In 2009, the Obama Administration made an effort to allow homeowners to finance solar and energy improvements without cost upfront, also known as PACE (Property-Assessed Clean Energy); They collaborated with the Middle Class Task Force to create a Policy Framework for PACE Financing Programs. Obama issued a pair of memoranda on January 26, 2009, to publish higher fuel economy standards for the model year 2011 cars and light trucks by the end of March and lower greenhouse gas emissions (to revisit a California waiver request that would allow that state to implement its own greenhouse gas emission rules for vehicles). In June 2014, the Clean Power Plan was proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to the Obama Administration. The plan hoped to fight global warming and was approved by President Obama on August 3, 2015. On July 19, 2016, the Obama Administration announced a partnership between the Clean Energy Savings For All Initiative and the Departments of Energy (DOE), Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Agriculture (USDA), Health and Human Services (HHS), Veteran's Affairs (V.A.), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).",

Content\nThe plan aimed to:\nHelp create five million new jobs by investing  150 billion over the next ten years to encourage private efforts to develop clean energy sources and technology. Save more oil than the United States currently imports from the Middle East and Venezuela combined within 10 years. Put 1 million plug-in hybrid cars on the road by 2015, with emphasis on cars built in the United States. Generate 10 percent of the United States' electricity through renewable sources (renewable electricity) by 2012 and 25 percent by 2025. Implement a cap-and-trade program to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent by 2050. Short-term solutions\nThe New Energy for America plan offered three short-term solutions. These solutions were meant to help Americans through the immediate crisis when energy prices were high. The first solution would be to provide emergency energy rebates. This would be achieved by requiring oil companies to take a share of their profits and provide relief worth  500 per individual and  1000 per couple to help families cope with the rising gas and electricity prices. The second solution would be to enact legislation to prevent oil companies from unfairly raising prices. The third solution would be to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.",

Lamzdeliai are used to play improvised herding melodies raliavimai, ridovimai, and tirliavimai. Herders calmed their animals with these melodies, or they imitated the sounds of nature and birds. Other tunes played on the pipes were sutartines, songs, and contemporary dances (polka, waltz, mazurka, quadrille, and march). Traditional lamzdeliai are made of either bark or wood. The bark pipe (zieves lamzdelis) is made in the springtime of a willow, aspen or pine sprout. The bark is beaten on all sides, and twisted off of the wood. The blowing end is closed off with a stopper made from the wood, with one side cut off. At the place where the stopper ends, a whistle hole is cut into the bark, and one end of the hole is bent slightly inwards. Three to six finger holes are cut in the pipe. Wooden pipes are made of ash or linden wood. The bark is removed, and the instrument is hollowed out by burning, drilling or carving.

It is found in Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, and as a vagrant to Brazil and Peru. Taxonomy and systematics\nHudson's black tyrant was formally described by Philip Sclater in 1872 as Cnipolegus hudsoni. Sclater gave it the specific epithet hudsoni to honor Argentine-British ornithologist William Henry Hudson, who collected the first four specimens. The genus' spelling was later changed to Knipolegus. For a time the species was moved to genus Phaeotriccus but a 2012 publication confirmed its return to Knipolegus. Hudson's black tyrant is monotypic. Description\nHudson's black tyrant is about 15 to 15.5 cm (5.9 to 6.1 in) long. Adult males are almost entirely shiny black. Their wings have a wide white band on the inner webs of the primaries that is very conspicuous in flight but usually hidden when perched. They also has some whitish on the lower flanks. Adult females have a mostly grayish brown head and upperparts with a rufous rump and basal half of the tail. The rest of the tail is grayish brown with a blackish band across the end.",

Their wings are dusky with buff tips on the coverts that show as two wing bars. Their underparts are mostly buffy to ochre with dusky-olive streaks on the breast that extend more lightly onto the belly. Both sexes have a red iris, a blue-gray bill with a black tip, and black legs and feet. Distribution and habitat\nHudson's black tyrant is found from northern Bolivia south through western Paraguay into Argentina as far south as eastern Neuquén, northern Río Negro, and southwestern Buenos Aires provinces. It has also occurred as a vagrant in Brazil and Peru. The species inhabits somewhat open woodland and scrubland; in the north it also inhabits Gran Chaco woodlands, shrubby pastures, and gardens. In elevation it is found mostly below 500 m (1,600 ft). Behavior\nMovement\nHudson's black tyrant is a complete migrant. It breeds from central Argentina south and moves north for the austral winter to northern Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia. Feeding\nHudson's black tyrant feeds on insects. It usually forages in dense cover near the ground. Nothing else is known about its foraging behavior and diet.",

Taylor Swift and Jack Antonoff also received songwriting credits for its interpolation of Swift's 2017 song  New Year's Day . The song's lyrics describe the harmful effects of inconsistent communication on a romantic relationship. Musically,  1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back  is a tender downtempo ballad driven by a damp piano and subtle bass. Upon Sour's release,  1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back  received positive comments from music critics, who complimented its simplistic instrumentation and vulnerable lyrics. Commercially, the song reached the top 20 in Australia, Canada, Singapore, and the United States, and the top 30 in New Zealand and Portugal.

Tenreyro added that the track  seamlessly transitions  into  Deja Vu , the succeeding track on Sour. NME's Rhian Daly said that  1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back  is a  perfectly fine song  but leaves  little impression  due to its location between Rodrigo's familiar singles  Drivers License  and  Deja Vu . Writing for The New York Times, Jon Caramanica asserted that the song, like its fellow tracks, perfects  the precise language for an imprecise, complex emotional situation; and working through private stories in public fashion.

According to Clyde's father, both W.B. and Clyde's uncle, Ira Chandler, were present at the time of the shootout that occurred between Wyatt Earp and his men and the Clanton-McLowery gang. Clyde's parents would eventually move to Southern California but this event would later influence Clyde's work. In the 1890s, his family moved to Los Angeles, California.

In 1904, Forsythe left Los Angeles and traveled to New York to study at the Art Students League, under the tutelage of Frank DuMond. While in New York, Forsythe was hired as an illustrator for the New York World. On June 12, 1906, Clyde married Cotta Owen. Together the couple lived in the well known artist colony of New Rochelle, New York. While living in New Rochelle, Forsythe met a young artist by the name of Norman Rockwell.

Due to his early success, Forsythe began to catch the eye of William Randolph Hearst. Hearst was the publisher of New York World's rival magazine, the New York Journal and recruited Forsythe to work as a cartoonist. Here, Forsythe met fellow painter and cartoonist, Jimmy Swinnerton, with whom he became close friends with. He also met Norman Rockwell in 1914. During World War I, Forsythe was recruited by the Committee on Public Information's Division of Pictorial Publicity, for whom he created a number of war propaganda posters, including his famous  And They Thought We Couldn't Fight  poster. This poster, which was created for the Victory Loan drive, features an American soldier, with a bandaged head, celebrating his victory over the Germans and carrying a German helmet as a souvenir. This poster was thought to be intended to silence the Germans who claimed that the American soldiers were weak. .

    "text": ". Forsythe was also responsible for various illustrations to war stories found in Boys' Life magazine throughout World War I and into the 1920s. After World War I, Forsythe continued to work as a cartoonist. In 1918, he created his most famous cartoon, Joe's Car (later distributed by United Feature Syndicate), which was a comic about a man obsessed with his car. Joe was depicted as a balding, agitated, everyman with an overbearing wife which made the cartoon relatable to the public and made Forsythe successful. In 1928, Forsythe renamed the cartoon from Joe's Car to Joe Jinks, the name of the character. This was done since Joe had gone from being a car-obsessed man to an airplane pilot as well as a boxing manager. Even though Forsythe moved out to California in 1920, he continued to create the Joe Jinks comics until 1933 when he quit. But after pressure from the public to return, Forsythe started creating the Joe Jinks comic again in 1937. This did not last long as he officially retired from the comic the following year in 1938. After moving out to California in 1920, Clyde continued to work on his art. He moved out to Alhambra, California, where he set up a studio with his friend and fellow artist Frank Tenney Johnson.",

He moved out to Alhambra, California, where he set up a studio with his friend and fellow artist Frank Tenney Johnson. In 1923, Forsythe and Johnson helped found a cooperative gallery in downtown Los Angeles, known as the Biltmore Salon, also known as the Biltmore Art Gallery. The art gallery was located at the Biltmore hotel and was designed as a place for artists to showcase their work. While he lived in California, Forsythe began to focus more on desert paintings. These paintings were focused on the desert landscape and features scenes of prospectors and burros, as well as a focus on the sky. After quitting comics in 1938, Forsythe focused his attention on easel painting. Forsythe is often considered one of the fathers of  Desert Painting  along with Maynard Dixon and Jimmy Swinnerton. Forsythe often painted in groups in the desert with these fellow artists. These artist are believed to have influenced a large number of  Desert Painters  and helped influence the desert painting movement. In 1952, he painted Gunfight at O.K. Corral. The 43 by 60 inches (110 by 150 cm) oil painting was regarded by some as the most accurate depiction of the gunfight for many years.",

    "text": "Hong Kong Cemetery, formerly Hong Kong (Happy Valley) Cemetery and before that Hong Kong Colonial Cemetery, is one of the early Christian cemeteries in Hong Kong dating to its colonial era beginning in 1845. It is located beside the racecourse at Happy Valley, along with the Jewish Cemetery, Hindu Cemetery, Parsee Cemetery, St. Michael's Catholic Cemetery and the Muslim Cemetery. Hong Kong Cemetery is a public cemetery managed by the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department. Hong Kong Cemetery contains 79 scattered Commonwealth burials of the First World War and 62 from the Second World War, which are maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. The Protestant Cemetery is built as a series of terraces ascending a hillside. The older graves tend to be at the bottom of the hill; those from the 1930s and 1940s are generally at the top. On a number of occasions, remains in the Protestant Cemetery have been disinterred to make way for road developments, and have been placed in niches in an ossuary, which continues to be used for contemporary cremations. The niches provide basic information on each individual. Types of graves\nSome sections of the Protestant Cemetery tended to be reserved for particular groups of deceased, e.g., army, navy, Hong Kong Police.",

Types of graves\nSome sections of the Protestant Cemetery tended to be reserved for particular groups of deceased, e.g., army, navy, Hong Kong Police. There are two main categories of graves that can be found in Hong Kong Cemetery:\nMilitary graves\nAs the name states, this category of graves for British military dead, spanned from the late 19th century until the early 1960s (when the Government of Hong Kong established another cemetery near Sai Wan for military dead in 1965). At the beginning of the colonial era, the British garrison force had the same problem as those in India: weather. Some of the members of the force could not adapt to the tropical weather of Hong Kong and died owing to tropical disease, while others fell during the Boxer Rebellion   mainly in 1900. At the time being, it is the major cemetery for military dead along with Stanley Military Cemetery. There are about 100 military graves of World War I   79 of them are in Hong Kong Cemetery, mainly the soldiers who died in Hong Kong and Kowloon Military Hospital, which received the sick and wounded from the German-leased territory of Qingdao, on the Shandong peninsula in north-east China. Evidence shows that most of them are naval personnel.",

Before the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong in 1941, Britain had sent two battalions from the Royal Scots and Middlesex Regiments to Hong Kong for garrison duty. This cemetery provides evidence of the presence of these two battalions. There are in all 62 military graves of World War II Commonwealth service personnel   mainly from the year 1941   maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. The British force in Hong Kong used the cemetery as their burial ground until 1965. One notable military burial is Driver Joseph Hughes, a recipient of the George Cross. There are also two monuments erected by the Royal Artillery in memory of their fallen comrades, which were later moved to the Hong Kong Museum of Coastal Defence. Civilian graves\nThe civilian burials in the cemetery are diverse and exemplify the social structure at the early stage of the colonial era. It is widely understood that the cemetery is for the burial of the privileged group of the society, mostly British. Notable people of that era buried in the cemetery include Sir Robert Ho Tung and his first wife, Sir Paul Chater and Sir Kai Ho. Most Christian missionaries to Hong Kong are also buried here, a notable example being Karl Friedrich August Gützlaff, a German missionary who helped to establish Lutheran churches in Hong Kong, who is considered the first Lutheran missionary to China.",

He was drafted in the 42nd round of the 1995 Major League Baseball draft by the Baltimore Orioles but chose instead to go to college. Hairston played college ball at Southern Illinois University in 1996 and 1997, where he batted .360 for his career and was the Missouri Valley Conference Freshman of the Year in 1996. In both years he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League, playing for the Bourne Braves in 1996, and the Wareham Gatemen in 1997.

In 1998, he made a fast rise up the farm system and moved to second base. Starting in High-A with the Frederick Keys, he hit .302 in 80 games. He was promoted to the AA Bowie Baysox, where he hit .326 in 55 games. He was promoted to the majors and made his major league debut with the Orioles on September 11, 1998, against the Anaheim Angels. He appeared in seven games that year, serving primarily as a pinch runner or late-inning defensive replacement. He began the 1999 season in Triple-A with the Rochester Red Wings, before being called up in June to replace the injured Delino DeShields at second base. Hairston hit .277 with two home runs and seven RBI in 25 games before returning to the minors.

However, his patience at the plate did not improve as much as the organization had hoped and second base prospect Brian Roberts was promoted on May 22.

Hairston represented Mexico at the 2009 World Baseball Classic alongside his brother Scott. Hairston's mother was born in Mexico, making him eligible to play for the Mexican team. He had four hits in 14 at-bats for Team Mexico. Hairston hit .254 with a .397 OBP, eight home runs, and 27 RBI in 86 games for Cincinnati, mostly playing second, third, and shortstop. New York Yankees\nOn July 31, 2009, he was traded to the New York Yankees for minor league catcher Chase Weems. The move was made to help shore up the team's bench, with Brett Gardner on the disabled list, and to spell Johnny Damon, Derek Jeter, and Alex Rodriguez when needed. On August 1, Hairston got his first hit and RBI as a Yankee. In his time with the Yankees, he hit .237 with two home runs and 12 RBIs in 45 games\nOn October 17, 2009, he got his first career post-season hit in his first career post-season at-bat, and later ended a 13-inning ALCS Game 2 by scoring on an error by the Angels' Maicer Izturis.

After Everth Cabrera went down with a hamstring injury in April, Hairston became the team's starting shortstop for much of the season's first half. He also replaced David Eckstein at second base when the veteran suffered a calf strain in July. Hairston's 2010 season was cut short by injury. He suffered an elbow injury at the end of August and then broke the tibia in his right leg a week after coming off the disabled list. Hairston still played in 119 games with the Padres, hitting .244 with a career-high 10 home runs (tied with 2009) and 50 RBI, despite playing his home games at notoriously pitcher friendly Petco Park. Washington Nationals\nOn January 19, 2011, Hairston agreed to a one-year,  2 million contract with the Washington Nationals that included over  1 million in incentives.

Milwaukee Brewers\nOn July 30, 2011, Hairston was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers for Double-A outfielder Erik Komatsu.

Los Angeles Dodgers\nOn December 5, 2011, the Los Angeles Dodgers signed Hairston to a two-year contract worth  6 million. On June 1, 2012, Hairston was part of a Dodgers lineup that featured the sons of five former major leaguers (along with Tony Gwynn Jr., Iván DeJesús Jr., Dee Gordon and Scott Van Slyke). This was the first time in Major League history that this had occurred. It was also the first time a starting infield of four major league sons had ever occurred: first baseman Van Slyke, second baseman Hairston, third baseman De Jesus and shortstop Gordon. On August 22, it was determined that Hairston would need surgery on his left hip. The injury had bothered him for some time before he finally went on the disabled list on August 13.

Broadcasting career\nOn December 11, 2013, it was announced that Hairston would be retiring as an active player to join the Dodgers pre and post game broadcasting crew on SportsNet LA. Performance-enhancing drugs controversy\nAccording to a report by Sports Illustrated, Hairston received genotropin, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and clomiphene citrate in 2004. One of Hairston's prescriptions was written by  A. Almarashi. Investigators believe Almarashi is an alias for a Queens, N.Y., doctor stripped of her medical license in 1999. She is awaiting trial on multiple charges after allegedly writing bogus prescriptions for thousands of online customers she never examined.

This was Vaughan's first album with just guitar and double bass accompaniment; it was followed by 1963's Sarah   2 in a similar vein. Reception\nThe AllMusic review by Scott Yanow awarded After Hours three stars and said that  the emphasis throughout is exclusively on Sassy's magnificent voice. The program mostly sticks to ballads, with a couple of exceptions...and is a quiet and intimate affair, with Vaughan more subtle than she sometimes was. Despite a lightweight version of 'My Favorite Things' that will not remind listeners of John Coltrane, this is an excellent if brief set (34-and-a-half minutes) with some fine jazz singing .

    "text": "In information science and ontology, a classification scheme is an arrangement of classes or groups of classes. The activity of developing the schemes bears similarity to taxonomy, but with perhaps a more theoretical bent, as a single classification scheme can be applied over a wide semantic spectrum while taxonomies tend to be devoted to a single topic. In the abstract, the resulting structures are a crucial aspect of metadata, often represented as a hierarchical structure and accompanied by descriptive information of the classes or groups. Such a classification scheme is intended to be used for the classification of individual objects into the classes or groups, and the classes or groups are based on characteristics which the objects (members) have in common. The ISO IEC 11179 metadata registry standard uses classification schemes as a way to classify administered items, such as data elements, in a metadata registry. Some quality criteria for classification schemes are:\nWhether different kinds are grouped together. In other words, whether it is a grouping system or a pure classification system. In the case of grouping, a subset (subgroup) does not have (inherit) all the characteristics of the superset, which means that the knowledge and requirements about the superset are not applicable for the members of the subset. Whether the classes have overlaps. Whether subordinates are allowed to have multiple superordinates. Some classification schemes allow that a kind of thing has more than one superordinate, others do not.",

    "text": "Razzie Award for Worst Actress is an award presented at the annual Golden Raspberry Awards to the worst actress of the previous year. Male actors performing in drag are eligible, as it is intended as a humorous award. The following is a list of recipients and nominees of that award, along with the films for which they were nominated. The category of  actress  has expanded to include the subjects of documentary films. To date, two nominations have been rescinded. On March 31, 2022, the Golden Raspberry committee decided to rescind Shelley Duvall's nomination for her performance in The Shining, stating that it was recently brought to their attention that the performance was affected by the intense treatment she received from director Stanley Kubrick and that they didn't wish to punish victims. On January 24, 2023, a day after announcing the nominees for the 43rd Golden Raspberry Awards, the Razzies decided to rescind their nomination for Ryan Kiera Armstrong after facing immense backlash for what was publicly perceived as cruel, given the fact that Armstrong was a minor at the time of the nomination. Winners and nominees\n1980s\n1990s\n2000s\n2010s\n2020s\nAge superlatives\nNote: Ryan Kiera Armstrong was initially nominated for Firestarter at the age of 12-13 years, but was later removed from nominations after it caused widespread backlash.",

History\nThe Sunderland arc Task Group was originally appointed in June 2002 by the former Trade and Industry Secretary, Rt. Hon. Stephen Byers MP. This followed the closures and associated job losses at Grove Cranes and the Vaux Brewery, both of which were key private employers in traditional industries close to the City Centre. The Task Group was charged with developing and implementing a strategic vision to tackle the severe economic and social problems facing a substantial area of Sunderland and its communities. The resulting framework, set out a fifteen-year vision for the Sunderland arc area that would radically transform the heart of Sunderland. The strategic objectives outlined in the framework are detailed below. To accelerate the revival of Sunderland, integrating major physical\nredevelopment with comprehensive social regeneration in support of\nthe Government's National Strategy for Neighbourhood Renewal and\nthe Urban White Paper.

The Arc made significant progress in the Sunniside area, with the opening of a new arts centre, several new bars and restaurants, new business space, a new leisure complex incorporating a bowling alley and multiplex cinema, hundreds of new apartments, and a new area of public art and sculpture on a newly landscaped Sunniside Gardens. The Sunniside district, which lies on the eastern fringe of Sunderland City Centre, was awarded with the North East Renaissance Award from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. One of the main thrusts over the first five years of the arc was the company moving a proposed Tesco Extra from a city centre site, the former Vaux Brewery site. For over five years Tesco did not wish to move and a very substantial planning dispute involving large teams of planners, architects, surveyors and legal experts ensued.

The museum had 84,496 visitors in 2007. History\nThe museum occupies the Mudéjar Pavilion (Pabellón Mudéjar) designed by Aníbal González and built in 1914. It served as an art pavilion, the Pabellón de Arte Antiguo, for the Ibero-American Exposition of 1929, when Aníbal González had the opportunity to design several additional permanent buildings for the plaza. The exterior is ceramic over brick, and has three doors with archivolts adorned with glazed tiles (azulejos). The building originally consisted of two stories over an aeration chamber (necessary because of the humidity). In the 1960s, the main floor, originally over 12 metres (39 ft) high, was divided in two, with an intermediate level added by architect Delgado Roig. In 1972, as part of the preparations for the current museum, the various stories of the building were connected by a grand spiral staircase designed by José Galnares Sagastizábal.",

The museum was established by a decree of 23 March 1972, initially as a section of the Museum of Fine Arts of Seville. It opened its doors to the public 4 March 1973. For the next seven years, the museum fell under the responsibility of the Ministry of Education and Science, but the city government occupied more than half of the poorly maintained building. Neither institution took full responsibility. This situation led to a series of temporary closures. In 1976, the electric bill could not be paid, and the museum had to be shut until it could get power again. In 1979, heavy rains damaged the interior. On 26 March 1980, the City Council agreed to allow the Ministry of Education and Science to use the whole building, for as long as it was used for the museum, on the condition that the Ministry would suitably restore it. On this basis, the Ministry hired architect Fernando Villanueva Sandino. The resulting restoration converted the primitive aeration chamber into a new lower-ground floor. The museum reopened 18 October 1984; at that same time the new Andalusian Autonomous Government took over the museum, along with other museums in Andalusia that had been operated by the central government of Spain.",

The short film has a comedic version of a typical haunted house tale, and a dispute over a family's inheritance. A young woman is the heiress to a mansion and a plantation, but only if she is married. She quickly enters an arranged marriage with a stranger, and they travel to the mansion. Her uncle fakes ghostly apparitions, in order to scare them away and lay claim to the inheritance. At the end of the film, the husband and wife remember to enquire about their respective names. Plot\nThe action in Haunted Spooks centres around Harold's romantic problems. It is set in the South (  go  down the Mississippi and turn to the right ). The opening sequence has an uncle reading a telegram regarding a will. It tells him that his niece Mildred will inherit the house and plantation, provided she lives there for a year with her husband. He tells his wife that they must scare them out of the house. A lawyer visits the niece to tell her of the will. She tells him she is not married and he says he can resolve the problem. We then jump to Harold who is disappointed in love and vying for the attention of the Other Girl in rivalry with her other potential suitor.

He then tries, with notable lack of success, to commit suicide. Firstly using a gun he finds on a path, which turns out to be a water-pistol; then standing in front of a tram, which takes a sudden turn; then he ties a rock around his neck and jumps off a low bridge into a lake, but this fails as it is only inches deep; he then picks a second bridge, but lands in a boat; and finally stands in front of a car, which stops in time, but contains the lawyer from the earlier scene. He takes Harold to Mildred and arranges their marriage. They then drive off to the mansion, with some jokes en route: the gesticulating passengers in the car in front appear to be signalling right then left, preventing overtaking; the birds in the back seat pecking his head.

Lloyd was posing for publicity photos, and a prop bomb exploded in his hand. He lost two fingers, his face was badly burned and he was temporarily blinded. In subsequent films, he wore a prosthetic glove fitted with artificial fingers. After four months of recovering the film resumed on January 5, 1920 and continued through the 25th.",

    "text": "In subsequent films, he wore a prosthetic glove fitted with artificial fingers. After four months of recovering the film resumed on January 5, 1920 and continued through the 25th. There was very little public knowledge about the loss of Lloyd's fingers, but people knew of the accident. Lloyd wanted it that way because he did not want people to watch his films for sympathy or curiosity, but to watch his films  because they were good, laughable, and delightful comedies . Lloyd's salary doubled after his return to this film. After this movie, he moved away from slapstick and went towards more intellectual \nand romantic comedies. Three years after this film was made, Harold Lloyd married his co-star Mildred Davis, whose brother Jack was a member of Hal Roach's Our Gang comedies. They remained married until her death in 1969. Haunted Spooks was filmed on location at Hancock Park and what is now MacArthur Park. The scenes at the haunted mansion were filmed at Hal Roach Studios, in Culver City, California. The film had a lot of racist humor in it, revolving mainly around the frightened black servants in the house showing then-stereotypical behavior such as shaking knees and wide eyes. One of the servants was even played by a white actor in blackface. One can even conclude that the film's title is a racist slur  according to critic Christopher Workman.",

    "text": "The Tatra K1 was an experimental tramcar developed by ČKD Tatra between 1964 and 1965. History\nPrevious Tatra units were concerned primarily with increasing capacity in a single tramcar. Tatra sought to correct this shortcoming by developing its first articulated tramcar, the K1. The K1 was largely based on the established T3, although certain electrical aspects were adjusted for the K1. In 1965, two prototypes were built with numbers 7000 and 801 (the second prototype never had the number 7001) with electro-pneumatic equipment UA 11. The second one was shipped to Ostrava. After a short trial in Prague with the prototype 7000, it entered Ostrava service with 800. They remained there for three years until October 1, 1968, before it was returned to the manufacturer. The test runs exposed problems with the electronic equipment. Thus, the two prototypes were the only ones ever produced. The first prototype underwent reconstruction to functional sample KTX (later KT4) with a shortened body, in 1969. This sample was subjected to the test drives. It was sent in 1971 into Liberec on meter gauge. From Liberec, it was sent back in the winter of 1972 73. After this prototype was renumbered to 8004, it took on new thyristor electric equipment TV 2.",

Personal life\nDeltchev began gymnastics when he was 10; he initially played football, and his father noticed his athleticism and decided to put him in a more individual sport. He has a daughter, Deliana. Career\nDeltchev competed at the 1977 European Championships, where he won the gold medal in the horizontal bar final. That year, at an invitational competition in Riga, he first competed the horizontal bar move now named after him, which was the first aerial release move on the apparatus. The following year, he competed at the 1978 World Championships, where he finished eighth in the all-around and won two bronze medals in the apparatus finals, one in pommel horse and the other with the horizontal bar, where he tied with Gennady Krysin. In 1979, Deltchev won the all-around at the 1979 European Championships. He was the first man representing a country outside the Soviet Union to win the competition in fourteen years.",

Deltchev represented Bulgaria at the 1980 Summer Olympics, where he won the all-around bronze medal. In the event finals, he became the Olympic champion on the horizontal bar. In an interview about his career in 2002, Deltchev reflected on how he trained many different skills that he was not able to put into his competitive routines, as he was Bulgaria's main gymnast during his career and often traveled to compete. He first succeeded with his eponymous high bar move after watching another gymnast attempt it at his gym; the gymnast's coach encouraged Deltchev to try it, and he managed to regrab the bar on his third attempt. He claimed he invented his eponymous move on the rings by accident after his grip became stuck on the rings. After he finished competing, Deltchev went to Liverpool, England to coach for several months, before he moved to the United States in 1991.

    "text": "A caucus chair is a person who chairs the meetings of a caucus. Often, the caucus chair is assigned other duties as well. Canada\nIn Canada, the elected members of each party in Parliament, including senators, or a provincial legislature, elect among themselves a caucus chair who presides over their meetings. This person is an important figure when the party is in opposition and an important link between cabinet and the backbench when the party is in government. United States\nIn common U.S. Congressional Republican caucus legislative usage, the caucus chairman is styled conference chairman and is outranked by the Speaker or Senate President pro-tempore, and the leader or whip of his party. The duties of a caucus chairman depend upon the political party caucus. In the Republican Conference in the U.S. House of Representatives, for instance, the caucus chairman is in charge of coordinating the party's overall message. The position of caucus chairman may or may not lead to higher office. Republican conference chair John Anderson and Democratic Caucus Chair Richard Gephardt unsuccessfully sought their party's Presidential nominations in 1980 and 1988 respectively. Anderson took his following and ran as a third party presidential candidate the same year, and never again achieved national prominence as a Republican. Gephardt though was elected as the Democratic leader of the House of Representatives in 1989, and stayed in that position through 2002, before stepping down to run unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for President again in 2004.",

Gephardt helped nominate John Kerry by promptly endorsing him after Kerry defeated him in the Iowa caucuses. Many state legislative bodies have caucus chairmen for both party caucuses in the House and in the Senate. The duties of the caucus chairman, as with the federal government, depend on the decisions of the caucus. The number of times each caucus meets, the role of each caucus in aiding legislative decision-making, the interrelationships with other caucus leaders and memberships, the assignment of political and institutional duties, all vary in accordance with local traditions and personalities. Caucuses do not always function well. In Congress in the 1950s, for instance, the House Democratic Caucus met so infrequently that insurgent Democrats formed the House Democratic Study Group, led by Rep. Eugene J. McCarthy, later a U.S. Senator and Presidential candidate, to do the work of reviewing legislation now generally done by caucuses under the direction of the caucus chairmen. Caucuses have zealously guarded their prerogatives from the executive branch. When outgoing Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson became Vice-President, the President of the Senate, he suggested that his duties should include presiding over the Senate Democratic Caucus.",

The association was established in 2018 as the Central Coast Athletic Conference and consists of 16 schools in San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties that previously were members of the CIF Southern Section and three of its constituent conferences, the Pac-8, the Los Padres League, and the Channel League. In earlier decades, previously-branded leagues such as the Northern League, Central Coast League and Tri-County League were also home to several of the 16 total schools, realigned over the years largely due to enrollment, which today comprise the overall spectrum of the association.

He studied biology and geology at the university of Groningen and geology and the history of science at Princeton and Oxford. Early in his studies, Rupke was a Christian and proponent of Flood geology, but later came to reject this position. When in 1977 he was elected to a Wolfson College, Oxford research position in the history of science, Rupke made this subject his full-time occupation. A series of similar international research posts followed, until in 1993 he took up a professorship at Göttingen University to teach the history of science and medicine. In 2009, Rupke was awarded a Lower Saxony research chair. In 2012, he took up an endowed professorship at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia, USA. Rupke is known for his studies of late-modern biology, geology and science   religion. With an interest in the biographical approach, he restored to their contemporary prominence several nineteenth-century scientists, most important among them Richard Owen who well before the appearance of The Origin of Species developed a naturalistic theory of evolution, albeit a non-Darwinian one.",

The novel was followed by the sequels Hunter's Moon and Last Hunt, both released in 2025 via WildBlue Press. Plot\nNathaniel Hunter, an expert tracker, with his wolf companion Ghost, finds a child lost in a snow storm. Deep in the Arctic Circle, a facility is attacked by a hulking creature. Colonel Maddox, Major Westcott, and the mysterious Dixon, consult with Dr. Tipler to identify the footprints and carnage left behind by the beast. Dr. Tipler deduces the creature kills similar to a grizzly but the footprints do not match that of a bear and recommends seeking the help of Hunter. The trio seek Hunter's help and he too is unable to identify the species. Colonel Maddox asks Hunter to lead a kill team to track and kill the beast. Hunter is initially hesitant but accepts the job. Hunter meets the kill team led by Commander Takakura. Against Hunter's wishes, Dr. Tipler also joins the team as an observer. Bobbi Jo, the team's sniper, is assigned to lead the hunt alongside Hunter, whom which she bonds with over the course of the journey.

Back at Dr. Tipler's institute, his assistants Gina and Rebecca examine a cast made from the creature's footprints. They recover a tendril from the plaster and Rebecca attempts to have the CIA's physicist Dr. Hamilton examine it. Rebecca stresses that whatever the animal is, it is immune to disease but Dr. Hamilton shrugs off her theories and after she leaves, orders a hit on her. Rebecca is then killed in a car accident. Hunter and the team find the creature but the mission backfires when the beast begins hunting them and kills several soldiers. Dr. Tipler becomes sick, and the team is unable to radio for an extraction due to sabotage.

    "text": "Salvador Puig Antich (Catalan pronunciation:  səlβəˈðo ˌpudʒ ənˈtik ; 30 May 1948   2 March 1974) was a Spanish militant anarchist from Catalonia. His execution for involvement in a bank robbery and shooting a police officer dead became a cause célèbre in Francoist Spain for Catalan autonomists, pro-independence supporters, and anarchists. After fighting the Spanish state with the militant organization Iberian Liberation Movement in the early 1970s, he was convicted and executed by garrote for the death of a police officer during a shoot-out. Far left-wing Catalans viewed Puig Antich's judicial death as symbolic retribution for the region's fight for self-government, and his name became commonplace in Barcelona. The incident inspired works by Catalan artists Joan Miró and Antoni Tàpies, and a satirical play by the Catalan theater group Els Joglars. The 2006 film Salvador depicts Puig Antich's time on death row. After the Spanish Supreme Court declined an effort to review the execution, an Argentine court adopted the case under universal jurisdiction in 2013.

He was a member of the Workers' Commissions before he joined the Iberian Liberation Movement (Movimiento Ibérico de Liberación, or MIL). The group organized armed robberies against banks, which they called  expropriations , allegedly to fund their actions against Francoist Spain in 1972 and 1973. Puig Antich was meanwhile in London: Albert Melzer recalls him being  among the circle of anarchist activists who gathered in London around Miguel García García in the early days of the Centro Iberico  (Camden Town). He returned to Spain in September 1973. After a series of these robberies, he was arrested for the death of a police inspector during a shootout in the Calle Gerona, Barcelona. A military court sentenced him to death by garrote vil in the Model prison. His execution in March 1974 proceeded despite international outcry, as Spain's second state execution in eight years.

He was known as Heinz Ches because he declared it was his name and to be Polish, from Szczecin. The execution of Georg Michael Welzel, a common criminal, was seen as an intent of the Francoist regime to downplay the importance of the execution of a political activist like Puig Antich. Legacy\nSome Catalans interpreted Puig Antich's execution as symbolic retaliation for the region's fight for autonomy, which led to public demonstrations. As one of the last convicted revolutionaries executed by Franco, Puig Antich became a household name in Barcelona. The Internationalist Revolutionary Action Groups (GARI) formed to avenge his death. Several years after his 1974 execution, the Catalan performance group Els Joglars performed La torna, a 1977 satire against torture based on the execution of Puig Antich and Heinz Ches. Even though Francoist Spain had ended, along with its censorship laws, members of Els Joglars were jailed or forced into exile. Spanish theater groups protested across Spain.

Miró's The Hope of a Condemned Man triptych features a line that  sighs and falls with faltering resignation  and flicked paint. Tàpies's Assassins lithograph series, presented at the Parisian Galerie Maeght, too was inspired by Puig Antich's execution and Spanish politics. The 2006 film Salvador depicts Puig Antich's time spent on death row. An effort by family members and outside groups to review Puig Antich's case was rejected by the Spanish Supreme Court in 2007, but an Argentinian judge adopted the case along with several others under universal jurisdiction in 2013. In February 2025, the Ministry of Territorial Policy and Democratic Memory under Ángel Víctor Torres declared the trial of Puig Antich to have been  illegal  and formally nullified his death sentence.

After his death, the chair of the British Fashion Council Harold Tillman described him as:  a great designer, retailer and entrepreneur . Le Figaro fashion editor Godfrey Deeny has described him as:  one of the half dozen greatest fashion retailers in the past half-century . Early life and career\nBorn in Casablanca, Morocco, on February 22, 1936, Joseph Ettedgui was the son of a Moroccan Jewish furniture retailer. Joseph s father considered retailing to be a degrading profession and hoped his son would become a doctor or lawyer. Joseph had no such ambitions and moved to London with his brother Maurice in 1960 to train as a hairdresser. Two years later the brothers opened a hairdressing salon (Salon 33) in King's Road, Chelsea   one of the epicentres of Swinging London. In 1964, their brother Franklin joined them. In an interview in 1989 with the Jewish Chronicle, Joseph said:  I really wanted to be an architect but I'm terribly impatient. I decided to take a course in hairdressing and I loved it; I loved the way you could transform someone in two hours .",

Move into fashion retail\nJoseph Ettedgui began travelling to Paris to see the ready-to-wear collections. This led to a meeting and early business association with Japanese designer Kenzo Takada. He began to sell Kenzo sweaters in Salon 33, and in 1972 the first Joseph clothes store opened underneath the hairdressing premises. Kenzo sweaters in the store s window were spotted by then Sunday Times fashion editor Michael Roberts and used in a photo shoot   a move credited with simultaneously launching both minimalist European fashion and the Joseph retail name to a wider UK audience. A high-tech Norman Foster-designed flagship store opened in Sloane Street, Knightsbridge in 1979, after which Joseph Ettedgui s place as a retail pioneer was cemented. During the 1980s, own-brand knitwear and clothing were introduced. The Joseph brand expanded into restaurants (Joe s Café) and homeware (Joseph Pour la Maison). Stores opened across London and other major fashion centres, including New York, Paris and Tokyo. Influence and legacy\nJoseph Ettedgui assisted emerging fashion designers, including Margaret Howell, Katharine Hamnett, John Galliano and Azzedine Alaïa.

    "text": "The Prince of Carbery (Irish: Rí Mór Túath Chairbreach) is the traditional designation used by the head of the MacCarthy Reagh dynasty, a historic Gaelic-Irish ruling family based in what is now West Cork, Ireland. The title derives from the medieval lordship and later principality of Carbery, which emerged following the fragmentation of the Kingdom of Desmond in the 13th century. It was established in 1281 for Donal Maol MacCarthy, the 2nd Lord of Carbery, after a treaty settlement with his cousin, Donal Roe MacCarthy, King of Desmond. Although no longer a sovereign title under Irish law, Prince of Carbery continues to be used in a cultural, historical, and genealogical context by the recognised head of the MacCarthy Reagh dynasty. Historical Background\nThe Principality of Carbery arose after the division of the MacCarthy dynasty in the middle of the 13th century, when the MacCarthy dynasty came to the height of their authority over the southern territories in Munster. By 1251 Donal Gott MacCarthy, King of Desmond, died having consolidate the new territory of Carbery for his own son, who exercised authority over much of what is now West Cork, including coastal territories and inland lordships. It is from his progeny that the MacCarthy Reagh sept would stem.",

Medieval rule\nFrom the 13th to the late 16th century, the Princes of Carbery governed as Gaelic rulers under Brehon law, maintaining their own military forces, client lordships, and diplomatic relations. They were intermittently allied with or opposed to the Earls of Desmond and later interacted with the English Crown during the Tudor conquest of Ireland. While contemporary Irish sources typically styled the ruler of Carbery as Mac Carthaigh Riabhach, European genealogists and historians particularly in French and Spanish works frequently rendered the position as Prince of Carbery to reflect the scale and autonomy of the lordship. Decline and dispossession\nFollowing the Desmond Rebellions and the subsequent Plantation of Munster, the political autonomy of Carbery was progressively dismantled. By the early 17th century, much of the MacCarthy Reagh territorial power had been lost through confiscation, surrender, or sale, though elements of the family retained land. Finally, Donal na Pipi, 17th Prince of Carbery, saw few options available to him to retain his family's station and so decided to surrender Carbery under the notorious Surrender and Regrant policy in 1606.",

The Modern Era\nChiefship of the Name\nThe lordship of Carbery was established in the 13th century by the sitting King of Desmond, and was passed to his descendants over the next four generations, it was his great-great-grandson (Donal Reagh MacCarthy) to be regarded as the founder and namesake of the MacCarthy Reagh clan itself. In the modern era, Prince of Carbery is used as a courtesy and traditional title by the Chief of the Name of MacCarthy Reagh, to reflect continuity with the medieval ruling house after a 400-year 'interregnum.'\nCultural and philanthropic role\nThe current chief manages endeavours to preserve the history of Carbery, promote Irish clan heritage, and support charitable initiatives to fight against poverty. Succession\nSuccession to the chiefship traditionally followed Gaelic tanistry, but with the collapse of the Gaelic order and the death of Finghin of Banduff (the last Chief) in 1754, the chiefship fell into abeyance.",

U-14 completed six wartime patrols and sank nine ships totalling 12,344 GRT. Design\nGerman Type IIB submarines were enlarged versions of the original Type IIs. U-14 had a displacement of 279 tonnes (275 long tons) when at the surface and 328 tonnes (323 long tons) while submerged. Officially, the standard tonnage was 250 long tons (254 t), however. The U-boat had a total length of 42.70 m (140 ft 1 in), a pressure hull length of 28.20 m (92 ft 6 in), a beam of 4.08 m (13 ft 5 in), a height of 8.60 m (28 ft 3 in), and a draught of 3.90 m (12 ft 10 in).",

She had two shafts and two 0.85 m (3 ft) propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to 80 150 metres (260 490 ft). The submarine had a maximum surface speed of 12 knots (22 km h; 14 mph) and a maximum submerged speed of 7 knots (13 km h; 8.1 mph). When submerged, the boat could operate for 35 42 nautical miles (65 78 km; 40 48 mi) at 4 knots (7.4 km h; 4.6 mph); when surfaced, she could travel 3,800 nautical miles (7,000 km; 4,400 mi) at 8 knots (15 km h; 9.2 mph).

    "text": "The boat had a complement of twentyfive. Service history\nEarly in the war, on 3 September 1939 in the evening, U-14 attacked a Polish submarine with one torpedo from a surface, and claimed to have sunk it. In reality the Polish submarine, ORP Sęp, was not damaged as the torpedo launched by U-14 exploded prematurely. According to Jan Bartelski, the torpedo also missed the target. After serving on six operational patrols, U-14 was used as a training boat and transferred to U-boat training flotillas, serving with the 23rd and 24th U-boat Flotillas until the end of the war. Despite the high casualties suffered by the Unterseebootwaffen (German submarine arm), U-14 suffered no known casualties during the war. U-14 was scuttled on 5 May 1945 at Wilhelmshaven.

Season summary\nFollowing the departures of key frontmen John Hartson and Carl Cort, Wimbledon were unable to make an immediate return to the top flight and finished in 8th, five points short of the playoffs; were it not for their mediocre home form (with 11 draws and only 7 wins all season) they could have aimed for a playoff spot or even an attempt for automatic promotion. Despite this disappointing season, Wimbledon did enjoy some highlights, including a 5 0 win of London rivals Queens Park Rangers at home and a 5 0 win over Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough. Wimbledon's struggle to return to the top flight was only made harder with the sale of the club's top scorer, Jason Euell, to South London rivals Charlton Athletic at the end of the season.

    "text": "A fag hag is, in gay slang, a woman who associates either mostly or exclusively with gay and bisexual men. The phrase originated in gay male culture in the United States and United Kingdom and was historically an insult. Some women who associate with gay men object to being called fag hags while others embrace the term. The male counterpart, for heterosexual men who have similar interpersonal relationships with gay and bisexual men, is fag stag. Usage\nFag hags are frequently stereotyped as outgoing women who are seeking a substitute for heterosexual relationships, or who are secretly (or openly) sexually attracted to gay men. In fact, many women who identify as fag hags are already in romantic relationships, either with straight men or with women, but seek out the alternative experience of socializing with gay men. Related terms\nAmerican fag hag synonyms include fruit fly, queen bee, homo honey, fruit loop, Goldilocks, flame dame, fairy princess, gabe (a portmanteau of  gay  and  babe ) and fairy godmother. In the case of friendships between lesbians and gay men, the term dyke diva describes the gay man in the relationship. A straight man of platonic affinity with gay men is a fag stag; again, the usage is rare in mainstream sexual culture. For men who have many lesbian friends the slang terms dutch boy, lesbro or dyke tyke apply.",

For men who have many lesbian friends the slang terms dutch boy, lesbro or dyke tyke apply. Heterosexuals who associate with lesbian, gay, and bisexual people may be called fruit flies regardless of their sex. Fag hags, fag stags, etc. are regarded as belonging to the phenomenon of  hagism , the attachment of a person to a group defined by sexuality, even though they do not personally share that identity. In the Philippines, heterosexual women who develop deep friendships or almost exclusively associate with the native bakla LGBT subculture are known as babaeng bakla (literally  a woman who is a bakla  gay man  ). They stereotypically acquire the mannerisms, campy sense of humor, lingo (swardspeak), and fashion sense of the bakla. They are also usually more extroverted and socially dominant. It is commonly perceived as a positive self-identification, and various prominent local celebrities (like Maricel Soriano and Rufa Mae Quinto) openly identify as babaeng bakla.

Design and development\nThe La-190 was an all-metal aircraft with a bicycle undercarriage and mid set wings with 55  sweep at 1 4 chord. The afterburning, Lyul'ka AL-5 (TR-3A), axial flow turbo-jet engine was attached to the rear of the centre fuselage with the air intake at the extreme nose, and exhaust at the end of the rear fuselage. Access to the engine for maintenance and removal was gained by removing the rear fuselage aft of the wing. The bicycle main and nose undercarriages were housed entirely within the fuselage with wing mounted outriggers in small pods at the wingtips. To increase the angle of incidence of the aircraft, to 20 22 , for take-off and landing, the twin wheeled levered suspension main undercarriage could be shortened or  knelt . The swept wings were of medium taper with 2 3 span flaps   1 3 span ailerons, and wing fences at approximately 1 2 span. The tail unit comprised a sharply swept fin with a delta tailplane at 2 3 fin length.",

An early Soviet Airborne Interception radar was also fitted called Korshun   (Kite (the bird)), with a single aerial under a radome above the intake and a CRT for the pilot to manually track the target. History\nThe unusual layout of the La-190, combined with many innovations, including powered flying controls, and new manufacturing methods, challenged Lavochkin's design bureau. To assist with design, many test rigs were made to simulate parts of the aircraft and its systems. Aerodynamic models were also used in wind tunnels and as large-scale droppable gliding models. Despite all the preparations, major problems with the Lyul'ka engine caused several flame-outs, one of which caused serious damage during the ensuing deadstick landing. Although the La-190 displayed good performance during the limited flight testing carried out, the MAP   Ministerstvo Aviatsionnoy Promyshlennosti (Ministry of Aviation Industry) cancelled further work on Aircraft 190.

He played twelve first-class matches for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), and also appeared for Middlesex and Somerset. A right-handed batsman, he occasionally played as wicket-keeper. Life and career\nBorn in Grenada, British West Indies, Ross was educated at the Hermitage School, Bath, then became a student in the Middle Temple and later a barrister. He practised in both London and Bath. In 1869, while playing for Gentlemen of Sussex against the Players of Sussex, he scored 101 in the second-innings after being promoted from batting at number eleven in the first-innings to opening in the second. A prolific scorer in club cricket, he hit six centuries in 1871. On his first-class debut however, Ross made a pair for the Gentlemen. He played one match for Middlesex in 1876, making 35   1 during a draw with Oxford University. During the late 1870s, Ross played a number of matches for the 'Gentlemen of Somerset', a team of amateurs that were forerunners for Somerset County Cricket Club.

She was also depicted in a poster for the Folies Bergère. She was the star of Troupe Kaira, a traveling circus act, and performed with the Cirque Fernando, based in Montmartre. Early life\nLa La was born either Anna Olga Albertina Brown or Olga Brown in the then German Prussian territory of Stettin (now Szczecin) to a black father and white mother. She was the fifth child of Marie Christine Borchardt, a German Jew (related to the circus owner Willy Borchardt), and William Wilhelm Brown, most likely a freedman from USA or United Kingdom. All five children were baptized in a Lutheran church in Stettin-Bredow. Career\nLa La began touring as a child, approximately around age nine, when her mother placed her in the circus. An article claimed that fourteen year old Anna Olga traveled to New York, to hone her circus craft before officially debuting in 1879. At age 21, La La became the subject of Edgar Degas's sketches, leading to his 1879 painting Miss La La at the Cirque Fernando.",

She used multiple stage names throughout her career including Olga the Negress, Venus of the Tropics, African Princess, and Olga the Mulatto. She was also billed as La Femme Canon, La Mulatresse-Canon, and Black Venus. She played venues such as the Folies Bergère in Paris, the Royal Aquarium in London, and the Gaiety Theatre in Manchester. Olga often performed in duet with Graetz-born Theophila Szterker as Olga and Kaira,  Black and White Butterflies . With Troupe Kaira, La La performed a flying trapeze and human cannon ball act. One of her signature acts involved being  pulled up to the height of the circus tent by biting down on a rope. The feat was performed at the height of 200 feet. Another signature stunt involved hoisting other people or a 200-pound cannon with her teeth. She was also known for her stunt of being hoisted up to her trapeze by her teeth. In 1888 Theophila died following a rehearsal trapeze accident, and after that La La retired from the circus.

Bribery charge\nBefore he assumed his Senate seat, Dietrich accepted money from Jacob Fisher in exchange for obtaining Fisher's appointment as a U.S. Postmaster. Dietrich and Fisher were charged with conspiracy to receive a bribe, accepting a bribe and profiting by the leasing of a building to the government. But before the trial could begin, Judge Vandeventer held that Dietrich could not be prosecuted because the alleged bribery occurred after he was elected, but before Dietrich had been sworn in on December 2, 1901.

Overview\nEvery community in the fifty states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Republic of the Marshall Islands, and Republic of Palau, was associated with a Local WIB (LWIB). For each LWIB, a chief elected official (for example, a county commissioner or the mayor of a lead city) appointed members to sit on the WIB. These appointed positions were unpaid. At least 50  of a WIB's membership was required to come from private businesses. There were also designated seats for representatives from labor unions and educational institutions like community colleges as well. Beyond these basic guidelines, many aspects of how an individual WIB operated could vary.

Description\n(Original description in German) Based on the available material, this is the largest species in its genus. While its general shape is similar to Prosipho gaussianus Thiele, 1912, it is uniquely distinguished by its initial whorls, which are covered in sparse, narrow radial folds rather than being smooth. A fresh shell of this species also features rows of fairly long, horny bristles. The largest available specimen measures 11.5 mm high and 5.5 mm wide and has 5 whorls. The first two whorls show only the characteristic folds, which continue onto the third whorl before gradually fading. As a result, the last two whorls only exhibit the spiral ridges and dense growth lines. The third whorl begins with only three ridges, which quickly increase to seven above the aperture. The body whorl has four distinct ridges and some less prominent ones on the lower process. The whorls are convex, and the body whorl is large with a straight lower process. The aperture is long and quite narrow, with an outer margin that is arched at the top and almost straight at the bottom. Distribution\nThis species occurs in the Davis Sea and the Ross Sea, Antarctica.",

It is named after Dom Pérignon, a Benedictine monk who was an important quality pioneer for Champagne wine but who, contrary to popular myths, did not discover the Champagne method for making sparkling wines. History\nThe first vintage of Dom Pérignon was 1921, and was only released for sale in 1936, sailing to New York on the SS Normandie. The brand, not exploited, was given by Champagne Mercier to Moët in 1927 for a wedding between the two families. In 1935, 300 bottles of a 1926-vintage precursor to Dom Pérignon were sold to Simon Bros. Co., the company that imported Moët in the United Kingdom, who gave two bottles to each of their 150 best customers to commemorate their centenary. While these bottles were almost identical to the subsequent Dom Pérignon releases, they did not display the Dom Pérignon name, rather  Champagne specially shipped for Simon Brothers   Co's Centenary 1835 1935. The wine got immediate attention in the marketplace and 100 boxes of the 1921 vintage were shipped to the United States shortly thereafter, this time displaying the Dom Pérignon name.",

James Buchanan Duke, the billionaire who founded the American Tobacco Company, ordered 100 bottles for himself. The 17 bottles sold at an auction in Christie's in New York City in June 2004 were part of that order (Doris Duke, the billionaire's daughter, had kept them in her cellar). According to Dom Pérignon cellar master Richard Geoffroy, who was Chef de Cave for Dom Pérignon from 1990 to 2018, the 1921 vintage had a  distinctive bouquet comprising sandalwood, vanilla and praline . Until the 1943 vintage, Dom Pérignon was produced from regular vintage Moët   Chandon Champagne that was transferred to the special 18th century-style bottles after extended cellaring. It was, thus, effectively an  oenothèque  release of Moët   Chandon Vintage Champagne in a different bottle. From the 1947 vintage, Dom Pérignon has been produced separately from the start.

A bottle of that champagne, from that order, was sold at auction for  24,758 in 2008. In 1981, Dom Pérignon was chosen for the wedding of Lady Diana Spencer and Prince Charles. The magnums of Dom Pérignon Vintage 1961 served on that July 29 carried a special insignia created just for the ceremony. Vintages\nDom Pérignon is always a vintage champagne, meaning that all grapes used to make the wine were harvested in the same year. The wine is not made in weak years, i.e. when the general quality of the harvest is considered to be too low. The earliest market release of a vintage is usually after 8-10 years for the standard champagne, with longer maturation times for special editions like the Second Plenitude or Œnotheque (see below). From 1921 to 2013, Dom Pérignon champagne has been produced in 45 vintages. More than two vintage years in a row is a rare phenomenon, which until 2006 had only occurred three times: 1969 1971, 1998 2000, and 2002 2006 (the first time five vintages were produced in a row).",

Around 2016, the producer stopped using the Œnothèque designation and started labeling new plénitude releases as P2 or P3, providing more clarity to the disgorgement date than the Œnothèque designation. The grapes entering the blend come from the best, most sunlit sites.

    "text": "The Rampenloch (German pronunciation:  ˈʁampn ˌlɔx ) is a street in the East Westphalian city of Minden in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. For a long time the street consisted almost exclusively of brothels. Today the brothels are gone and the street is to be redeveloped. The history of prostitution in Minden can be traced back to the Middle Ages. The first written records come from this time; it attracted particular attention at the beginning of the 19th century during the Prussian garrison period. The history of prostitution in Minden is so closely interwoven with the history of this street that the ramp hole has become a local synonym for prostitution. Etymology\nThe etymological origin of the name Rampenloch has not been conclusively clarified. One theory is the root word is a dialect term for tripe or chitterlings from cattle, indicating that in the 15th century the site was a local garbage heap or knackers yard. There is a similarly named Rampendahl in Lemgo. History\nArchitectural history\nThe corner house, 3 Rampenloch, dates from 1802 and has remained almost unchanged to this day. Built as a master bricklayer's house, it illustrates the living and housing conditions at the beginning of the 19th century and is included in the register of historic monuments.",

The pavement, laid in 1877, has been preserved. The paving, which is now unique in Minden, is also included in the register of historic monuments. It consists of basalt cobbles for the carriageway, sandstone curbs and clinker brick walkways. From 1908, several prostitutes have been recorded as house owners. After the eastern entrance to the Rampenloch was closed with a wall in around 1960, the street is now only accessible from the Königswall. Disreputable location\nThe Rampenloch, which used to lie outside the city limits, has always been considered a disreputable place that was avoided by the population. In the Middle Ages there was a cemetery for women who had been sentenced to death for child murder. Child murder was relatively widespread at the time, because of the stigmatisation and rejection by society of unmarried mothers. The death penalty was applied for infanticide. As the women were considered too dishonourable for a funeral in a conventional cemetery, they were buried outside the city, mostly in places that were already stigmatised and used for other disposals.",

A street which was a settlement for the poor had formed in the 16th century. Residents who were not allowed to live within the city walls due to poverty, illness or for the exercise of dishonourable professions had probably settled there. Minden as a garrison town\nOn November 13, 1806 Minden was occupied by French troops and incorporated into the French Kingdom of Westphalia, where it remained until 1813 when Napoleon I was defeated in the Battle of Minden. During the term of office of the first Minden district administrator in Arnim (1816 1820), the Minden fortress was rebuilt under the supervision of the government of the Minden district. Since Minden was a fortress city, there were a lot of soldiers stationed there, far from their families, which meant that prostitution flourished. Many of the women involved had no other way of making a living. The urban population had become impoverishment which was a consequence of the long occupation by the French, who had imposed economic and social restrictions and sanctions on the local population.",

Lack of education, broken family relationships and illegitimate origins were, according to contemporary statements, factors that made social advancement impossible at that time. Spread of sexually transmitted diseases\nThe dominant form of prostitution was street prostitution; there was no official brothel in the Minden fortress at that time. This became a serious problem for the army as venereal diseases spread. In autumn 1817, 15 soldiers in the Fusilier Battalion alone had contracted venereal diseases. The Minden fortress commander, Major General Ernst Michael von Schwichow, was commissioned with the redesign of Minden's defences. He was in charge of the resulting works, such as the rebuilding of the city fortress, which included the demolition of barracks and the quartering of troops. Since the control of hygiene and the supervision of troop's health also fell within his area of responsibility, his military doctors informed him about the increased infection rate with venereal diseases. Schwichow took the spread of the disease very seriously and soon identified uncontrolled prostitution as the main source of the infection.",

    "text": "Schwichow took the spread of the disease very seriously and soon identified uncontrolled prostitution as the main source of the infection. Unlike the common  moral  way of thinking at the time in dealing with sexuality and its consequences, Schwichow approached things more constructively. According to his theory, the only sensible way to stop the infections, or to bring them down to a tolerable level, was the official determination of the source of the infection - the prostitutes - and their healing, not just that of the soldiers and the city should bear the costs. On November 3, 1817, Schwichow's order was issued that every infected soldier must reveal the place and person by which they were infected:\nIf he cannot or does not want to indicate this, he should be courageous, but severely punished after recovery. A lawsuit against a prostitute caused a sensation in nearby Paderborn : On 13 June 1817, in the Paderborn Royal Higher Regional Court, a case was brought against the 17-year-old prostitute, Caroline Klütemeyer, for   corner prostitution  , and a day labourer, Wilhelm Heidemann, for tolerating a  whores economy  in his house (he rented a room for the prostitute to use). However, the court acquitted the accused because it believed that prostitution of  dissolute women  was not prohibited as long as it was done under the supervision of the state in the appropriate places.",

Since there was no officially permitted brothel in the Prussian Minden fortress, the Paderborn judgement was understood as an indication to work towards the targeted and controlled establishment of brothels. As a result, Schwichow appealed to the Royal Ministry of the Interior to have a brothel built in Minden, in which prostitutes should work under controlled conditions. The city should also pay for the costs. The request was granted because the Ministry of the Interior was also able to determine that in a garrison town like Minden, full of single soldiers, there was a need to regulate prostitution. Control of prostitution\nSince street prostitution was to be pushed as out of Minden as far as possible, a brothel should be assigned for the prostitutes. Schwichow arranged for the Minden city council to visit the registered prostitutes on 29 November and to give them a choice: either they continued to work with weekly health inspections, under which they would have to pay for their treatment in the event of a diagnosed illness, or they would be banned and punished. Another requirement was that married prostitutes had to present a permit from their husbands in order to continue working legally.",

    "text": "Another requirement was that married prostitutes had to present a permit from their husbands in order to continue working legally. The first brothel was initially a semi-official set-up, as finalising official regulation dragged on until 1823, due to resistance from the population and the district administrator maintaining that a city with under 10,000 inhabitants was too small to have a brothel operation. Finally, on 27 December 1823, the Ministry of the Interior approved an official brothel for soldiers - in view of the need to regulate prostitution in a garrison town. This approval was linked to ministerial criticism of the choice of words by the Minden authority, which Freudenhaus (pleasure house) had taken as the name for a brothel:\nIncidentally, I cannot approve of the term  Freudenhaus  used by the royal government, because bad things in themselves cannot and should not be ennobled by changing names, nor is the intended name appropriate because brothels are too often the source of long suffering and remorse. The first brothel after the city's decree was not at Rampenloch, contrary to the city legends of Minden, but at Heidemann House No. 575 and later Königswall 87, and these were used for prostitution between 1817 and 1846. After the innkeeper's death, the premises on Königswall closed in 1846.",

In the period that followed, the Minden brothel frequently changed its locations before prostitutes settled at the Rampenloch. There were also brothels at Deichhof and again at Königswall from 1900 to 1910, and also in Soodgasse and Weingarten. However, street prostitution only briefly decreased as a result of the brothels opening. The closure of the brothels was considered in 1839 1840. Military doctors claimed a significantly lower number of sexually ill patients since the brothel was built: 46 cases in four years. The regimental doctor of 15 Infantry Regiment attributed this on the one hand to the morality of some soldiers, but also referred to the opposite: When the unit was stationed in Wesel, where there were three  mean and cheap  brothels, 22 men were infected in three months. The Minden brothels remained, however, and moved into Rampenloch at the end of the 19th century, which was then considered a street of prostitution.",

Initially there was a non-fraternisation policy imposed on the soldiers. The War Office notably published that German women  will be willing, if they can get the chance, to make themselves cheap for what they can get out of you  in its handbook distributed to soldiers stationed in Germany. In spite of the ban, soldiers still knowingly had contact with local women. In a report by a British soldier formerly stationed in Germany:\n We drank in the Company club, sinking as much beer as we could and then in groups made for the perimeter wire of the barracks, avoiding the Provost staff led by Vic HOLE, the Provo Sgt in his black tracksuit. We then made our way into the town avoiding the Redcaps, and then settled in various bars in and near 'Rampenloch strass' until we could drink no more, then attempted to get into the Barracks (By a different route of course) to get an hours kip before Muster parade.",

Thousands of British soldiers were stationed in Minden, some of them in the Simeons barracks which was close to Rampenloch. Until their departure in 1994, British soldiers were the main income of the prostitutes in Rampenloch. At times the soldiers had to queue outside the brothels, some of them spending all of their pay in the street. Any trouble in the street from the soldiers was quickly dealt with by the military police. Some of the women from the street, suitably attired, were invited to the Officer's Mess at the barracks. A pupil of the Petershagen high school from 1950 to 1956 recalls his youthful memories of trips to Minden:\n    What a blast Minden was! That was the world, the big world with all the trimmings, especially the trimmings, the Rampenloch that they only spoke behind their hands, and what had been done there.

The last two of brothels closed in 2018 and the City of Minden purchased the properties. The city had previously brought other properties in the street as they became available, as part of the district's urban re-development. As two of the houses are listed and the paving of the street is also listed total redevelopment is not possible. The city's  Living action plan  of 2017, which includes a stock of housing, is expected to form an important basis for the scheme. An initial interest procedure started in January 2020 with concepts submitted to the city's urban planners. A specialist committee will select a preferred concept in November 2020. The successful applicant will then have a year to submit detailed proposals and costings for the full council for approval.

    "text": "Chemokines (from Ancient Greek χῠμείᾱ (khumeíā) 'alchemy' and κῑ νησῐς (kī nēsis) 'movement'), or chemotactic cytokines, are a family of small cytokines or signaling proteins secreted by cells that induce directional movement of leukocytes, as well as other cell types, including endothelial and epithelial cells. In addition to playing a major role in the activation of host immune responses, chemokines are important for biological processes, including morphogenesis and wound healing, as well as in the pathogenesis of diseases like cancers. Cytokine proteins are classified as chemokines according to behavior and structural characteristics. In addition to being known for mediating chemotaxis, chemokines are all approximately 8 10 kilodaltons in mass and have four cysteine residues in conserved locations that are key to forming their 3-dimensional shape. These proteins have historically been known under several other names including the SIS family of cytokines, SIG family of cytokines, SCY family of cytokines, Platelet factor-4 superfamily or intercrines.",

Some chemokines are considered pro-inflammatory and can be induced during an immune response to recruit cells of the immune system to a site of infection, while others are considered homeostatic and are involved in controlling the migration of cells during normal processes of tissue maintenance or development. Chemokines are found in all vertebrates, some viruses and some bacteria, but none have been found in other invertebrates. Chemokines have been classified into four main subfamilies: CXC, CC, CX3C and C. All of these proteins exert their biological effects by interacting with G protein-linked transmembrane receptors called chemokine receptors, that are selectively found on the surfaces of their target cells. Function\nThe major role of chemokines is to act as a chemoattractant to guide the migration of cells. Cells that are attracted by chemokines follow a signal of increasing chemokine concentration towards the source of the chemokine. Some chemokines control cells of the immune system during processes of immune surveillance, such as directing lymphocytes to the lymph nodes so they can screen for invasion of pathogens by interacting with antigen-presenting cells residing in these tissues.",

These are known as homeostatic chemokines and are produced and secreted without any need to stimulate their source cells. Some chemokines have roles in development; they promote angiogenesis (the growth of new blood vessels), or guide cells to tissues that provide specific signals critical for cellular maturation. Other chemokines are inflammatory and are released from a wide variety of cells in response to bacterial infection, viruses and agents that cause physical damage such as silica or the urate crystals that occur in gout. Their release is often stimulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1. Inflammatory chemokines function mainly as chemoattractants for leukocytes, recruiting monocytes, neutrophils and other effector cells from the blood to sites of infection or tissue damage. Certain inflammatory chemokines activate cells to initiate an immune response or promote wound healing. They are released by many different cell types and serve to guide cells of both innate immune system and adaptive immune system. Types by function\nChemokines are functionally divided into two groups:\nHomeostatic: are constitutively produced in certain tissues and are responsible for basal leukocyte migration.",

Examples are: CXCL-8, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL11, CXCL10. Homing\nThe main function of chemokines is to manage the migration of leukocytes (homing) in the respective anatomical locations in inflammatory and homeostatic processes. Basal: homeostatic chemokines are basal produced in the thymus and lymphoid tissues. Their homeostatic function in homing is best exemplified by the chemokines CCL19 and CCL21 (expressed within lymph nodes and on lymphatic endothelial cells) and their receptor CCR7 (expressed on cells destined for homing in cells to these organs).",

Intramolecular disulfide bonds typically join the first to third, and the second to fourth cysteine residues, numbered as they appear in the protein sequence of the chemokine. Typical chemokine proteins are produced as pro-peptides, beginning with a signal peptide of approximately 20 amino acids that gets cleaved from the active (mature) portion of the molecule during the process of its secretion from the cell. The first two cysteines, in a chemokine, are situated close together near the N-terminal end of the mature protein, with the third cysteine residing in the centre of the molecule and the fourth close to the C-terminal end.

Activation of G proteins, by chemokine receptors, causes the subsequent activation of an enzyme known as phospholipase C (PLC). PLC cleaves a molecule called phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) into two second messenger molecules known as Inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) that trigger intracellular signaling events; DAG activates another enzyme called protein kinase C (PKC), and IP3 triggers the release of calcium from intracellular stores. These events promote many signaling cascades (such as the MAP kinase pathway) that generate responses like chemotaxis, degranulation, release of superoxide anions and changes in the avidity of cell adhesion molecules called integrins within the cell harbouring the chemokine receptor.",

Life\nLehmann was born in Hamburg, but was raised in Berlin, where his father Gottfried Arnold Lehmann (1766 1819) had been working since 1800 as a copper engraver. In the hope of one day being able to take over the business of his hitherto childless uncle, he began an apprenticeship as a saddler in his uncle's workshop in Leer, East Frisia. He found contact with a conventicle of young men during these years and attended revivalist edification meetings held in various private homes. His notebook contains a number of names from the circle of friends and members of the Brethren church, including that of the Moravian Brethren preacher Jakob Friedrich Plessing.

Through his wife Maria Johanna Eleonora, née Eichner, whom he married on 26 October 1827, Lehmann became acquainted with the Moravian Brethren, whose worship life also made a great impression on him. He was active in various revivalist associations, including the Hauptverein für christliche Erbauungsschriften in den preußischen Staaten ('Main Association for Christian Edification Writings in the Prussian States'), founded by Samuel Elsner, and as secretary in the temperance association, led by Friedrich Wilhelm Georg Kranichfeld. During a trip to Leer in 1835, he met Johann Gerhard Oncken in Hamburg, who had just founded the first German Baptist congregation there. After intensive study of the Baptist understanding of baptism and congregationalism, he invited Oncken to Berlin in 1837 and was baptized by him there on Pentecost Sunday. With some of those also baptized by Oncken, he founded the first Prussian Baptist congregation in Berlin and became its pastor and elder.",

Together with pastor Eduard Kuntze, Lehmann led the founding of the German branch of the Evangelical Alliance in 1851. References\nFurther reading\nLuckey, Hans (1939).

Its first release was in 1997, originally called Nokia Data Suite. It was replaced by Nokia Suite and integrated into the Ovi service suite. Functionality\nNokia PC Suite can be used to transfer music, photos and applications. It can also be used to send Short Message Service (SMS) messages or act as a modem to connect the computer to the Internet. A mobile phone can be connected by USB, Bluetooth, or infrared. Some older Nokia phones lack compatibility with later versions of the PC Suite. The official site supplies a table that matches each phone model with the most recent compatible version. The latest version of Nokia PC Suite also contains several integrated applications, including the File Manager, Application Installer and  Nokia Communication Centre  data viewer. PC Suite users can also access on-device features (e.g. battery, memory and call handling), as well as Nokia PC Sync functionality. History\nSome of the earliest devices that worked with Nokia Data Suite were the Nokia 3110, Nokia 6110 and Nokia 8110. Nokia PC Suite has been unimproved, and was replaced by Nokia's next generation phone suite software, Nokia Suite, which supported other platforms in addition to Windows.",

He was a commoner of St. Edmund Hall, Oxford, and in 1635 rector of Hodnet and Ightfield. When he joined the king at Oxford in 1642, the Parliament garrison at Wem plundered his house so completely that (according to his own account) they left him neither bible, nor money, nor clothes. He was promoted to be Archdeacon of Lichfield and Coventry and prebendary of Woolvey. Resuming his activity in the royal service, his estate was sequestrated and he imprisoned until after the King's death. He was then exiled and took refuge at The Hague. Arnway was compelled by poverty to accept an invitation to exercise his function among the English in Virginia. There he died, it is supposed, in 1653. Works\nIn 1650, at The Hague, Arnway published two pamphlets:\nThe Tablet, a vindication of the king against John Milton's Eikonoklastes; and\nAn Alarum to the Subjects of England, an account of the oppressions which he and others had suffered.

The conflict was between Pan-Islamist, Salafi jihadist groups affiliated with Al-Qaeda, and Islamist groups made up of Iraqis which leaned more towards Iraqi nationalism and often disagreed with Al-Qaeda's ambitions. In early 2007, one of Iraq's main armed groups had confirmed a split with al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), according to a spokesman for the dissenting organisation. The Islamic Army, however, reached a ceasefire with AQI on 6 June 2007, yet still  refused to sign on to  the Islamic State of Iraq. Background\nThe initial split between the Islamic Army and Al-Qaeda in Iraq dated back to 2005, with some small reports of splits and even armed clashes. In the summer of 2006 increasing rifts began to open between local Sunni tribes and insurgent groups (including the Islamic Army), and al-Qaeda. The main focus of these rifts was dissatisfaction with Al-Qaeda and its tactics, particularly the heavy and deliberate targeting of civilians by foreign Al-Qaeda fighters. In September 2006, this growing anger led to the establishment of the Anbar Salvation Council by 30 tribes, who then sought US support in fighting Al-Qaeda in Anbar. Using the Al-Anbar Salvation Council as a model, CLCs were armed and trained by the U.S.",

Conflict\nEmergence of conflict\nActual fighting between the various groups had begun by early 2007, with groups fighting Al-Qaeda for control of their local communities. The fighting saw Al-Qaeda targeting groups critical of it, with Al-Qaeda bombing a Sunni mosque in Fallujah in February 2007, and assassinating the leader of the 1920 Revolution Brigade. February 2007 also saw Misha'an al-Juburi, who owns a television channel used as a propaganda channel by the IAI, attacking Al-Qaeda in Iraq, particularly over the group's attacks on civilians, rival insurgent groups, and the Iraqi security forces.",

Dari was the nephew of Harith al-Dari, the exiled head of the Muslim Scholars Association. The 1920 Revolution Brigades had allegedly been in talks over working with the Anbar Salvation Council. Dari had long been targeted by Al-Qaeda due to his refusal to pledge allegiance to the ISI Emir, Omar al-Baghdadi. Following Dari's death the Brigades announced its split into two factions the 1920 Revolution Brigades and Hamas of Iraq. The break was the result of differing viewpoints on working with the al-Anbar Salvation Council, negotiating with coalition forces and the relationship vis-à-vis Al-Qaeda's Islamic State of Iraq (ISI). In January 2018, an article was published in an Arabic magazine which claimed that al-Qaeda is working with Hezbollah to target these brigades once again. There has also been talk of using them as a training ground for future jihadists. Open conflict\nFighting magnified in the Spring of 2007.

In the face of escalating conflict, the Islamic Army called on Osama bin Laden to personally intervene to reign in al-Qaeda in Iraq. In May 2007 the Anbar Salvation Council claimed to have killed Abu Ayyub al-Masri, which was dispelled by an audio tape released by the group in response, which also denied claims of fighting between the various groups.

    "text": "During NASA's Space Shuttle program, several missions were canceled. Many were canceled as a result of the Challenger and the Columbia disasters or due to delays in the development of the shuttle. Others were canceled because of changes in payload and mission requirements. Canceled due to the late development of the Space Shuttle\nIn 1972, NASA's planners had projected 570 Space Shuttle missions between 1980 and 1991. Later, this estimate was lowered to 487 launches between 1980 and 1992. The details of the first 23 projected missions, listed in the third edition of Manned Spaceflight (Reginald Turnill, 1978) and the first edition of the STS Flight Assignment Baseline, an internal NASA document published in October 1977, are:\nLater in the development process, NASA suggested using the first crewed Space Shuttle mission, STS-1, as a sub-orbital test of the Return to Launch Site (RTLS) flight profile devised for an emergency abort. Columbia would have launched from Kennedy Space Center, then executed a 180-degree turn at a speed of 8,400 kilometres per hour (5,200 mph), or 6.7 times the speed of sound, in order to land at the Kennedy Space Center runway. The mission was canceled when astronauts refused to fly it, having deemed the plan to be too dangerous. STS-1 commander John W. Young recalled that  I said no.",

    "text": "South Carolina Highway 22 (SC 22), also known as the Conway Bypass and Veterans Highway, is a four lane freeway that connects US 501 north of Conway, South Carolina, to US 17 in Myrtle Beach. The road was opened to traffic on May 4, 2001, six months ahead of schedule. It is slated to become part of Interstate 73 in the future. The road largely meets Interstate Highway standards, but in order to support increased Interstate traffic, its shoulders would need to be expanded to standard width. Route Description\nHistory\nIn 1994, the original contract with Fluor Daniel called for six lanes from US 17 to SC 905 and four lanes the rest of the way to US 501. This money depended on a one-cent sales tax devoted to road funding, but voters turned that down. A bridge was built over the Intracoastal Waterway near Briarcliffe Acres, but it remained the  Bridge to Nowhere  for three years because there was no money to build the road. In February 1999, the South Carolina Senate passed a bill naming the bridge for Billy Alford, state highway commissioner from 1990 to 1994 and commission chair in 1993. On February 24, 1999, the South Carolina Department of Transportation Commission approved  95 million to make the bypass four lanes.",

    "text": "On February 24, 1999, the South Carolina Department of Transportation Commission approved  95 million to make the bypass four lanes. Two years earlier, since money was short, the bypass had been reduced to two lanes beyond SC 90, though the  291.3 million project had six lanes to SC 31. Even with the changes, the road would end up being cheaper than planned because of narrower shoulders and bridges, and more bridges over wetlands. On March 4, 1999, The Joint Bond Review Committee approved selling bonds for the money approved in February. Widening the bridges was considered, since some believed that the road could need six lanes in only a few years. In June 2000, the first section of the Conway Bypass opened 17 months sooner than expected despite flooding from Hurricane Floyd. In November 2000, the section from SC 90 to SC 905, including a 29-foot-high bridge over the Waccamaw River, opened 13 months sooner than planned. The final section opened with a ribbon cutting ceremony in May 2001. In 2003, the South Carolina General Assembly approved a resolution asking that the Conway Bypass be designated I-73.",

He is the former president and CEO of The Heartland Institute, an American nonprofit conservative and libertarian public policy think tank based in Arlington Heights, Illinois. He retired as president and CEO in July 2017 when former Congressman Tim Huelskamp took over those roles in the organization. Huelskamp was followed as president at Heartland by Frank Lasee in 2019, and then James Taylor in 2020. Biography\nBast was born on January 22, 1958, in Kimberly, Wisconsin, where he attended a Catholic elementary school. He studied economics at the University of Chicago but dropped out of school in order to devote more time to the Heartland Institute. Bast married Diane Bast, who grew up with him in Kimberly. In 1984, David Padden founded the Heartland Institute   an American conservative and libertarian public policy think tank   and put Bast in charge of the nascent organization. Bast has been president and CEO ever since. Personally, I'm a fallen-away libertarian. I place a high value on individual freedom and I tend to look at most issues from that perspective. But I'm not sure it is the only way anymore,  Bast told the Chicago Tribune in 1995.

Bast told Bloomberg News that the Heartland Institute does not deny climate change, but they are skeptical of the scientific consensus that man-made global warming is a significant danger to the planet. The Heartland Institute also believes that many of the policies to fight global warming would be damaging to the economy. According to Nature, Bast does not necessarily deny that humans are having an influence on the climate, but he does question the forecasts of catastrophic impacts and the rationale for curbing carbon emissions. Bast argues that the costs of trying to prevent global warming exceed the benefits. In a Wall Street Journal interview, Bast said that he believes the climate has warmed in the second half of the 20th century and there is likely a measurable human impact on climate. He believes the human impact on global warming is likely very small and that minimal warming is not a crisis. According to Bloomberg News, Bast's skepticism of the dangers posed by global warming have made him  a favorite bogeyman of environmentalists. In 2012, Bast signed off on a widely criticized ad campaign that compared global warming believers to the Unabomber.",

The football team was a department of the club which also offers its members American football, athletics, table tennis, and triathlon. History\nOnly a small local side, the footballers nonetheless played a half dozen seasons in the second division Regionalliga Nord through the early 1970s. They joined the newly formed 2. Bundesliga Nord for the 1974 75 season when a re-structured second division circuit was created from the best performing and most financially stable clubs of the era's five Regionalliga. A middling club at best in their old division, Wilhelmshaven finished 17th in the re-organized competition and was relegated to the tier III Amateur Oberliga Nord. In 1992 the sports clubs TSR Olympia Wilhelmshaven and SV Wilhelmshaven merged for economic reasons. Olympia's football department withdrew to play in the local city circuit. In 2000 the German Football Association (Deutscher Fussball Bund or German Football Association) refused a proposed re-union with what was now known as SV Wilhelmshaven 92 which was struggling financially.

His parents were Poppo, Count of Berg-Schelklingen, and his wife Sophia, who is sometimes claimed to be a Princess of Hungary   an otherwise unattested daughter of Solomon, King of Hungary and Judith of Swabia, but this is highly unlikely for chronological reasons. The historian Christoph Friedrich von Stälin theorised that their great political power despite humble origins was due to kinship with Bishop St. Otto of Bamberg, who was also Judith's chaplain after her marriage to Władysław I, Duke of Poland, with whom she had a daughter Adelaide, who married Henry's brother-in-law Diepold III, Margrave of Vohburg and gave birth to Adelaide of Vohburg, the first wife of Frederick Barbarossa. Henry married around 1090 to Adelaide of Mochental, daughter of Diepold II, Margrave of Vohburg and Liutgard of Carinthia. During the 1090s Henry and Adelaide had three sons and three daughters, who married highly influential nobles from the Houses Přemyslid of Bohemia and Piast of Poland. Henry retired during the 1100s and became a monk in Zwiefalten Abbey.",

By the late-1950s, he was regularly teaming with his brother Jackie Fargo and with their kayfabe brother Don Fargo as  The Fabulous Fargos  in the Tennessee-based NWA Mid-America promotion. In 1960, Sonny and Jackie made several appearances in Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York. In 1962, Fargo briefly held the East Coast Heavyweight Championship in the Massachusetts-based Santos Wrestling Enterprises promotion.",

In 1963, Fargo was brought into Championship Wrestling from Florida as  the Assassins' Valet , the silent masked henchman of the villainous tag team The Assassins. When The Assassins were being overwhelmed during matches, Fargo would revive them with an oxygen mask at ringside. On one occasion, Fargo legitimately stunned Eddie Graham by accidentally hitting him too hard with the oxygen tank. In early 1964, Fargo began wrestling under a mask as  the Masked Rebel . In March 1964, he and Jackie Fargo briefly held the NWA Southern Tag Team Championship (Mid-America version). He unmasked the following month. From 1964 to 1966, Fargo began regularly appearing with the Charlotte, North Carolina based Jim Crockett Promotions, where his regular opponents included Joe Tomasso. He made occasional further in-ring appearances with Jim Crockett Promotions throughout the late-1960s and early-1970s, but by the mid-1960s had largely transitioned to being a referee for the promotion.",

After being absent from NWA Mid-America for several years, from 1968 Fargo began sporadically reappearing under a new persona, taking time off from his refereeing job to wrestle for short stints in Tennessee. Nicknamed  Roughhouse  Fargo, he was portrayed as the mentally unstable brother of Jackie Fargo, with the storyline being that Jackie Fargo would check him out of a psychiatric hospital and bring him to the territory when he needed help dealing with heels. The brothers' rivals included The Bounty Hunters, The Garvin Brothers (Ronnie Garvin and Terry Garvin), The Interns, The Von Brauners, and The Bicenntenial Kings (Dennis Condrey and Phil Hickerson). To make his character seem legitimate, Fargo engaged in antics such as eating fans' popcorn, giving nonsensical promos, and attacking his opponents with unlikely weapons such as ice cream cones and ketchup bottles. From 1972 to 1974, Fargo held the NWA Southern Tag Team Championship (Mid-America version) four more times. As Roughhouse Fargo, he was a major draw in the Memphis area.",

    "text": "Exceller (May 12, 1973   April 7, 1997) is widely considered one of the best horses to race in the United States not to win a year-end championship. Despite his exemplary achievements as a racehorse, and his unique accomplishment in being the only horse to ever defeat two U.S. Triple Crown winners in the same race (and only the second ever to do so in his career), Exceller is now remembered more for the tragic manner of his death and the horse rescue movement it helped inspire. Background\nExceller was foaled on May 12, 1973 in Kentucky. Bred by Mrs. Charles W. Engelhard, he was sold as a yearling for approximately  27,000 to Nelson Bunker Hunt. Hunt's advisors figured that a son of European champion stayer Vaguely Noble with long and upright pasterns, would be better suited to European racing and sent him to France. European racing career\nTrained at first by François Mathet, who had been the trainer for François Dupré, and later by Maurice Zilber, Exceller didn't accomplish much racing as a two-year-old but blossomed as the distances got longer during his three-year-old season.",

Shipped to England at age four, he wound up a half-length behind The Minstrel and Orange Bay in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and won the Coronation Cup. Sent to Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Canada, Exceller won the Canadian International. American racing career\nIn the middle of 1977, Exceller was shipped to California and placed in the care of Charlie Whittingham. At first, Whittingham didn't have high expectations for a horse who walked stiffly on arrival and seemed the worse for wear. However, a little time off and some of Whittingham's expertise soon had Exceller competing and winning against some of the best horses in America. As a five-year-old in 1978, Exceller had his best season on the racecourse, winning 7 of 10 starts, all in top company, on both dirt and turf racetracks. After claiming the Hollywood Gold Cup, Hollywood Invitational Turf Handicap, San Juan Capistrano Handicap, Sunset Handicap, and Oak Tree Invitational Stakes, Exceller had his crowning moment.",

With Bill Shoemaker in the saddle, he came from 22 lengths back to beat Triple Crown winners Seattle Slew and Affirmed in the Jockey Club Gold Cup. Affirmed's saddle had slipped, effectively taking him out of the race, and Seattle Slew had hung up almost suicidal fractions on the lead, but Exceller still powered through the Belmont Park mud to win by a nose. Exceller came back again at age six and managed some placings, but was not quite the same horse. In sum, he had won 15 of 33 starts, including 13 stakes races, and placed in 11 more in France, England, Canada, and the United States and had earned  1,654,003. He and Noor were the only horses in history to defeat two U.S. Triple Crown winners, and Exceller was the only one to pull off this feat in a single race. Most racing writers agree that, along with Gallant Man and Lure, he may have been the best horse to race in the United States and not win a year-end championship. Exceller ran best, like many European horses,  covered up  deep in the pack early.",

In the late stages of the race he produced a powerful burst of speed and caught the leaders in the stretch. His final quarter mile times are notable because he regularly sprinted this distance in under 25 seconds. His fractions of 23 2 5 seconds at the end of the Hollywood Gold Cup and Oak Tree Invitational is very fast, as 23 seconds is considered a quick first quarter in such a race. Stud career\nExceller was syndicated and retired to stud at Gainesway Farm in Lexington, Kentucky for the 1980 breeding season. He shared a small stallion barn with his sire Vaguely Noble and classic-winning champion stablemate, Youth. In 1986 (and probably before), he stood for a  50,000 stud fee, the second-highest listed fee at Gainesway at the time. As time went on, however, it became obvious that Exceller was never going to be a leading sire. By 1991, his stud fee had plummeted to  2,500. Death\nIn 1991, the syndicate was bought out by a breeder from Sweden and Exceller was shipped back across the Atlantic Ocean. He sired a few crops of foals, then was diagnosed with a mysterious infection that forced his removal from stud service for several years.",

When Exceller's owner went bankrupt, the horse was moved to a small farm where he remained for a year before owner Göte Östlund ordered him killed. He was taken to a slaughterhouse and killed for meat on April 7, 1997. According to the woman who tended him- and whose duty it became to kill him- and the Scandinavian Racing Bureau, he wasn't destroyed due to illness or injury, but because he became a liability to his bankrupt owner Göte Östlund. Legacy\nExceller left behind 16 crops of foals in the United States, including 19 stakes winners and 40 stakes horses, none of them of his quality. His runners were headed by the fillies Slew's Exceller and Squan Song. Exceller was elected to the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1999. Although the museum's website mentions the manner of his death, his plaque in the museum does not, stating only that he died in 1997. His fate, essentially unheard of for an American stallion of his racing class, generated debate over the proper treatment of race horses after their careers on the track were over.",

Today, a number of grassroots organizations, such as The Exceller Fund, ReRun, The Communication Alliance to Network Thoroughbred Ex-Racehorses (CANTER), and Old Friends, among others, take inspiration from Exceller's story as they work to purchase and retrain former racehorses for new careers. In addition, had the horse been in the United States, he may well have been given a proper home at the Kentucky Horse Park's Hall of Champions in Lexington as was done after the retired champion thoroughbred Cigar was found to be infertile at stud. Or, the owner might have been able to have handed him over to the Thoroughbred Retirement Foundation in Shrewsbury, New Jersey, the world's largest and most respected organization devoted to equine rescue. Like Exceller, Kentucky Derby winner Ferdinand ended up in a slaughterhouse in Japan in 2002. In the Blood-Horse magazine ranking of the top 100 U.S. thoroughbred champions of the 20th century, Exceller was ranked  96. Pedigree\n   References",

    "text": "Lady Detective, published in English as Lizzie Newton: Victorian Mysteries, is a Korean manhwa series, written by Hey-jin Jeon and drawn by Ki-ha Lee. It began serialization in 2011 in Daiwon C.I. Issue manhwa magazine. The series revolves around the title character, a young woman from Victorian England who works as a mystery author, who also solves real-life mysteries and crimes. The series is set in the same fictional universe as the Sherlock Holmes stories, but in an earlier period, so Holmes is still a boy, and other Holmes characters appear as younger versions of themselves in the story. Plot\nSet in London in 1864, the stories centre on the adventures of Elizabeth  Lizzie  Newton. She works as an author, writing the popular mystery series McMorning, Private Tutor and Sleuth for Gentlemen's Own magazine under the male pseudonym of Logica Docens. Other than writing, her passions are collecting books (extending the library of her late father) and conducting chemical experiments. Her close friends and family however, believe that she would better off settling down and marrying her long-term fiancé Edwin White. White works as steward to Lizzie to be closer to her, but before doing so he was a master barrister, nicknamed  The White Devil of the Courtroom .",

The series revolves around Lizzie and Edwin, as they come into contact with various crimes and mysteries during their work, and try to solve the cases. Much of the drama in the series involves other characters, usually male, and their sexist treatment toward Lizzie. Amongst these characters include Inspector Charles B.

Setting\nLizzie Newton: Victorian Mysteries is set in the same universe as the Sherlock Holmes stories, but in the year 1864, at which point, Jeon writes:  Holmes is still just a boy here because this story takes place seventeen years before Holmes and Watson would live together on Baker Street. Several Sherlock Holmes characters make appearances in the series as younger versions of themselves.

Heart of Manga have the series a four out of five rating saying:  Mystery and romance, attractive artwork, and well developed characters make this volume a highly entertaining read , and,  While the mystery in the first volume is a rather simple one, Lizzie and Edwin are able to prove the case using scientific evidence. Ian Wolf, writing for the British MyM magazine gave a mixed review writing that,  It could be argued that the story is rich in clichés , and,  The dialogue is a bit odd in places , but also that,  The art is rather good though. Brigid Alverson for MTV Geek gave a mixed review to the first volume writing:  The story is set in 1864 among the British upper crust, and it makes the most of both the period setting and Victorian attitudes toward women. In fact, it leans way too hard on those attitudes, presenting Lizzie as a smart, independent woman who spends so much time fuming at her sexist contemporaries that it takes away from the story at hand. ...

A review of the series for the Anime News Network by Rebecca Silverman gave it an  A   grading, but wrote critically about the use of clothing in the first volume saying:  Ki-ha Lee's artwork fits almost seamlessly into the world that Hey-jin Jeon evokes. Backgrounds and buildings look appropriately Victorian, albeit sans the plethora of knickknacks popular at the time. (But what a pain to draw, yes?) Clothing has a little more trouble. While Lizzie and the other upper class ladies wear the bell-shaped skirt popular at the time, lady's maid Jane's clothing is from the 1890s. With the skirt widths being so drastically different between the two decades, this is distracting. On the plus side, Lizzie moves as if she is wearing a corset, never bending from the waist and even crouching with her knees out to the sides. Another nice touch is that Lee occasionally uses portraits and photos from the Victorian era when discussing people or developments from history, reminding us that this story takes place in the real world rather than a facsimile thereof.

The sequel to Runaway: A Road Adventure, it follows protagonists Brian Basco and Gina Timmins as their vacation in Hawaii goes awry, sweeping up the two of them into a secret project by the United States military. The player controls Brian and explores the game world while collecting items, solving puzzles and interacting with non-player characters. The game had begun preproduction at Pendulo Studios by early 2003. Runaway was a commercial hit for the company and saved it from bankruptcy, and Pendulo rehired much of its lost staff for the sequel. New employee Josué Monchan wrote the game in collaboration with project lead Ramón Hernáez. The project's scope grew ambitious and it was beset by numerous delays. It first launched in France in fall 2006. Originally a computer game, Runaway 2 was later ported to iOS, the Nintendo DS and the Wii. Runaway 2 received mixed reviews upon release, the worst for a Pendulo title at the time. Monchan later called it the studio's worst-ever game, and said that the team heavily revised its development process for the third Runaway game, Runaway: A Twist of Fate (2009).",

He learns that Sushi had gone to Palenque while he was unconscious, only to find that the Trantonite had been stolen centuries before by a pirate named Malantùnez, who had subsequently disappeared. Sushi and her friends help Brian locate Malantùnez's shipwreck and dive for the Trantonite, but he is knocked unconscious by a falling timber underwater. He dreams that he is a captive named  Brushian  aboard Malantùnez's ship. Characters from throughout the game and Runaway: A Road Adventure appear in new guises, and Brian eventually locates the Trantonite. After waking up on Sushi's yacht, rescued by a crewmember, Brian knows the Trantonite's location and obtains it on his next dive.",

The crew prepares to return to Mala Island, deliver the Trantonite to the Trantorians and rescue Gina. Having survived Tarantula's attack, Professor Simon reappears and promises to help. The game ends on a cliffhanger as the crew approaches Mala Island. Development\nFollowing the international launch of Runaway: A Road Adventure, Pendulo Studios began to plan a sequel. The team had spent a year in a legal battle for Runaway's rights with Dinamic Multimedia, its bankrupt publisher, during which Pendulo had laid off almost its entire staff. After procuring the rights in mid-2002, the team had launched Runaway worldwide to great success, and Pendulo's Rafael Latiegui said that the team  wanted to immediately get  into  a video game  again. He noted that a sequel was the  quickest way  because of the groundwork already laid: Runaway had not been developed with a sequel in mind, but a large number of unused ideas nevertheless remained after the first game's release. In January 2003, PC Games reported that Runaway 2 was under consideration and had been partly storyboarded, but that it was not yet greenlit.",

According to Latiegui, Pendulo was waiting for the rest of the game's global returns before committing to a new title. The first game's commercial performance, combined with the team's desire to explore Runaway further, ultimately became a key inspiration to greenlight a sequel. Runaway 2 was first announced by DTP Entertainment in August 2003, at the Games Convention in Leipzig. By that time, the game had passed the initial concepting phase and its plot was finished. Runaway 2's subtitle was revealed as The Dream of the Turtle in October 2004. For Runaway 2, Pendulo rehired the  vast majority  of those laid off due to the Dinamic turmoil, according to Rafael Latiegui. Discussing Brian's change in appearance and personality in Runaway 2, Latiegui said that the team intended him to lose control of his life following the events of Runaway. The team had considered early in the process that Brian might discover himself to be gay in Runaway 2, according to Ramón Hernáez, to create a situation  such that he does not really know who he is anymore. Latiegui said of the final story in Runaway 2:  He very much tries to prove himself with his  new  look.",

He has gained a more realistic view of the world but, deep down, he is not a very commendable person. In the first game, Brian had a lot of principles and he lost a lot along the way. Hinting in 2007 at the story of Runaway 2's potential sequel, Latiegui said that  we will probably soon see a Brian who may have changed too quickly and he doesn't feel comfortable with himself. Pendulo opted to use an upgraded version of the same game engine from the first title, which had itself used an upgrade of the Hollywood Monsters engine. The project was initially scheduled for late 2004. Because of Runaway's high profits, Pendulo was able to put its own money into Runaway 2, although most of the game's funding was derived from French investments. The company held a contest to add the likeness of a player of Runaway to Runaway 2 as a character, resulting in Camille, based on a French fan. Runaway 2 underwent numerous delays, first to mid-2005 and then to late 2005, spring 2006 and September 2006. Discussing these setbacks at the time, Latiegui argued that it was  important for the quality of development  to take precedence over deadlines.",

However, the game returned to  9 on the charts during the week ending December 24. Combined sales of Runaway 2 and its predecessor had reached 250,000 units in France alone by April 2009. Runaway 2's computer version received a  Gold  certification from the Asociación Española de Distribuidores y Editores de Software de Entretenimiento (aDeSe), for sales of at least 40,000 units in Spain. Worldwide, Runaway 2 and its predecessor together sold one million copies by April 2009.

Legacy\nIn retrospect, Pendulo's Josué Monchan called Runaway 2  a horrible game  and  the biggest shit we've ever made . He cited his own dialogue writing as a key flaw, as  comedy is rhythm and  he  had no rhythm. In 2019, Monchan stated that he still occasionally returned to Runaway 2's dialogue to learn from his mistakes. He noted that the entire team learned from Runaway 2's poor reception to take feedback into greater consideration for its future titles, which influenced the design of the next Runaway entry. A third Runaway had been considered during Runaway 2's creation, and Pendulo unofficially confirmed that it was under development in November 2006. It received an official announcement at Games Convention in August 2007; certain outlets initially reported that Runaway 3 would be set in Japan and would take place immediately after its predecessor.

Pendulo and publisher Focus Home Interactive hoped to attract series newcomers with the numberless title, and Jeux Video reported that the game was  not the direct follow-up  to Runaway 2, but a relatively standalone project. Monchan said that Pendulo  rethought everything  about adventure game development as it created the game, in hopes of avoiding the mistakes of Runaway 2. A new engine was adopted for A Twist of Fate that offered improved graphics, although the game retained a pre-rendered 2D visual style. A Twist of Fate tells the story of Brian's attempt to escape from an insane asylum, where he is detained due to a murder accusation against him. Unlike the first two Runaway entries, the game features Gina as a playable character alongside Brian. A Twist of Fate was first released internationally in November 2009; its Spanish version, again delayed, launched in early 2010. Pendulo opted to temporarily retire the Runaway franchise after A Twist of Fate, although the team retained ideas for potential sequels.

A staunch nationalist, he contributed financially to the Home Rule League and after the split in 1890, he remained a supporter of Charles Stewart Parnell. He was elected Lord Mayor of Dublin in 1891, and re-elected the following year   his princely hospitality in the Mansion House was apparently responsible for his popularity. In the 1892 general election he stood as an Irish National League candidate for Stephen's Green constituency and was narrowly defeated by 15 votes by the liberal unionist William Kenny.

At Meade's death, his property   the bulk of which was in tenements   was valued at  60,000. Nine tenement houses which he owned in Henrietta Street were then auctioned; (including 14 Henrietta Street) these alone had provided him with a gross annual rental of  1,500. In twentieth-century history books he is chiefly remembered as a notorious slum landlord and despoiler of Georgian Dublin; he stripped out original features in the houses he owned and subdivided them. However, he enjoyed a good reputation during his lifetime; his obituaries testify to his geniality, his common sense, and his ability to make friends across the political divide. References",

History and present role\nTensions had long existed between Abkhaz nationalists and ethnic Georgians under Soviet rule, leading to the 1989 Sukhumi riots. In the aftermath of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Abkhazia remained as part of newly-independent Georgia. Tensions over autonomy demands led to the Abkhazian government proclaiming the independence of the region on 23 July 1992.

As Georgian forces recaptured Ochamchire, the tug was seized and incorporated into the Georgian Navy.

Trauth, in his capacity as president of the Herpetologist's League, stated that Sever's research contributions were why he was chosen. Early in his studies, Dave's histological research focused primarily on salamander cloacal anatomy and, specifically, the spermatheca or sperm storage structure in these animals,  said Trauth. His numerous papers on these structures have dominated the international literature on this subject for decades,  and  I consider Dave to be today's world leading authority on vertebrate reproductive histology .

Group members Taylor Momsen and Ben Phillips co-wrote the song and co-produced it with Jonathan Wyman. And So It Went  was released January 8, 2021 as the second single from the album. Critical reception\nMike DeWald of Riff Magazine cited the song as  one of the album's best moments,  praising the grunge influence and Morello's guitar solo. Emily Carter of Kerrang! was similarly complementary towards the solo, writing that   the  guitar hero leaves an almighty impact with his riffing. Commercial performance\n And So It Went  reached number one on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart, becoming the group's sixth song to top that chart and extending the band's record for the female-fronted group with the most number ones. The song also became the group's fifth top-ten on the Canada Rock chart, peaking at number five.

History\nThe first international rugby league in Spain was played in the region of Catalonia in 2009, with a Catalonia national rugby league team playing several matches against European nations. However, desiring to represent only Catalonia and not the entirety of Spain, the Catalonia team was denied RLEF membership and disappeared from international competition shortly afterwards. Rugby league in Spain began once again in 2013, with a national body (Asociación Española de Rugby League) being formed and admitted to the RLEF by the end of that year. The first Spanish domestic competition kicked off in 2013 with clubs based in the Valencian Community, and the national team played its first match on May 25, 2014, defeating Belgium in Brussels. The first captain was Aitor Davila and the first Spanish try at international level was scored by Gonzalo Morro. 2017 Rugby League World Cup\nQualifying\nOn 9 May 2015, Spain and Latvia kicked off proceedings for the qualifying fixtures for the 2017 Rugby League World Cup qualifying.

    "text": "Zvi Hirsch Bernstein (Yiddish: צבי הירש בערענשטין; March 25, 1846   August 6, 1907) was a Russian-American editor and publisher. He was the founder of the first Yiddish and the first Hebrew periodicals in the United States. Biography\nHirsch Bernstein was born in Vladislavov (Neustadt-Schirwindt), then part of the Russian Empire. He received a traditional Jewish education and became fluent in written Hebrew. He emigrated to the United States in 1870, settling in New York City. That same year, he launched Di Post, the first Yiddish-language periodical in the United States, using Yiddish type imported from Vilna and Vienna. The publication lasted only six months. Also in 1870, Bernstein founded Ha-Tzofeh be-Eretz ha-Ḥadashah ('The Observer in the New Land'), the first Hebrew-language publication in the United States, which was published weekly for five years. Bernstein was a frequent contributor to prominent European Hebrew periodicals such as Ha-Maggid, Ha-Lebanon, and Ha-Karmel. Alongside Ch. G. Vidaver, he was among the earliest regular American correspondents to these publications. Bernstein later became a successful businessman in New York and a patron of the Yiddish theatre.",

He is Emeritus Professor of Anthropology at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in Marseille. He is also Emeritus Director of Research at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in Paris and associate professor at Abdou Moumouni University in Niamey where he founded the master of socio-anthropology of health. Background\nOlivier de Sardan was born in Languedoc on July 11, 1941. He studied political science and anthropology in France during the late 1950s, gaining a Diploma at the Institut d Études Politiques de Paris (Sciences Po, 1961), Licence in Sociology from the Sorbonne (1963), and in 1967 his PhD (Doctorat de 3e cycle) in anthropology (ethnologie) supervised by R. Bastide. His Doctorat d état was directed by Jean Rouch, the jury being chaired by Georges Balandier, and awarded in 1982. He was a leading activist against the Vietnam War, and participated in the May 1968 demonstrations in France. For his doctoral work, he studied social change among the Wogo people in Niger, after first being recruited by Jean Rouch to conduct fieldwork with this group over a year in 1965.",

Over time his close observations of the Songhay-Zarma people have informed other projects, on more general topics, but all grounded in empirical researches in Africa: anthropology of development, medical anthropology, anthropology of bureaucracies, and, more generally, an anthropology of public actions and of the delivery of public and collective goods and services in Africa. He was a pioneer in the use of the anthropological method for the study of public policy and development aid in Africa. Known as an unconventional anthropologist, he had many collaborations with sociologists, historians or political scientists, and has produced innovative concepts such as  local modes of governance  and  practical norms . He helped found, and was first President of, APAD - the Association Euro-Africaine pour l Anthropologie du Changement social et du Développement and its journal. He established LASDEL in Niamey (Laboratoire d études et de recherches sur les dynamiques sociales et le développement local). He obtained citizenship of Niger in 1999.

    "text": "Research contributions\nOlivier de Sardan's first fieldwork was a classic anthropological investigation of a particular society, the Wogo along the banks and islands of the Niger River in Western Niger. Several later books describe the language and culture of the broader Songhay-Zarma populations of this region, including their therapeutic practices and former slavery relations. He and the visual anthropologist Jean Rouch are probably the foremost ethnographers of western Niger. Olivier de Sardan has also made significant contributions to the understanding of social change and development on African societies, through empirical observation in Niger, Benin, Mali and other countries in Africa (but also including the Lozère region in France). After fifteen years he moved away from classic ethnographic description of small scale society to observe how modernity and western influences are incorporated into, and subverted by, African societies - particularly through public and collective services delivery, and by development aid. In his 1995 book (Olivier de Sardan, 1995, English version 2005) he significantly enhanced the field of anthropology of development, advocating for a  fundamental  and non-normative anthropology of development (and not only an  applied  one), being attentive to the drifts, unintended effects and implementations gaps of development projects, describing the various perceptions and logics of development 'actors' and stakeholders in Africa and how they related to existing socio-political structures.",

More recent work concern local powers and decentralization in the context of stratified societies in Africa (Olivier de Sardan and Tidjani Alou, 2009), political corruption among state actors in cash-starved African contexts (Blundo and Olivier de Sardan, 2006) and the ethnography of elections (Olivier de Sardan, 2015). He has also contributed to insert medical anthropology into health policy and system research (HPSR), analyzing health service delivery in West Africa and the interactions between patients and health workers (Jaffré and Olivier de Sardan 2003), and developing an empirical approach of public health policies in Sahelian countries (Olivier de Sardan   Ridde, 2015).

    "text": "His latest work focuses on African public policies and administrations. He is particularly interested in  traveling models  (standardized health and development policies) and their confrontation with local contexts ( pragmatic contexts ), a major aspect of which is the  practical norms  that regulate the  non-observant behaviors  of civil servants, i.e. informal regulations of routine practices that deviate from official norms (De Herdt and Olivier de Sardan, 2015; Olivier de Sardan and Piccoli, 2018). It is also within this framework that he co-edited with Bierschenk a book on  States at work . Based on these various works and more generally on the results of the last twenty years of research in Niger and West Africa, he published a major work in 2021:  La revanche des contextes  (The revenge of contexts), which analyses in depth the unexpected effects of interventions (carried out to change behaviour and organizations) when confronted with the local contexts in which they are implemented, the complexity of the practical norms of field agents, the diversity of modes of governance that deliver services of general interest, or the tangle of social logics that underlie the practices of actors.

    "text": "The Socialist Party of Northern Ireland, sometimes known as the Northern Ireland Socialist Party, was a small socialist group based in Northern Ireland in the 1930s. Early years\nThe group originated in Belfast in 1892 as the Belfast Labour Party (BLP), founded by activists including William Walker and John Murphy. It became a branch of the British-based Independent Labour Party (ILP) when that organisation was founded in 1893. Later in the year, the British Trades Union Congress held its annual conference in Belfast, and an ILP fringe meeting was addressed by speakers including Keir Hardie, greatly increasing local party membership. The local group opposed Irish Home Rule, but were widely attacked by hardline unionists, and as a result largely ceased activities in 1896. However, Walker and Murphy continued to work together and hold membership of the ILP. The ILP in Belfast was revived in 1906, when new branches were formed in North and Central Belfast, and it quickly grew to have five branches. Walker remained its leading figure, while William McMullen also became a prominent activist. James Connolly aimed to win these branches to his own Socialist Party of Ireland (SPI), and he called a unity conference in Dublin in 1912, attended by four of the Belfast ILP groups (the exception being Walker's North Belfast branch).",

The branches united with the SPI and the Belfast branch of the British Socialist Party to form the  Independent Labour Party of Ireland , although this collapsed soon after the outbreak of World War I, after Connolly was banned from giving speeches alleged to be pro-German in Belfast by the local leadership of the group. However, the Belfast groups were split in their attitudes to Home Rule, the North Belfast branch being the largest and most strongly loyalist, the Central branch being close to the British Labour Party, and the East Belfast branch remaining supportive of Connolly's republican nationalism. Northern Ireland Labour Party\nThe ILP worked closely with the BLP. When the BLP became the Northern Ireland Labour Party (NILP), most ILP members in the city joined, while retaining their ILP membership. This continued until 1932, when the ILP disaffiliated from the British Labour Party. The national leadership wished the Belfast branches to similarly disaffiliate from the NILP, but members rejected the idea, and instead split from the ILP to form the Socialist Party of Northern Ireland. This new body then affiliated to the NILP. The Socialist Party had around 150 members, and was chaired by Fred McMahon, and later by Sam Haslett.",

Other notable members included Jack Macgougan, secretary from 1935 onwards, and Victor Halley. The ILP was based on the Crumlin Road, until its building was burnt down in the 1920s in a presumed sectarian attack. It received a large sum in compensation, and used part of this to open a new Labour Hall at 48 York Street, which also housed a social club for members. The party was very active in supporting the Republicans during the Spanish Civil War, and McMahon went over to join a medical unit there, alongside Joe Boyd, another Socialist Party member. In 1937, the party backed the short-lived Irish Democrat newspaper, co-published with the Communist Party of Ireland and the Republican Congress. The party disappeared soon afterwards; many members, including Macgougan, devoted their time to the NILP, but Halley instead joined the Socialist Republican Party. References",

In 1976, he completed the New York City Marathon, becoming the first runner to complete such an event with a prosthetic leg after being the first at shorter distances. He also collaborated with Marathon founder Fred Lebow in drawing more disabled athletes into the marathon. In the 1980s he became the first amputee to finish a 100 km ultra event, in Poland. In 1993, Traum wrote A Victory for Humanity. Recognition\nIn 2010, Traum was inducted into the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame. The Achilles Track Club was renamed Achilles International in 2004. Dick remained the CEO for 37-years before retiring in 2019. He was inducted to the NYRR Hall of Fame in 2018. As of 2019, he'd run the marathon distance more than seventy times and was the oldest athlete from New York City to run that year's Boston Marathon.

To translate the word varṇa as a letter is erroneous, because a letter is defined as a written or printed symbol employed to represent a speech-sound. The phonemes, having arisen from Nārāyaṇa, are eternal whereas the letters used to represent them may vary. For example, before the introduction of printing into India in the eighteenth century, the script in which Sanskrit was written and taught varied from place to place and was the same, or almost the same as that used in writing the local vernacular language. The dissemination of printed Sanskrit texts, however, encouraged the predominance of one form of writing, the Devanāgarī script of central India in which the modern languages Hindī and Marāṭhī are also written. Today most Sanskrit publications are printed in this  null script  BE1  .

Thus the varëa ka refers to k, the varëa kha to kh, and so on. One should not be confused by the various labels such as  the varëa ka,  ka-räma, ka-kära, and k; they all refer to the same consonant k, never to k a. This is the case for all the varëas from ka to ha. One should also be careful not to mistake kh, gh, ch, and so on, to be a combination of k h, g h, c h, and so on, because in roman transliteration the h in kh and so on is employed merely to indicate that the varëa is an aspirated consonant. It is impossible for kh and so on to be conjunct consonants since in Sanskrit there are no conjunct consonants that have h as their second member. The varëas from a to au, the vowels of the Sanskrit alphabet, are written differently when they come after a consonant. A, however, has no post-consonantal symbol and is assumed to come after every consonant unless there is another vowel or a viräma in its place.",

It was founded in 1911 and acquired the existing Biochemical Journal the following year. The society additionally publishes the journals Clinical Science and Biochemical Society Transactions via its publishing arm, Portland Press. It awards the Colworth Medal and formerly awarded the CIBA Medal (Novartis Medal). As of 2024, the president is Julia Goodfellow. Structure\nAs of December 2023, the society had over 4,500 members, mainly in the UK. It is affiliated with the European body, Federation of European Biochemical Societies (FEBS). The president has been Julia Goodfellow since 2022. The Society's headquarters are in London. History\nThe society was founded in 1911, under the name of the Biochemical Club. An informal preliminary meeting on 21 January 1911 at University College, London was organised by John Addyman Gardner and R. H. A. Plimmer and attended by 32 people. The first meeting was on 4 March 1911, with 38 members present; an initial decision to exclude women was rescinded the following year. The first committee consisted of Plimmer (honorary treasurer and secretary), Gardner, H. E. Armstrong, W. M. Bayliss, A. J. Brown, H. H.",

The name formally changed to the Biochemical Society in 1913, with Hopkins being appointed the first chair. Gardner took over as treasurer, remaining in the post until 1944, and was responsible for steering the society's finances through the First World War. The three earliest women members, elected in 1913, were Ida Smedley, who became the first female chair of the society, Harriette Chick and Muriel Wheldale.

Membership had risen to over a thousand by 1944, and that year the society proposed the Biological Council, which formed an umbrella organisation for the Anatomical Society, Linnean Society, Pathological Society, Physiological Society and the Society for Experimental Biology. In 1949, the society organised the first International Congress of Biochemistry, in Cambridge, before the foundation of the International Union of Biochemistry in 1955. Plimmer was the society's first historian; his 1949 history is described by the American science historian Robert E. Kohler as an  important primary document  for the early history of biochemistry in the UK, and in particular for why the society's founding members chose to separate from the older Physiological Society. An updated history was published in 1969 by Richard A. Morton. By the late 1960s, according to science historian Pnina Abir-Am, the society had established itself as a  well-organized nationwide power base for biochemists , and a  powerful  body whose activities went beyond the usual ones of a learned society to encompass  guarding the professional status, even welfare, of its members .",

Kendrew. The report proposes using the term  biochemistry  as a shorthand to include molecular biology as well as biophysics. That year the society celebrated its 500th meeting, at which Kendrew was among the speakers. According to the former CEO Chris Kirk (in 2011), membership peaked in the mid-1990s at around nine thousand, and had since fallen. The society's first permanent headquarters were at 7 Warwick Court in Holborn, purchased in 1966. In 1990, the headquarters of the society moved to Portland Place, and in 2005, to modern offices in Procter Street, Holborn. In 2009, the headquarters moved again to Charles Darwin House, Roger Street, sharing premises with the Society for Experimental Biology, British Ecological Society and the Royal Society of Biology.

An ortholog of NOTO is found in the house mouse (Mus musculus), among other species, as the gene notochord homeobox (Noto) located on chromosome 6, which encodes the homologous transcription factor homeobox protein notochord (Noto). In the house mouse, Noto is expressed in cells comprising the primitive node (node) of the developing embryo and functions to define the shape of the primitive node, help develop the lateral (left-right) asymmetry of the embryo, and form cilia primarily on posterior nodal cells. Noto is also essential for the proper development of the caudal notochord. Noto acts downstream of the genes Foxa2 and T, and its expression is absent in embryos with mutant forms of Foxa2 and T. However, a direct relationship for the regulation of Noto expression by Foxa2 and T has not yet been confirmed. In contrast, Noto acts upstream of Foxj1 and Rfx3, which both function in the ciliogenesis of certain other mouse tissues.",

Mouse embryos with mutant forms of Noto have been characterized by shortened nodal cilia, basal bodies deeply embedded in the cell cytoplasm, and or an abnormally-developed caudal notochord (complete absence in some cases). In one experiment, replacing Noto with Foxj1 resulted in functional nodal cilia, but only with Noto expression were cilia localized on posterior nodal cells and the normal shape of the node established. Additionally, Noto mutant embryos are subject to randomization of lateral asymmetry and are therefore often characterized by isomerization of the lungs, malformation of the cardiac outflow tract, heterotaxia, and or situs inversus.

Career\nHe recorded with The Medallions on Dootone, with the Four Dots on Freedom, and then with singer Eddie Daniels as  Jewel and Eddie  on the Silver Records label in 1960. A number of his recordings featured Eddie Cochran on guitar. He later went solo and recorded  The Birds and the Bees  in 1964, on the Era Records label. The single went to Number 3 in the Billboard Hot 100 chart that year, and Number 2 on the Cash Box chart, and was Number 2 for four weeks on Canada's CHUM Chart, kept out of Number 1 by the Beatles and Herman's Hermits. It reached Number 29 in the UK Singles Chart. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. But the follow-up,  Georgie Porgie  only reached Number 68. Akens toured regularly since 1965 and included a tribute to his mentor, Sam Cooke, in most of his shows. He also fronted a group billing itself as The Coasters, though it featured no actual original members of the group. Akens considered his cover versions of  Little Bitty Pretty One  by Thurston Harris and  You Better Move On  by Arthur Alexander to be his best work.",

Career\nSantiago Gallo and his brother Delfin Gallo grew up in San Miguel de Tucumán and belonged to the Tucumán oligarchy. Unlike his brother, his activities were concentrated in the sugar industry. He was in charge of two mills in Tucumán, Lujan and El Colmenar, and one in Santiago del Estero, the Contreras mill. Political controversy\nSantiago Gallo became Governor of Tucumán on October 12, 1884, as a successor of Benjamin Paz. As he was an opponent of Miguel Juárez Celman he was prevented from taking office. His enemies turned to the recent Tucumán Constitution, whose Article 13 said that the current governor would fulfill his term to the end, but the successor should conform to the new Constitution. As it concerned Benjamin Paz, who was a few days from demitting office when the constitution was passed, he was entitled to three years in office. As it related to Galló he would only serve two years. The question was settled by the Permanent Electoral College and ruled that the governor should remain for three years. However, the opposition asked for the Federal Congress  intervention.",

    "text": "Eriogonum nudum is a perennial shrub of the wild buckwheat genus which is known by the common name naked buckwheat or nude buckwheat. Description\nThe Eriogonum nudum plant is a tall, bare, leafless stem, bifurcating into more stems, each topped with rounded clusters of white or pale pink or yellow flowers growing up to six feet from a basal rosette at the ground, where the flat green leaves are located. An striking characteristic is that flower clusters typically occur at the branch as well as the branch tips. The naked stem gives the plant its common name. Distribution\nNaked buckwheat can be found scattered around the west coast of the United States. This species has one of the widest ecological distributions of all of the buckwheats. It can be found at wet coastal sea level locales and the coldest, driest elevations of the Sierra Nevada, as well as many areas in between. The species is not uncommon, but some specific varieties are quite rare. Butterflies\nNectar-feeding insects such as butterflies are attracted to buckwheat flowers. At least one butterfly subspecies (Apodemia mormo langei) uses naked buckwheat as its primary food source. The complex of varieties and subspecies of naked buckwheat includes:\nEriogonum nudum var.",

Legacy\nIn 2010 a monument dedicated to Kalaitović was placed in the village of Štitkovo on the Kalaitović family estate. Serbian historian Salih Selimović states that Kalaitović protected the Muslim population and never attacked any of Muslim localities within the zone of his responsibility. When, during 1945, Communist authorities discovered that Kalaitović was hiding in the village of Kladnica, they blocked the area, but Muslim villagers helped Kalaitović to hide and escape. Serbian historian Dubravka Stojanović objected to the monument in Štitkovo because Kalaitović's units did commit war crimes.

Costinha was released by the Spaniards in August 2007, joining Atalanta BC of Serie A, where he appeared very rarely throughout his spell   only one match, in his first season   due to serious injuries and later because he was not considered fit to play competitively, despite him having the highest salary in the first team ( 700,000 per year, in a contract due to expire in June 2010). The club tried to agree a mutual termination of the contract with him, and also attempted unsuccessfully to rescind it through the Italian Football League.",

International career\nCostinha made his debut for Portugal on 14 October 1998, in a 3 0 home win over Slovakia for the UEFA Euro 2000 qualifiers; he entered as a 67th-minute substitute in place of Rui Costa. He was selected for the final stages, where he scored an injury time header against Romania (same score). He also played at Euro 2004 and the 2006 FIFA World Cup tournaments. During the latter, on 25 June, he took part in the Battle of Nuremberg, being one of four players sent off in the 1 0 round-of-16 victory over the Netherlands after two bookable offences, the second being a handball. Costinha finished his international career with 53 caps and two goals, having been rarely called during the Euro 2008 qualifying stage. Coaching career\nDirector\nOn 23 February 2010, the 35-year-old Costinha left Atalanta by mutual consent. He immediately retired, being named shortly afterwards as Sporting's director of football, succeeding the sacked Ricardo Sá Pinto, his former international teammate. On 9 February 2011, the day after an interview to Sport TV in which he criticised the club's board of directors, he was dismissed.",

Known as Waterloo Road, the state highway runs 1.14 miles (1.83 km) from MD 108 in Columbia north to MD 103 in Ellicott City. MD 104 connects MD 108, MD 103, and MD 100 in northeastern Howard County. The state highway was originally constructed as MD 531 in the early 1930s and became part of MD 175 in the mid-1940s. After MD 175 was rerouted through Columbia in the late 1970s, MD 104 was assigned to its present course. Route description\nMD 104 begins at a three-way intersection with MD 108 in the hamlet of Jonestown on the northern edge of the Columbia village of Long Reach. MD 108 heads southeast as a continuation of Waterloo Road toward Jessup and west as Old Annapolis Road, which provides access to Howard High School and ramps to and from eastbound MD 100. MD 104 heads north as a four-lane undivided highway across MD 100 to a roundabout where the state highway intersects ramps to and from westbound MD 100.",

MD 104 reduces to two lanes and passes through a suburban area on the southern edge of Ellicott City, where the highway reaches its northern terminus at MD 103 (Montgomery Road), which heads southeast toward Elkridge and northwest toward downtown Ellicott City. History\nWaterloo Road was built as a macadam road in 1932 from U.S. Route 1 (US 1) in Jessup north to MD 103 in Ellicott City; the highway was designated MD 531. MD 531 was replaced with a northern extension of MD 175 from Jessup to Ellicott City by 1946. Old Annapolis Road was designated MD 539 in 1956; that highway became part of an extended MD 108 in 1960 when US 29 was moved to Columbia Pike from Silver Spring to Ellicott City. After MD 175 was rerouted along Little Patuxent Parkway (now named Rouse Parkway) from west of Interstate 95 (I-95) to Columbia Town Center around 1977, MD 108 was extended east to its present terminus near I-95. The portion of Waterloo Road between MD 108 and MD 103 was designated MD 104 by 1979.",

The marriage was  contrary to the laws of God , and she was returned to Yedingham Priory. Life\nLutton was born about 1498. Her father was Stephen Lutton, and her grandfather, William Lutton, owned land in Knapton. About 1512, when she was fourteen years old, she became a Benedictine nun at Yedingham Priory in North Yorkshire. She later complained that she had become a nun contrary to her wishes. In 1526 Agnes Brayerdricke succeeded Dame Elizabeth White as head of Yedingham Priory and Brayerdricke soon discovered that Elizabeth Lutton was pregnant. Brayerdricke had her separated from the other nuns until the child was born. Lutton was then allowed to resume her place. Local landowner Robert Constable of Flamborough visited Yedingham Priory where he learned about Elizabeth Lutton. Constable encouraged Thomas Scaseby to elope with Elizabeth Lutton in 1531. Scaseby may have been the father of the child, and he married Lutton. This was a serious crime, as Lutton was still under vows as a nun.",

Constable's motive for getting involved was that Elizabeth was a potential heiress, and the marriage was to Constable's advantage in his own territorial disputes. Lutton argued that she had become a nun under duress, and she was therefore free to marry and to inherit her grandfather's lands. She was supported by the Abbess but not by any of the other nuns. Result\nLutton's uncle took the resulting dispute to the Star Chamber. He had inherited Lutton's grandfather's lands, and Constable had seized them, citing Lutton's marriage. In 1532, an ecclesiastical judge from York arrived to interview all who were involved. The judges decided that Lutton's marriage was  contrary to the laws of God and Holly Church, and to the detestable and pernicious example of all other lyke offendors, and to the ruin and decay of holly religion . Lutton returned to being a nun, and her uncle recovered his lands. Robert Constable was executed at Hull for (other) sundry crimes on 6 July 1537.

Eddie Cantor played a classic comedy sketch of  Max, the Tailor , a small man having to deal with an unreasonable customer who wanted a belt in the back   and in the end got a different type of belt from the one he expected. Cantor did other sketches as a taxi driver and a very timid police academy candidate. Cantor premiered the song The Sheik of Araby, lyrics by Harry B. Smith and Francis Wheeler, music by Ted Snyder. This also became a major hit. The Eight Blue Devils put on a tumbling act. Act 2 opened with  Princess Beautiful (A Cleveland Bronner Ballet) . Ballet had been expected in all shows in the 1916 17 season, but by 1922 they were considered outdated. The show included various chorus spectacles. In one the women were all costumed as pink roses.

The hospital gown-clad creature was created using primitive prosthetic make-up and grayish-green body paint rather than the infamously cheap and phony-looking scalloped-scaled rubber wetsuit (with webbed fingers) and fiercely-fanged fish head mask (with painted ping-pong-ball eyes) Buchanan later used in Creature of Destruction and 'It's Alive!'. The movie was filmed in Uncertain, Texas, where the Fly-N-Fish Lodge and Airport seen in early scenes still exists. The film re-uses Ronald Stein's previous music from both It Conquered the World and Invasion of the Saucer Men. Reception\nCurse of the Swamp Creature has received predominantly negative reviews.

Jon Condit from Dread Central awarded the film 1.5 out of 5, writing,  Curse of the Swamp Creature is actually one of Z-grade schlockmeister Larry Buchanan s better movies. That s not to say that it s any good, just a comment that you can probably sit all the way through it from beginning to end without falling asleep or wanting to gouge your eyes out with your own fingers. Writing for AllMovie, critic Robert Firsching described the film as a  low-budget horror oddity  and a  forgettable trifle  that  will be of interest to genre completists only. Describing Jeff Alexander's performance as  so maniacally over the top that he s almost fascinating to watch,  critic George Reis wrote that the film  defines schlocky cinema as an art form in every way possible - from lousy acting, to shoddy camera set-ups, to an array of unintended laughs and a disappointing monster.

It started on the second day of the Soviet invasion of Poland in an attempt to assist the external attack. Background\nThe events\nThe revolt of 18 September 1939 was organized by the Communist Party of West Belarus which was outlawed by Poland in 1938. According to Russian documents, it consisted of around 200 men, although their number has been contested by Polish historian Marek Wierzbicki as exaggerated. A group of Jews and Belarusians, members and sympathizers of the delegalized Communist Party, all citizens of Poland, took control of the town of Skidel and some nearby locations, acquired firearms, often from skirmishes with Polish Army units and police.",

In a number of instances, individual or groups of former authority figures, such as civil servants, landowners, priests, rural settlers, policemen and reserve officers, usually of Polish ethnicity, were murdered, including in Skidel, Brzostowica Mała, Lerypol, Budowla, and other locations. Wierzbicki estimates that there were dozens if not hundreds of such incidents. Several Polish families were rescued by their Belarusian neighbors in the village of Sawalówka. In some settlements, the withdrawal of Polish administration ahead of the Soviet advance prompted Jewish councils to form self-defense groups against the Belarusian raids which further complicated the issue of allegiance. Some of the self-defending Jews were driven by deep-seated Polish patriotism. Polish Army units quickly engaged the insurgents.",

On 19 September 1939 the 102nd Uhlan Regiment of the Polish Army engaged some insurgents around Ostryna, Dubno and Jeziory. After some skirmishes, Polish units put down the revolt and took control of Skidel and neighboring settlements. The insurgents captured with weapons were summarily executed. Shortly afterward, on 20 September, advancing Red Army units, supported by armor, took over Skidel, pushing the Polish forces back. Aftermath\nWhen Soviet forces took over Skidel, many Poles were immediately arrested. Some time later in 1940 there was a show trial in Skidel of 15 individuals including three women, two Tartars and two Polish Russians, who aided the Polish Army which briefly retook Skidel on 19 September. They were accused of crimes against the Soviet Union. There is no historical record of what happened to them, although Wierzbicki states that fragmentary information and  common practice  suggests that at least some of them were executed. After the end of World War II, and the annexation of eastern Poland, the mass murders and robberies were hushed up and the sabotage action in Skidzieĺ turned by the Soviet Union into a province-wide liberation movement.",

In 1940 the Soviet authorities found clear evidence of the widespread robberies and mass murders committed on the side by scores of intoxicated peasants and criminal opportunists, but after the intervention of the communist party representative, the Soviet court threw out the case citing political rationale (justified class struggle), as well as procedural reasons (that it has no jurisdiction to persecute crimes that happened on those territories before the Soviet annexation of them on, that legal documents dated to 2 November 1939). After the annexation of eastern Poland, the Soviet propaganda turned the Skidzieĺ events into a liberation movement, and mythologized them.

Her adoptive parents initially saw to her education before she attended a private girls' school. When she was an adult she and her sister and two brothers all legally changed their last name to Arnold-Forster. Her brothers were Edward Penrose Arnold-Forster and Hugh Oakeley Arnold-Forster.

She took a particular interest in St James the Less Church in Pimlico and its mission; the church was built in 1850 in a poor part of London by three sisters. She wrote particularly about missionary work overseas. In 1885 she wrote Heralds of the Cross which was about missionary work. Possibly her most important work is Studies in Church Dedications: or, England's Patron Saints (1899) which was issued in three volumes. This was a novel subject for study - she looked at the reasons why churches were dedicated to particular saints. Her personal journals covering 1871-73, 1873 76, 1876 79, 1879 83, 1883 85, and 1885-87 are extant. Private life\nShe did not marry.

    "text": "Vasopressin receptor 2 (V2R), or arginine vasopressin receptor 2 (officially called AVPR2), is a protein that acts as receptor for vasopressin. AVPR2 belongs to the subfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors. Its activity is mediated by the Gs type of G proteins, which stimulate adenylate cyclase. AVPR2 is expressed in the kidney tubule, predominantly in the membrane of cells of the distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts, in fetal lung tissue and lung cancer, the last two being associated with alternative splicing. AVPR2 is also expressed outside the kidney in vascular endothelium. Stimulation causes the release of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII from the endothelial cells. Because von Willebrand factor helps stabilize circulating levels of factor VIII, the vasopressin analog desmopressin can be used to stimulate the AVPR2 receptor and increase levels of circulating factor VIII. This is useful in the treatment of hemophilia A as well as Von Willebrand disease. In the kidney, AVPR2's primary property is to respond to arginine vasopressin by stimulating mechanisms that concentrate the urine and maintain water homeostasis in the organism. When the function of AVPR2 is lost, the disease nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) results.",

Antagonists\nVasopressin receptor antagonists that are selective for the V2 receptor include:\nTolvaptan (FDA-approved)\nLixivaptan\nMozavaptan\nSatavaptan\nTheir main uses are in hyponatremia, such as that caused by syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) and heart failure, however these agents should be avoided in patients with cirrhosis.

Pharmacoperones\nVasopressin receptor 2 function has been shown to be deleteriously effected by point mutations in its gene. Some of these mutations, when expressed, cause the receptor to remain in the cytosol. An approach to rescue receptor function utilizes pharmacoperones or molecular chaperones, which are typically small molecules that rescue misfolded proteins to the cell surface. These interact with the receptor to restore cognate receptor function devoid of antagonist or agonist activity. This approach, when effective, should increase therapeutic reach.

The holotype specimen is held in the New Zealand Arthropod Collection. Description\nBoth the male and female adults have wings and their wingspan is 25mm. This moth is similar in appearance to Proditrix megalynta with its buff coloured body and legs but P. chionochloae have a greater number of dark spots on the top of their wings. P. chionochloae can also be distinguished as its genital characteristics are different from P. megalynta and they have a longer third segment of the labial palpi. Distribution\nThis species is endemic to New Zealand. It can only be found in Taupō and Taranaki at the Pouakai Range. Host plant\nThe host plant of this species is Chionochloa rubra.

    "text": "Charles Parker Jr. (August 29, 1920   March 12, 1955), nicknamed  Bird  or  Yardbird , was an American jazz saxophonist, bandleader, and composer. Parker was a highly influential soloist and leading figure in the development of bebop, a form of jazz characterized by fast tempos, virtuosic technique, and advanced harmonies. He was a virtuoso and introduced revolutionary rhythmic and harmonic ideas into jazz, including rapid passing chords, new variants of altered chords, and chord substitutions. Parker primarily played the alto saxophone. Parker was an icon for the hipster subculture and later the Beat Generation, personifying the jazz musician as an uncompromising artist and intellectual rather than just an entertainer. Early life\nCharles Parker Jr. was born in Kansas City, Kansas, to Charles Parker Sr. and Adelaide  Addie  Bailey, who was of mixed Choctaw and African-American background. He was raised in Kansas City, Missouri, near Westport Road. His father, a Pullman waiter and chef on the railways, was often required to travel for work, but provided some musical influence because he was a pianist, dancer, and singer on the Theatre Owners Booking Association circuit. Parker's mother worked nights at the local Western Union office during the 1920s.",

Parker first went to a Catholic school and sang in its choir, but his parents separated in 1930 due to his father's alcoholism and the effects of the Great Depression. By the time he was in high school, Parker, his older half-brother John, and his mother Addie were living near 15th Street and Olive Street and she was working as a cleaner in order to afford housing. Parker began playing the saxophone at age 11, and at age 14 he joined the Lincoln High School band, where he studied under bandmaster Alonzo Lewis. His mother purchased a new alto saxophone around the same time. Parker's biggest influence in his early teens was a young trombone player named Robert Simpson, who taught him the basics of improvisation. Parker withdrew from high school in December 1935, joined the local musicians' union, and decided to pursue his musical career full-time. Career\n1936 1938: Jam sessions and woodshedding\nUpon leaving high school, Parker began to play with local bands in jazz clubs around Kansas City and often ambitiously took part in jam sessions with more experienced musicians. In early 1936, at one such jam session with the Count Basie Orchestra, he lost track of the chord changes while improvising.",

This prompted Jo Jones to contemptuously remove a cymbal from his drum kit and throw it at his feet as a signal to leave the stage. Rather than becoming discouraged, Parker vowed to practice harder. He mastered improvisation and, according to his comments in an interview with Paul Desmond, spent the next three to four years practicing up to 15 hours a day. Parker proposed to Rebecca Ruffin, his girlfriend four years his senior, and the two married on July 25, 1936. They had two children before divorcing in 1939, in large part due to his growing drug addiction. In late 1936, Parker and a Kansas City band traveled to the Ozarks for the opening of Musser's Resort south of Eldon, Missouri. Along the way, the caravan of musicians had a car accident and Parker broke three ribs and fractured his spine. Despite this near-death experience, in 1937 Parker returned to the area, where he spent a great deal of time woodshedding and developing his sound. Working with a pianist and guitarist, he practiced improvising over chord changes and began to develop the ability to solo fluently across chords and scales. In 1938, Parker joined pianist Jay McShann's territory band.",

His first gig with the band was during the summer or early fall at the Continental Club in Kansas City, where Parker worked as a substitute alto saxophonist for Edward  Popeye  Hale. In December, he joined Harlan Leonard's Rockets; the band played at dances including a Christmas dance for which Parker was listed in a local newspaper as one of the Rockets' personnel. 1939 1944: Development of bebop\nIn 1939, Parker moved to New York City to pursue his musical career but worked part-time jobs to make a living. Among the more musically significant of these was as a dishwasher for nine dollars a week at Jimmie's Chicken Shack, where pianist Art Tatum performed. Struggling with poverty, Parker went to the home of fellow alto saxophone player Buster Smith to ask for help. Smith allowed Parker to live in his apartment for six months and gave him gigs in his band. Parker's playing at the gigs impressed several New York musicians, including pianist and bandleader Earl Hines. While living in New York, Parker achieved his musical breakthrough, developing a new improvisational vocabulary which later came to be known as  bebop .",

Playing  Cherokee  in a practice session with guitarist William  Biddy  Fleet, he realized that the 12 semitones of the chromatic scale can lead melodically to any key, breaking some of the confines of simpler jazz soloing. Parker recalled:  I'd been getting bored with the stereotyped changes that were being used all the time at the time, and I kept thinking there's bound to be something else. I could hear it sometimes but I couldn't play it ... Well, that night I was working over 'Cherokee' and, as I did, I found that by using the higher intervals of a chord as a melody line and backing them with appropriately related changes, I could play the thing I'd been hearing. I came alive. In 1940, he returned to Kansas City to perform with Jay McShann and to attend the funeral of his father, Charles Sr. The younger Parker then spent the summer in McShann's band playing at Fairyland Park for all-white audiences; trumpet player Bernard Anderson introduced him to Dizzy Gillespie. The band also toured nightclubs and other venues of the southwest, as well as Chicago and New York City, and Parker made his professional recording debut with McShann's band that year.",

When in New York, to experiment with his new musical ideas that went beyond the bounds of McShann's group, Parker joined a group of young musicians who played in after-hours clubs in Harlem venues including Clark Monroe's Uptown House. Fellow musicians at the venues included developing beboppers Gillespie, pianist Thelonious Monk, guitarist Charlie Christian, and drummer Kenny Clarke. A pianist and one of the pioneers of bebop, Mary Lou Williams, said the after-hours sessions were an opportunity  to challenge the practice of downtown musicians coming uptown and 'stealing' the music. Parker left McShann's band in 1942 and played for one year with Hines, whose band also included Gillespie. This band's performances and therefore Parker's role in them are virtually undocumented due to the strike of 1942 1944 by the American Federation of Musicians, during which time few professional recordings were made. In fact, much of bebop's critical early development was not captured for posterity due to the ban and the new genre gained limited radio exposure as a result.",

The few recordings in which Parker participated in 1943 took place in Chicago and included a jam session recording with Gillespie and bassist Oscar Pettiford, another session with Billy Eckstine playing trumpet, some informally recorded practice sessions, and a duo with pianist Hazel Scott. Parker's time with Hines's band and his travel between New York and Chicago enabled him to model his style on, according to his own words, a  combination of the Midwestern beat and the fast New York tempos. Parker began writing compositions thanks to his growing friendship with Gillespie, who began notating Parker's solos as melodies. Among these early Parker compositions were  Koko ,  Anthropology , and  Confirmation . Parker left Hines's band and formed a small group with Gillespie, pianist Al Haig, bassist Curley Russell, and drummer Stan Levey. The group stood out from its contemporaries, as it was racially integrated and lacked a guitarist for rhythmic support. This new format freed soloists from harmonic and rhythmic restrictions, and in late 1944 the group secured a gig at the Three Deuces club in New York. The group's name recognition spread along 52nd Street and its style was dubbed  bebop  for the first time.",

One of their first small-group performances together, a concert in New York's Town Hall on June 22, 1945, was rediscovered in 2004 and released in 2005. Bebop soon gained wider appeal among musicians and fans. On November 26, 1945, Parker led a record date for Savoy Records, marketed as the  greatest Jazz session ever . Recording as Charlie Parker's Reboppers, Parker enlisted sidemen Gillespie and Miles Davis on trumpet, Curley Russell on bass and Max Roach on drums. The tracks recorded during this session include  Ko-Ko ,  Billie's Bounce , and  Now's the Time .

After he dedicated one of his compositions to local drug dealer  Moose the Mooche  at a studio session in the spring, the dealer was arrested, and without access to heroin, Parker turned to alcohol addiction. He suffered a physical and mental breakdown after a studio session in July 1946 for Dial Records, and was briefly jailed after setting the bedsheets of his Los Angeles hotel room on fire and then running naked through the lobby while intoxicated, after which he was committed to the Camarillo State Mental Hospital for six months. When Parker was discharged from the hospital, he was healthy and free from his drug habit. Before leaving California, he recorded  Relaxin' at Camarillo,  in reference to his stay in the mental hospital, at one of two successful recording sessions. The first took place with a septet while the other paired Parker with pianist Erroll Garner's trio and vocalist Earl Coleman. Upon returning to New York in 1947, Parker resumed his heroin usage. He recorded dozens of sides for the Savoy and Dial labels, which remain some of the high points of his recorded output. Many of these were with his new quintet, including Davis and Roach.",

Parker and Davis disagreed on who should be the quintet's pianist, with Parker originally hiring Bud Powell for a May 1947 recording session but later favoring Gillespie's arranger, John Lewis; Davis preferred Duke Jordan. Ultimately the quintet used both, as Parker wanted to balance leadership of the group with mentoring younger musicians such as Davis. Following the establishment of a regular quintet, Parker signed for Mercury Records with Jazz at the Philharmonic promoter Norman Granz as his producer. The partnership enabled Parker to work with musicians from other genres, such as Latin jazz percussionist and bandleader Machito, and to appear in concerts at Carnegie Hall as part of the Jazz at the Philharmonic series. Further, Granz was able to fulfil a longstanding desire of Parker's to perform with a string section. He was a keen student of classical music, and contemporaries reported he was most interested in the music and formal innovations of Igor Stravinsky and longed to engage in a project akin to what later became known as Third Stream, a new kind of music, incorporating both jazz and classical elements as opposed to merely incorporating a string section into performance of jazz standards.",

In 1950, Parker and Gillespie recorded Bird and Diz, an album that proved to be among the few times Parker worked with bebop pianist Thelonious Monk; the music was released in 1952. Meanwhile, Parker's regular group maintained popular success with a European tour in 1950 and live gigs at New York nightclubs continued, leading to live albums One Night in Birdland (with Fats Navarro and Powell) and Summit Meeting at Birdland (with Gillespie and Powell). But Parker became frustrated and disillusioned that, due to racial discrimination, he was reaching the limits of what he could achieve in his career. In 1953, Parker performed at Massey Hall in Toronto, joined by Gillespie, Mingus, Powell, and Roach. The concert happened at the same time as a televised heavyweight boxing match between Rocky Marciano and Jersey Joe Walcott, so it was poorly attended.

He was hospitalized and made a partial recovery by early 1955 before his health declined again in March. Parker's last gig on March 4 at Birdland ended when Powell refused to play in his group and the performance spiraled into an argument among the musicians.

The official causes of death were lobar pneumonia and a bleeding ulcer, but Parker also had advanced cirrhosis and had suffered a heart attack and a seizure.

Later, some people wanted to move Parker's remains to reinforce redevelopment of the historic 18th and Vine area. Personal life\nParker acquired the nickname  Yardbird  early in his career while on the road with Jay McShann. This, and the shortened form  Bird , were used as nicknames for Parker for the rest of his life and inspired the titles of a number of Parker's compositions, such as  Yardbird Suite ,  Ornithology ,  Bird Gets the Worm , and  Bird of Paradise . Parker's life was riddled with mental health problems and an addiction to heroin. Although it is unclear which came first, his addiction to opiates began at the age of 16, when he was injured in a car crash and a doctor prescribed morphine for the pain. The addiction that stemmed from this incident led him to miss performances, and he was considered to be unreliable. In the jazz scene, heroin use was prevalent and the substance could be acquired with little difficulty. Although he produced many brilliant recordings during this period, Parker's behavior became increasingly erratic. Heroin was difficult to obtain once he moved to California, where the drug was less abundant, so he used alcohol as a substitute.",

Heroin was difficult to obtain once he moved to California, where the drug was less abundant, so he used alcohol as a substitute. A recording for the Dial label from July 29, 1946, provides evidence of his condition. Before this session, Parker drank a quart of whiskey. According to the liner notes of Charlie Parker on Dial Volume 1, Parker missed most of the first two bars of his first chorus on the track  Max Making Wax . When he finally did come in, he swayed wildly and once spun all the way around, away from his microphone. On the next tune,  Lover Man , producer Ross Russell physically supported Parker. On  Bebop  (the final track Parker recorded that evening), he begins a solo with a solid first eight bars; on his second eight bars, however, he begins to struggle, and a desperate Howard McGhee, the trumpeter on this session, shouts,  Blow! at him. Charles Mingus, however, considered this version of  Lover Man  to be among Parker's greatest recordings, despite its flaws. Nevertheless, Parker hated the recording and never forgave Ross Russell for releasing it. He re-recorded the tune in 1951 for Verve. Parker's life took a turn for the worse in March 1954 when his three-year-old daughter Pree died of cystic fibrosis and pneumonia.",

Artistry\nParker's style of composition involved interpolation of original melodies over existing jazz forms and standards, a practice known as contrafact and still common in jazz today. Examples include  Ornithology  (which borrows the chord progression of jazz standard  How High the Moon  and is said to be co-written with trumpet player Little Benny Harris), and  Moose The Mooche  (one of many Parker compositions based on the chord progression of  I Got Rhythm ). The practice was not uncommon prior to bebop, but it became a signature of the movement as artists began to move away from arranging popular standards and toward composing their own material. Perhaps Parker's most well-known contrafact is  Koko , which is based on the chord changes of the popular bebop tune  Cherokee , written by Ray Noble.",

    "text": "Perhaps Parker's most well-known contrafact is  Koko , which is based on the chord changes of the popular bebop tune  Cherokee , written by Ray Noble. While tunes such as  Now's the Time ,  Billie's Bounce ,  Au Privave ,  Barbados ,  Relaxin' at Camarillo ,  Bloomdido , and  Cool Blues  were based on conventional 12-bar blues changes, Parker also created a unique version of the 12-bar blues for tunes such as  Blues for Alice ,  Laird Baird , and  Si Si. These unique chords are known popularly as  Bird Changes . Like his solos, some of his compositions are characterized by long, complex melodic lines and a minimum of repetition, although he did employ the use of repetition in some tunes, most notably  Now's the Time . Parker contributed greatly to the modern jazz solo, one in which triplets and pick-up notes were used in unorthodox ways to lead into chord tones, affording the soloist more freedom to use passing tones, which soloists previously avoided. His recordings were used for a book of solo transcriptions, the posthumously published Charlie Parker Omnibook.",

Parker is referenced in the 2023 video game Marvel's Spider-Man 2. In the game, there is a side mission in which Parker's Saxophone is stolen and must be recovered by Miles Morales   Spider-Man. Once recovered, a character discusses Parker's music, making reference to his song,  Ornithology , and discussing his impact on jazz and hip hop. Parker is mentioned in the comic strip The Far Side and Gary Larson invites his audience to find amusement in what he perceives as Parker's disdain for introspective or slow-moving New Age music; implying that the legendary saxophonist would find it  hellishly  insipid.

This means that anybody who is interested in the work of RIPE can participate through mailing lists and by attending meetings. RIPE has a chair to keep an eye on work between RIPE meetings and to act as its external liaison. Rob Blokzijl, who was instrumental in the formation of RIPE, was the initial chair and remained in that position until 2014, when he appointed Hans Petter Holen as his successor. The RIPE community interacts via RIPE Mailing Lists, RIPE Working Groups, and RIPE Meetings. Although similar in name, the RIPE NCC and RIPE are separate entities.

It brought together 14 representatives of 6 countries and 11 networks At the time European governments, standardisation bodies and telecommunications companies were pushing for the OSI standard and IP-based networks were seen as the wrong way to go. In the academic community (mostly nuclear and particle physics) there was a strong need to work together with colleagues across Europe and the United States. IP provided a standard to allow interconnection and cooperation, whereas the networks offered by the European telecommunications companies often completely lacked that. RIPE as an organisation was established by the RIPE terms of reference, which were agreed on 29 November 1989. There were ten organisations intending to participate in the RIPE Coordinating Committee, along the lines defined by the RIPE Terms of Reference, though some still needed to make a formal decision. These organisations were: BelWue, CERN, EASInet, EUnet, GARR, HEPnet, NORDUnet, SURFnet, SWITCH and XLINK.

According to the 2024 census, it has a population of 54,635 people. Etymology\nThe name  Burauen  evolved from the word  haru  which means  spring . This is because Burauen is the fountainhead of several rivers: the big Daguitan and Marabong rivers, the Guinarona and Hibuga rivers that pass through several neighboring towns, as well as several smaller ones. The legend behind the name speaks of a drought when several tributaries of these rivers dried up, forcing people to flock to a cluster of large springs in the town. The place was duly called  Buraburon  which, according to Justice Norberto Lopez Romualdez Sr., is the  multiplicative construction of the word  haru  (spring), which indicates  abundance . Over the years, the name  Buraburon  ( having many springs ) evolved into  Burawon  and finally into  Burauen .

    "text": "Saskatchewan Party\nFollowing his federal election loss in 1997, Hermanson turned his attention to provincial politics. That year also saw the foundation of the Saskatchewan Party as a new conservative party in the province, bringing together former Progressive Conservatives, some Liberal members, and Reform Party organizers. Hermanson sought the leadership of the new party in 1998, facing off against Rod Gantefoer, a former Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan (MLA), and political newcomer Yogi Huyghebaert. On April 20, 1998, Hermanson was elected the first Saskatchewan Party leader in a one member, one vote election. Aware that the conservative base in the province was in rural areas, Hermanson stated that people  know I have the best interests of the agriculture industry and rural Saskatchewan at heart because that's where I still live . Hermanson did not have a seat in the legislature, and he declined to run in a 1998 Saskatoon by-election, instead waiting for the next general election to run for a seat. This left Ken Krawetz to serve as the interim House Opposition leader. Under Hermanson, the Saskatchewan Party campaigned on an ambitious fiscal conservative platform, calling for major corporate and income tax cuts, along with a number of controversial and social conservative policies, from a commitment to consider privatizing crown corporations to work-for-welfare policies and an end to public affirmative action.",

    "text": "Hermanson was elected in the 1999 provincial election for Rosetown Biggar and, leading the Saskatchewan Party to a strong performance, became Leader of the Opposition. The new party shocked the province in winning a small plurality of the popular vote, but it was completely shut out in the urban centres of Regina and Saskatoon. Ultimately, this left the Saskatchewan Party with 25 seats. However, the result reduced the Saskatchewan New Democratic Party (NDP) to a minority government with 29 seats, forcing Premier Roy Romanow to form a coalition government with the remaining Liberals. After this strong performance, Hermanson was widely expected to lead the party to victory in the next election, and the party led polling heading into 2003. The party again campaigned on a platform of tax reductions and decreased government involvement in the economy, but it remained bogged down by questions about its conservatism and its plans for crown corporations. Hermanson continued to state that he would be willing to entertain offers for the province's crown corporations and the NDP, now led by Lorne Calvert, made this a focal point of their campaign. At one point in the campaign, Hermanson criticized the NDP for a leaked internal cartoon that depicted him as a Nazi loading NDP sympathizers onto rail cars. Ultimately, the 2003 election would prove a major disappointment for the Saskatchewan Party as the NDP won a bare majority.",

However, he committed to remaining the MLA for Rosetown Elrose. In March 2004, Hermanson was succeeded by Brad Wall when he was acclaimed the new Saskatchewan Party leader. On June 23, 2006, Hermanson announced that he would not be seeking re-election to the legislature, marking the end of his run in provincial politics. Wall would lead the Saskatchewan Party to a majority government in the 2007 election, while party member Jim Reiter succeeded Hermanson as Rosetown Elrose MLA.

The thirteenth named storm, seventh hurricane and third major hurricane of the extremely active 1995 Atlantic hurricane season, Marilyn formed on September 12 as a tropical depression from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on September 7. After formation, the storm quickly became a tropical storm, and steadily intensified into a hurricane by the time it struck the Lesser Antilles on September 14 at Category 1 strength. Entering the northeastern Caribbean Sea, rapid intensification ensued and it peaked on September 16 north of Puerto Rico as a Category 3 hurricane shortly after it had impacted the U.S. Virgin Islands. A Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance flight reported hail, which is unusual for tropical cyclones. After heading north past Bermuda, Marilyn weakened and became extratropical on September 22. The remnant circulation wandered the Atlantic Ocean from September 23   October 1, just south of Nova Scotia. Marilyn is responsible for a total of thirteen deaths, most due to drowning on boats or offshore. Eleven thousand people were left homeless on the island of St. Thomas, and estimated damages were set at  2 billion (1995 USD) in the USVI.",

Meteorological history\nMarilyn's origins were from a tropical wave that formed off the African coast on September 7. Large, low-level winds were included in the wave's circulation, but little convection existed. The system continued west for a few days at about 19 mph (31 km h) next to an anticyclonic aloft. On September 12, satellite pictures viewed the disorganized wave and declared it Tropical Depression Fifteen, after convection had increased. Tropical Depression Fifteen strengthened rapidly, becoming Tropical Storm Marilyn six hours later. One day after being named, Marilyn was upgraded to hurricane status, while turning on a more northwesterly track. For the next few days, Marilyn's track took it towards the west-northwest and to the northwest, due to a weakness in the subtropical ridge. Marilyn was a Category 1 hurricane; it passed 52 mi (84 km) north of Barbados and Martinique.",

The eyewall, east-southeast of the center of Marilyn, passed over Saint Thomas later that day. After passing over Puerto Rico, Marilyn entered back into the Atlantic Ocean on September 16. A low had formed near Marilyn, which may have enhanced outflow from the system. An eye formed in the center of Marilyn, and the storm reached a peak intensity of 949 millibars and winds of 115 mph (185 km h), a lower-end Category 3 hurricane. At this time, Marilyn was predicted to peak in wind speeds of 120 125 mph (193 201 km h). Reconnaissance data found a concentric pair of eyewall wind maxima.

Damage on St. Thomas was remiscent of the damage seen on St. Croix in 1989, when Hurricane Hugo, a category 4 storm, caused catastrophic damage. Because St. Thomas is a very hilly island, it is possible that sustained winds on exposed hills (some of which have elevations that are thousands of feet above sea level) were significantly stronger than the sea-level wind speed estimates given by the hurricane center in its main advisory.

Modern Moreton remains at the convergence of various minor roads, however, which link to Fyfield, to the east, Bobbingworth to the south, High Laver to the west and Matching to the north. Where the roads meet there remain several substantial village houses from the late Medieval   early modern period as well as two traditional English pubs, being the White Hart and the Nag's Head. Directly to the east of the Nag's Head, Moreton features a primary school, which retains its small Victorian era main building, but in recent decades has grown as schools in neighbouring villages have been closed down. The surrounding area is agricultural.",

Apart from that, commercial activity has largely abandoned the village, and today many residents commute to Harlow, Loughton, Chelmsford or London. For many years after petrol and diesel engined tractors became mainstream in England, Moreton retained a depot housing steam tractors (traction engines) but historical traction engines are no longer a feature of Moreton.

Stefano was born in the then French colony of Grenada, and died in the then French colony of Mauritius. In his youth, he had traveled on merchant trade ships to the Antilles and India. On his return from Bengal in 1788, he met a captain Portlocke in St Helena who described his profitable trade in furs in the American Northwest. In December 1790, he was entrusted by a Marseille shipping group, Casa Baux, to travel on the vessel Solido to the American Northwest to trade for animal pelts. The first leg of his journey took him on June 12, 1791, past the Marquesas, from there traveling northwest, he claimed discovery of various islands previously visited by Captain Cook. His lengthy stays meant he only reached in August 7 to reach Cape of Edgecombe (near present-day Kruzof Island, Alaska). He proceeded north to Tchin Kitanae bay (also called Nordfolk Bay, now Sitka Sound), where he traded for otter pelts. He then moved to Nootka Sound and proceeded south along the coast. He left America on 8 September and made his way to the Hawaiian Islands.",

Oil companies drilled five wells in Atlantic Florida state waters and 51 exploratory wells on federal leases on the outer continental shelf of the Atlantic coast. None of the wells were completed as producing wells. All the leases have now reverted to the government. Although no oil or gas have been produced from beneath U.S. Atlantic waters, there are active offshore fields to the south in offshore Cuba and to the north in offshore Canada. Each US state along the Atlantic coast owns as territorial waters out to three nautical miles (3.45 statute, or land miles) from the shore at mean low tide, and has jurisdiction to decide whether or not, and under what terms, to lease the territory for oil and gas. The federal government owns and controls the minerals between three and 200 nautical miles (370 km) from the shore. In accordance with congressional restrictions and presidential orders, no federal leasing has taken place on the offshore Atlantic coast of the United States since the early 1980s. The federal government had scheduled a lease sale for offshore Virginia, to take place in 2011, and in March 2010, President Barack Obama announced his intention to open the Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic planning areas to oil and gas exploration.",

The US Geological Survey estimates that the North Cuba Basin contains 5.5 billion barrels (870,000,000 m3) of undiscovered petroleum liquids and 9.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, almost all in the offshore part of the basin. The issue of allowing oil and gas exploration offshore Florida became a hotly contested topic in the 2008 US elections. In a column published 5 June 2008, syndicated columnist George Will wrote that a Chinese oil company was then drilling in Cuban waters 60 miles (97 km) from the Florida coast, a claim that was repeated by candidates in favor of offshore drilling. George Will later acknowledged that no drilling was then taking place in that part of Cuban waters. In 2004 the Spanish oil company Repsol-YPF drilled in deep Cuban waters between Cuba and the Florida Keys, and found an oil deposit; the deposit was judged noncommercial, and the hole was plugged. Repsol returned in 2012 to drill three more dry holes in deepwater locations in partnership with the Norwegian company Statoil, then halted further attempts.

Five companies applied to the MMS to conduct seismic exploration surveys off the U.S. Atlantic coast. The MMS requested funding for an Environmental Impact Statement to decide whether of not to allow the proposed seismic surveys. The possible offshore lease sale became an issue in the 2009 race for governor of Virginia. The winner, Bob McDonnell, urged during his tenure that the sale take place. In May 2010, President Obama announced his decision to cancel the offshore Virginia lease sale, in response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.

Result\nAs a result of the battle, the Danish border with the Holy Roman Empire was moved north again from river Elbe to the Eider River, the southern border of the Duchy of Schleswig. This border remained in effect until 1806. The victorious Adolf IV of Schauenburg regained the County of Holstein and his fellow victor Albert I, Duke of Saxony reasserted himself as liege lord of the Counts of Schauenburg and Holstein against the Welf claim. Dithmarschen shook off Danish supremacy and returned to a very loose overlordship by the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen, paving the way for its de facto autonomy as a peasant republic until 1559. The Principality of Rügen was the only possession in the Holy Roman Empire left to Valdemar after the battle.

The village was rebuilt in 1977, close to the old village destroyed in 1948 during the 1947 1949 Palestine war. Location\nThe village of 'Akbara was situated 2.5 km south of Safad, along the two sides of a deep wadi that ran north south. Southeast of the village lay Khirbet al-'Uqeiba, identified as the Roman village Achabare, or Acchabaron. This khirba was a populated village as late as 1904. History\nThe first 'Akbara mention is during Second Temple period by Josephus Flavius, he noted the rock of Acchabaron (Ακχαβαρων πετραν) among the places in the Upper Galilee he fortified as a preparation for the First Jewish Revolt, while leading rebel forces against the Romans in Galilee. This site is identified with caves situated along the cliffs south of 'Akbara.

The current location of the stone is unknown. Above the settlement, a 135 m high vertical cliff is located. There are one hundred and twenty-nine natural and man-made caves interconnected by passages in the cliff. According to tradition, those caves were used for shelter by Jews during their war with Romans. During archeological excavations, coins from Dor and Sepphoris were found in the caves, dating to the Roman emperor Trajan period. Akbara Akbari Akbora Akborin is mentioned several times in Rabbinic literature as early as second half of the third century CE.

Round these are grouped the remains of ancient constructions now overthrown. The village lies on the east of the wady. It is dominated by a platform on which foundations can be traced of a rectangular enclosure called el Kuneiseh, measuring thirty paces in length by twenty-three in breadth.

Since 1980, however, these internal refugees have been gradually relocated to the nearby, planned village of 'Akbara, 0.5 km west of the old village site.

    "text": "Pure is the second studio album by English industrial metal band Godflesh. It was released on 13 April 1992 through Earache Records. Though originally labeled only as industrial metal, the album has since been recognised as one of the earliest post-metal releases. Musically, Pure is rhythmically mechanical and features harsh guitars, with protracted songs and an abundance of deliberate repetition. Like much of Godflesh's music, it is regarded as particularly heavy and aggressive, and these elements helped it gain critical acclaim. Pure was supported by the promotional single of and music video for  Mothra , and the 1991 EP Cold World was recorded in the same sessions as the album. In 2013, Godflesh performed the majority of Pure live at Roadburn. Despite dissatisfaction with the production quality of the album, Godflesh frontman Justin Broadrick considers it one of the band's most honest releases. In 2012, Fact ranked Pure as the 64th best album of the 1990s. Background\nAfter the release of Godflesh's first album, 1989's Streetcleaner, the band played concerts across Europe and eventually embarked on a 1991 tour of North America with labelmates Napalm Death. This was the first time frontman Justin Broadrick and bassist G. C. Green played in America, and the band were met with unexpected favour.",

Broadrick elaborated upon their reception in a 2010 interview with Exclaim, saying,  By the time we got there, the band had already grown beyond my expectations, it was already becoming a popular band in the underground, which we hadn't really expected. It was very much a surprise for us that people responded so positively to the music . It was this tour that solidified Godflesh as a full-time project, and once it was over, Broadrick and Green returned to the studio. After the release of the 1991 EP Slavestate, the band decided to focus on a second studio album. The resulting sessions led to another 1991 EP, Cold World, and Pure in 1992. With Pure, Broadrick wanted to explore the experimental side of Godflesh. However, at the time, the band were limited to 8-track reel-to-reel recording tape, which stifled some of his ambitions. To make up for the technological deficit and recent departure of second guitarist Paul Neville, Loop guitarist Robert Hampson was brought in to provide additional instrumentation. Hampson ended up playing on only half of Pure, but the additions helped reinforce the album's overwhelming sound. Broadrick later said the introduction  worked brilliantly .",

The album's title comes from Broadrick's idea that purity (especially a child's view of it) is strength. Composition\nPure is often characterised for its harsh, discordant and mechanical sound, with many critics noting its extreme weight and inhospitable mood. Unlike Streetcleaner, which featured intentionally loose guitar playing, Pure is intensely structured, regimented and stiff, dominated by repetition; The Times of Northwest Indiana called it  colossally repetitive . The guitar tone, a sound first explored by Broadrick on the 1991 Godflesh single  Slateman , is tinny and deliberately grating. Outright riffs are rare, leaving Green's bass and the programmed drums to guide the songs. Mike Gitter of RIP Magazine and Spin described the album as  a metal junkyard of strange harmonics and decayed muzak , and he called the guitars malevolent, the drum machine ice-cold and the bass clanging. Gitter concluded by writing that Pure is  two sides of technology gone amok that would rattle even Ministry's chain-link cage, and that makes Nine Inch Nails sound like the Pet Shop Boys! Hampson's and Broadrick's guitars often hang in the background, leading Pure to be a notably percussive album with hip hop-inspired elements.",

The Chicago Tribune said the album employed what sounded like  a 20-ton rhythm machine . Broadrick's vocals on Pure, which are typically sparse, come in two primary styles: guttural shouting and  distant-sounding, voice-from-the-ether singing . Spite , the album's introductory track, begins with a jaunty hip hop loop that Kristi Siegel of the Tampa Bay Times compared to the percussion-heavy work of Skinny Puppy, a band that Godflesh briefly toured with before Pure. The lyrics of  Spite  are growled and direct, leading Broadrick to describe it as  the most literal song I've ever written  before calling it  as base as I can get . The second track and the album's only single,  Mothra , is a lively, driving song with some lyrics borrowed from Leonard Cohen's 1971 song  Avalanche . Shawn Macomber of Decibel recognised  Mothra  as a fan favourite, and Joseph Schafer of the same publication called the song  a colossal chugging machine  that sounds like  getting crushed by a ton of lead .

Jason Pettigrew of Alternative Press called the song a  layered head-shock , and O'Connell wrote that the song  is all rough, rutting rhythm with a post-coital shudder fit to shift tectonic plates . The title track (named one of the five best Godflesh songs by Decibel) is built around a rhythm sample from  Let the Rhythm Hit 'Em  (1990) by Eric B. Rakim, and  Monotremata  is an exceptionally slow nine-minute song with a degree of heaviness that is, according to Noel Gardner of The Quietus,  distinctive and inimitable .

The album concludes with  Love, Hate (Slugbaiting)  and  Pure II , the latter of which is a twenty-minute ambient sprawl with faraway drums that, according to Ned Raggett of AllMusic, hit  like a distant cannon . Gitter called the piece  a maximal approach to minimalism  that was  devastating  and  rips open a black hole . While Pure is predominantly recognized as industrial metal, it has been cited as a key album to the post-metal genre, with some calling it one of the genre's founding releases. Jon Wiederhorn of Bandcamp wrote that it was  Pure, with its more expansive structures and long stretches of billowing noise, that inspired countless metal-based groups to experiment with layered washes of sound.

In 2013, Pure was played in its near entirety at Roadburn. Robert Hampson appeared and performed live with the band, playing on the songs which he originally contributed to. The Loop song  Straight to Your Heart , which had been covered by Godflesh on the bands' 1991 split EP Loopflesh Fleshloop, was also played. On 2 November 2022, the band released this performance under the title Pure : Live. Critical reception\nPure received positive reviews upon release in 1992. Since then, its acclaim has grown. When the album came out, AllMusic reviewer Ned Raggett wrote,  In terms of grinding guitars and shouted vocals  ... it's pure Godflesh ire. In another contemporary review, Melody Maker writer Sharon O'Connell praised Pure for its weight, rhythm and ability to cover traditionally miserable topics in a  strangely life-affirming, almost soaringly spiritual  way. Also writing in 1992, Mike Gitter of Spin said,  driven by a monolithic drum machine that hammers with such force it could probably shift the tectonic plates, Godflesh successfully lays claim to the title of the most gloriously uncomfortable noise on the face of the planet , and Luca Collepiccolo of Blast!",

    "text": "called the album an unmissable fusion of extreme metal and technology. Fact wrote in their 2012  The 100 Best Albums of the 1990s  list, where Pure placed number 64, that   the album  is far from the sound of Broadrick and Green going soft: one listen to the rampaging drum machines of its title track on a proper stereo is unforgiving proof of that. In 2014, Neil Kulkarni of The Quietus called the album a  stone-cold masterpiece. Later in 2015, Fact's Robin Jahdi placed Pure as the 18th best post-metal album of all time, writing  Pure is what happened when they started experimenting: incredibly harsh worlds of discordant post-punk guitar settling like factory smoke over catchy drum machine breakbeats. Brandon Stosuy of Pitchfork called the album  iconic , and Jon Wiederhorn of Revolver said that it influenced  bands ranging from Korn and Fear Factory to Isis and Converge . Some critics viewed Pure as more consistent than Streetcleaner, with greater attention paid to its beats and grooves.

Members of the genus are bioluminescent, that is they have the ability to emit light. Many species, including Photobacterium leiognathi and Photobacterium phosphoreum, Photobacterium ganghwense, Photobacterium marinum live in symbiosis with marine organisms. S.I. Paul et al. (2021) isolated and identified multiple strains of Photobacterium from marine sponges of the Saint Martin's Island Area of the Bay of Bengal, Bangladesh. Species such as Photobacterium profundum are adapted for optimal growth in the deep cold seas making it both a psychrophile (an organism capable of growth and reproduction in cold temperatures) and a piezophile (an organism which thrives at high pressures).

They may be free-living or found as colonies associated with certain species of fish. These organisms do not contain any pigmentation and therefore will appear white or colorless. When there is a high density of cells forming a colony, they will exhibit fluorescence. However, the fluorescence is based on the accumulation of autoinducers which is proportional to cell density and therefore free-living photobacterium will not fluoresce. Their association with fish may be: symbiotic growth within fish for the formation of light organs, as a neutral entity on the surface or within the intestines of fish, as decomposers of dead fish, or as an agent of disease.

It has been noted that the infected fish will swim violently a few minutes before death occurs. Transmission infection of Photobacterium damselae subspecies damsela\nEvidence of epizootic outbreaks gained from an increase in ulcers noted among the fish populations seem to correlate to warmer seasons, suggesting a seasonal distribution in the incidence of the disease, dependent upon the waters temperature and salinity along with a decreased resistance caused by physiological changes experienced by the host during sexual maturity. Seawater is the most likely mode of transmission of the virulent cells of the pathogen. Once it comes into contact with the outer surface of the fish, it is able to adhere to skin and resist the bactericidal action of the skin mucus layer, thus suggesting that the skin is the site of entry into the host. This bacterium could therefore represent a significant threat to aquacultured fish species, especially those living in crowded and stressed conditions, where the spread of the disease could be accelerated through direct contact and thus pose a threat to humans.

He was selected All-American as a return specialist by CBS Sports in 2015. The 2015 Gators got off to an unexpected 6 0 start after entering their first four games unranked in the AP Poll. Their fourth victory was a thrilling 28 27 come-from-behind victory over Tennessee as Will Grier completed a pass on 4th-and-14 to Callaway for a 63-yard touchdown, and Tennessee could not respond as they missed a 55-yard field goal attempt as time expired. Callaway finished the 2015 season as Florida's leading receiver with 35 catches for 678 yards and four touchdowns. In January 2016, Callaway and quarterback Treon Harris were suspended from the team. Florida head coach Jim McElwain said the suspensions were related to  schoolwork. It was later revealed that the suspensions were related to an accusation of sexual assault.

A woman accused Callaway of sexual assault and Harris of attempted sexual assault in December 2015. The woman reported the alleged incident to Florida's student conduct and conflict resolution office, but did not report the incident to either Gainesville police or University of Florida police. The University of Florida suspended both players for violating the school's code of conduct policy. Both players remained suspended until June, when they returned to campus to take classes and work out at the school's facilities. Callaway was found not responsible of sexually assaulting the female student by an independent hearing officer in a Title IX hearing. The ruling was made by attorney Jake Schickel, a former track and field athlete at Florida who has donated money to Florida's football and basketball programs. Schickel cleared Callaway of three violations of Florida's student conduct code, which included endangering another's health or safety, sexual assault and sexual misconduct, and conduct causing physical injury. On December 7, 2017, while suspended, Callaway made the decision that he was going to enter the 2018 NFL draft.

The police question Amit about Roshan's murder and Amit says that Malhar is the murderer. Malhar also accepts it. Malhar then admits himself to the juvenile home. A psychologist questions him to find the fact and fails. He is reluctant to see his father too. They find scars on the boy's back, and when he asks to draw something, he draws pictures of his father murdering the girls with him watching from a distance. But he throws away those drawings and shows one in which he plays tabla. The psychologist finds the drawings in the dustbin after watching Malhar through CCTV and believes that his father is the killer and Malhar tried to save his father because he worships him. The police question the family again and it is revealed that Amit as well as Anthony's wife Sophia suspect Bhavana and Anthony of having an affair and Amit always suspected Shreya and Shruti to be Anthony's daughters. The police arrest Amit and releases Malhar. Amit tries to attack the boy, and because of this the police thinks he carried out the killings. Amit's wife also does not believe him. After a few days, while Bhavana is upstairs, Malhar throws little Sneha into the well which Bhavana witnesses from upstairs and screams.",

The skateboard chassis includes a base structure or a platform, which houses the batteries, electric motors and other electronic components fundamental to an electric vehicle. A skateboard chassis cuts down the cost and complexity of manufacturing and production of electric vehicles, as it is a self-contained platform, with all the necessary driving and electronic components integrated into it, and which can be mounted with a variety of bodies after scaling them into various sizes. The skateboard allows an automaker to design and manufacture vehicles in several vehicle categories and body segments without engineering each one independently.

My life would never be the same. On that day I decided I was going to be a journalist and I never let go of that goal. Moving to Israel as a teenager, Conway began his professional career as a 16-year-old journalist at The Jerusalem Post (in 1976). From the age of 18, back in the U.K., he was  doing shifts  on the Sunday Mirror and News of the World. He went undercover to investigative  the awful Children of God sect  and  stuff for Panorama on the National Front  back. Career\nIn the U.K. Conway was  doing almost daily hits  on BBC Radio 4 or Radio 5 Live. He had international media in his studio on a regular basis, while being  constantly interviewed  by U.S. media with  multiple appearances  on C-Span, CNN, and Fox News.",

He ran a successful corporate communications company in the U.K. He moved to Orlando, Florida, in 2001, entering the real estate business, which Conway discovered was highly competitive. There are thousands of people selling real estate in Orlando, literally,  he said, which led Conway  to distinguish himself by buying time on the radio. When he got himself a one-hour weekend show he  fell in love with the medium. From the very first moment I was on the air, I did not talk about real estate,  Conway recalls. It was like an epiphany. I had come home. Conway  fell into a career as a fill-in talk show host,  travelling across the U.S. working at  major, major stations . WHO-AM\nIn 2011, Conway took a radio show hosting position at WHO-AM in Des Moines, Iowa, replacing Steve Deace who left for a nationally-syndicated show   and adding his name to the station's  storied roster of hosts , including former president Ronald Reagan who  made a name for himself  as a WHO sportscaster in the 1930s.

Iowa caucuses\n It's a big country and the parties pick their candidates by asking the people in a series of primary elections or as in the case of Iowa, Caucuses. And Iowa is first in the nation to vote which can give a candidate the kind of momentum it takes to become President,  Conway emphasizes. About 65,000 people across Iowa tune in to WHO-AM during the afternoon drive time, the largest in Iowa for talk radio. And the audience skews toward the politically-attuned, conservative type that Republican candidates want to attract. Style\nConsidered  the voice of Midwest conservatism,  Conway reminds one journalist of  a bulldog when he interviews politicians. His training in Britain formed his aggressive approach on the air, he said. I am an equal-opportunity hater. I treat people the same whether I agree with them or  they  don't agree with me. I will always challenge their positions. He adds,  There are  as many  Republicans who don't want to face those questions as there are Democrats. The likes of  Ohio governor  John Kasich haven't been in my studio because he knows it isn't going to end well. Most important of all for me   no script,  Conway admits.",

He arranges regular, unscientific online audience polls meant for entertainment on his show. Controversy\nConway goaded Ron Paul in 2011 into admitting his noninterventionist foreign policy would have prevented him from executing the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. When The Des Moines Register published an interactive map allowing readers to identify schools that did not have security guards in 2013, Conway declared that they had provided  a shopping list for every nut job in Iowa. Conway has been an opponent of camera-generating traffic tickets stating in 2014:  The cameras are about money and only money. Cameras have absolutely nothing to do with safety, and the devices actually cause wrecks. If yellow-light times were increased by one second, wrecks at those intersections can be reduced by 50 percent. Following Iowa's move to increase the gas tax by 10 cents a gallon in 2015, Conway urged his listeners to re-register as independents and  ditch the GOP .",

After questions arose surrounding the 2020 presidential election results, Conway stated:  It seems we are destined to go through this now, however, where our country is split in half. And four years ago, about half the country said,  We don't trust these results. And now, we ve got about half the country saying,  We don't trust these results. It's really dangerous for the republic, right? In 2020 Conway stated live on air that vaccinations cause autism in children, while interviewing a childhood pediatrician. Conway claimed numerous times in 2021 that facemasks do not work, despite providing no credible sources. He also conflates masking children in school with  child abuse . After the conviction of the Mollie Tibbets killer, Conway reaffirmed his beliefs on deportation and removal of illegal immigrants, despite (and stating this on his show) the wishes of Tibbets parents to not make her death about race or citizenship.",

According to the mission statement on their website, New Grounds is  dedicated to providing artists with a professional, informative, safer and well-equipped environment for the creation of fine prints while promoting the artists and exhibiting their work. Origins and goals\nNew Grounds was founded in response to three particular needs: \nThe need for a printmaking center in Albuquerque offering classes, press and studio access to all artists working in intaglio and relief printmaking. The need to educate the general public about printmaking by offering studio tours, lectures and exhibitions. The need for this facility to be nontoxic. At that time all printmaking constituted a high health risk to artists in addition to having a negative impact on the environment. A good definition of nontoxic, or green printmaking, can be found on Friedhard Kiekeben's website, NontoxicPrint.com:  the term nontoxic non-toxic has become synonymous with safety-conscious practice. Nontoxic processes still use a variety of chemicals, and the ultimate safety of any material and process is dependent on their informed use.",

New Grounds utilized the research of the innovators Keith Howard and Mark Zaffron to build a completely green studio, and, according to a research paper written by Liz Chalfin from Zea Mays Printmaking studio, New Grounds was one of the first nontoxic printmaking studios in the United States. It all began with a non-toxic studio in her remodeled South Valley garage, where artists would rent press access on an hourly basis and Held taught classes. At that time, New Grounds also offered papermaking classes and access to the papermaking studio. In 2000, Regina expanded to the current 3500 square foot commercial space in Nob Hill. Now, more than five years later, New Grounds includes a thriving gallery that represents member and international artists whose works Regina consigns. It is also a shared workspace where resident artists have the use of two large print rooms, five presses, comfortable work and storage areas, a break room, and areas in which to shoot photographic plates for gravures and to etch plates for intaglio prints. Another entire room, with its own press, is devoted to classes, where everything from monotype to the alternative process, gumoil printing, is taught.

Mathiez emphasized class conflict. He argued that 1789 pitted the bourgeoisie against the aristocracy and then the Revolution pitted the bourgeoisie against the sans-culottes, who were a proletariat-in-the-making. Mathiez greatly influenced Georges Lefebvre and Albert Soboul in forming what came to be known as the orthodox Marxist interpretation of the Revolution. Mathiez admired Maximilien Robespierre, praised the Reign of Terror and did not extend complete sympathy to the struggle of the proletariat. Career\nMathiez came from a peasant family in Eastern France, being born in La Bruyère, Haute-Saône. He showed high intelligence as a young student, with a strong interest in history. He entered the École Normale Supérieure in 1894, by which time he had already displayed a strong anti-clerical bias. After graduation, he passed the aggregation in history and after doing his military service entered the teaching profession. He taught at a variety of local lycèes until he completed his doctorate which he wrote under the direction of François Victor Alphonse Aulard, then the leading historian of the Revolution, who admired Georges Danton.",

At first a good friend of Aulard, he broke with his mentor in 1907, founding his own society, the Société des études robespierristes, with its journal, the Annales révolutionnaires. He also moved up from the lycée to the university level, teaching at Besançon and Dijon. Earlier a pacifist, Mathiez developed into a nationalistic Jacobin after the World War I erupted in 1914. He used his scholarship on the Revolution to demonstrate that just as Revolutionary France had defeated the allied coalition in the 1790s, so too the Third Republic would triumph over Imperial Germany. With its serious economic and social stresses such as shortages of food and rationing, the war prompted him to study similar conditions during the Revolution. The eventual result was one of his most original works, La Vie chère et le movement social sous la Terreur (1927). In his masterwork La Révolution française (3 vol. 1922 1924), Mathiez boldly made Maximilien Robespierre the hero.",

Émile Durkheim's work in the sociology of religion influenced his interpretation of the 1790s. Mathiez saw the French Revolution as the critical first stage in a proletarian advance that would gather strength in the revolutions of 1848, the Paris Commune of 1871 and the Russian revolts of 1905 and reached its highest point during the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution in Russia which created a dictatorship in the name of the proletariat. Mathiez rejected the common view of Robespierre as demagogic, dictatorial and fanatical. Mathiez argued he was an eloquent spokesman for the poor and oppressed, an enemy of royalist intrigues, a vigilant adversary of dishonest and corrupt politicians, a guardian of the French Republic, an intrepid leader of the French Revolutionary government and a prophet of a socially responsible state. Mathiez held the highly prestigious Sorbonne chair in French Revolutionary Studies and was the founder of the Societe des Etudes Robespierristes which led to the creation in 1908 of the highly regarded journal Annales révolutionnaries that became Annales historiques de la Révolution française in 1924.

    "text": "The SCNN1B gene encodes for the β subunit of the epithelial sodium channel ENaC in vertebrates. ENaC is assembled as a heterotrimer composed of three homologous subunits α, β, and γ or δ, β, and γ. The other ENAC subunits are encoded by SCNN1A, SCNN1G, and SCNN1D. ENaC is expressed in epithelial cells and is different from the voltage-gated sodium channel that is involved in the generation of action potentials in neurons. The abbreviation for the genes encoding for voltage-gated sodium channel starts with three letters: SCN. In contrast to these sodium channels, ENaC is constitutively active and is not voltage-dependent. The second N in the abbreviation (SCNN1A) represents that these are NON-voltage-gated channels. In most vertebrates, sodium ions are the major determinant of the osmolarity of the extracellular fluid. ENaC allows transfer of sodium ions across the epithelial cell membrane in so-called  tight-epithelia  that have low permeability. The flow of sodium ions across epithelia affects osmolarity of the extracellular fluid. Thus, ENaC plays a central role in the regulation of body fluid and electrolyte homeostasis and consequently affects blood pressure.",

Thus, ENaC plays a central role in the regulation of body fluid and electrolyte homeostasis and consequently affects blood pressure. As ENaC is strongly inhibited by amiloride, it is also referred to as an  amiloride-sensitive sodium channel . History\nThe first cDNA encoding the beta subunit of ENaC was cloned and sequenced by Canessa et al. from rat mRNA. A year later, two independent groups reported the cDNA sequences of the beta- and gamma-subunits of the human ENaC. The exon-intron organization of the human beta ENaC gene SCNN1B was determined by Saxena et al. by sequencing genomic DNA from three subjects from three different ethnic groups. This study also established that the exon-intron architecture of the three subunits of ENaC have remained highly conserved despite the divergence of their sequences. Gene structure\nWhile the human gene SCNN1A is located in chromosome 12p, the human genes encoding SCNN1B and SCNN1G are located in juxtaposition in the short arm of chromosome 16 (16p12-p13). Sequencing of the human genomic DNA indicated that the SCNN1B gene has 13 exons separated by 12 introns.",

The positions of introns are conserved in all three human ENaC genes, SCNN1A, SCNN1B and SCNN1G. The positions of the introns are also highly conserved across vertebrates. See: Ensembl GeneTree. Analysis of transcripts of the SCNN1B gene in human kidney and lung showed several alternative transcription and translation initiation sites. However, only one of these transcripts (ENST00000343070) is highly expressed and other transcripts appear at low amounts. Tissue-specific expression\nThe three ENaC subunits encoded by SCNN1A, SCNN1B, and SCNN1G are commonly expressed in tight epithelia that have low water permeability. The major organs where ENaC is expressed include parts of the kidney tubular epithelia, the respiratory airway, the female reproductive tract, colon, salivary and sweat glands. ENaC is also expressed in the tongue, where it has been shown to be essential for the perception of salt taste. The expression of ENaC subunit genes is regulated mainly by the mineralocorticoid hormone aldosterone that is activated by the renin-angiotensin system.

    "text": "Protein structure\nThe primary structures of all four ENaC subunits show strong similarity. Thus, these four proteins represent a family of proteins that share a common ancestor. In global alignment (meaning alignments of sequences along their entire length and not just a partial segment), the human β subunit shares 34  identity with the γ subunit and 26 and 23  identity with the α and δ subunits. All four ENaC subunit sequences have two hydrophobic stretches that form two transmembrane segments named as TM1 and TM2. In the membrane-bound form, the TM segments are embedded in the membrane bilayer, the amino- and carboxy-terminal regions are located inside the cell, and the segment between the two TMs remains outside of the cell as the extracellular region of ENaC. This extracellular region includes about 70  of the residues of each subunit. Thus, in the membrane-bound form, the bulk of each subunit is located outside of the cell. The structure of ENaC has not been yet determined. Yet, the structure of a homologous protein ASIC1 has been resolved. The chicken ASIC1 structure revealed that ASIC1 is assembled as a homotrimer of three identical subunits. The authors of the original study suggested that each ASIC1 subunit resembles a hand holding a ball.",

The authors of the original study suggested that each ASIC1 subunit resembles a hand holding a ball. Hence distinct domains of ASIC1 have been referred to as palm, knuckle, finger, thumb, and β-ball. Alignment of ENaC subunit sequences with ASIC1 sequence reveals that TM1 and TM2 segments and palm domain are conserved, and the knuckle, finger and thumb domains have insertions in ENaC. Site-directed mutagenesis studies on ENaC subunits provide evidence that many basic features of the ASIC1 structural model apply to ENaC as well. Yet, ENaC is an obligate heterotrimer composed of three subunits as an αβγ or a βγδ trimer. In the carboxy terminus of three ENaC subunits, (α, β and γ) there is a special conserved consensus sequence PPPXYXXL that is called the PY motif. This sequence is recognized by the so-called WW domains in a special E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase named Nedd4-2. Nedd4-2 ligates ubiquitin to the C-terminus of the ENaC subunit which marks the protein for degradation.

Multi-system form of type I pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA1B)\nThe disease most commonly associated with mutations in SCNN1B is the multi-system form of type I pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA1B) that was first characterized by A. Hanukoglu as an autosomal recessive disease. This is a syndrome of unresponsiveness to aldosterone in patients that have high serum levels of aldosterone but suffer from symptoms of aldosterone deficiency with a high risk of mortality due to severe salt loss. Initially, this disease was thought to be a result of a mutation in the mineralocorticoid receptor (NR3C2) that binds aldosterone. But homozygosity mapping in 11 affected families revealed that the disease is associated with two loci on chromosome 12p13.1-pter and chromosome 16p12.2-13 that include the genes for SCNN1A and SCNN1B and SCNN1G respectively.",

    "text": "Sequencing of the ENaC genes identified mutation in affected patients, and functional expression of the mutated cDNAs further confirmed that identified mutations lead to the loss of activity of ENaC. In the majority of the patients with multi-system PHA1B a homozygous mutation or two compound heterozygous mutations have been detected. Liddle syndrome\nLiddle syndrome is generally caused by mutations in the PY motif or truncation of the C-terminus including loss of the PY motif in the β or γ ENaC subunits. Even though there is a PY motif also in the α subunit, so far Liddle disease has not observed in association with a mutation in the α subunit. Liddle syndrome is inherited as an autosomal dominant disease with a phenotype that includes early onset hypertension, metabolic alkalosis and low levels of plasma renin activity and mineralocorticoid hormone aldosterone. In the absence of a recognizable PY motif, ubiquitin-protein ligase Nedd4-2 cannot bind to the ENaC subunit and hence cannot attach a ubiquitin to it. Consequently, proteolysis of ENaC by proteasome is inhibited and ENaC accumulates in the membrane leading to enhanced activity of ENaC that causes hypertension.

    "text": "The Cowboy in Me  is a song written by Jeffrey Steele, Al Anderson and Craig Wiseman, and recorded by American country music artist Tim McGraw. It was released in November 2001 as the third single from McGraw's Set This Circus Down album. The song reached number one on the Billboard Hot Country Singles   Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts just one week after McGraw's duet with Jo Dee Messina,  Bring On the Rain . Critical reception\nKevin John Coyne of Country Universe gave the song a B grade, saying that the song  might be an amoebic form of the country lifestyle anthems that have flooded the genre in the years since it was released. He added that it is  certainly subtler and more refined than what s come out since, and McGraw s hit doesn t include the head-pounding loudness that sinks so many other 'country' anthems. In a subsequent review, Coyne upgraded the song to an A, as he thought the song's message had become more relevant with increasing age. Music video\nThe music video was directed by Sherman Halsey and was released in early 2002.

The species is generally regarded as widespread, although uncommon, in New South Wales, Queensland, northern Western Australia and the Northern Territory, and classified as Vulnerable in Victoria. The red-chested buttonquail is a small reddish-brown, ground-running bird, which avoids flying. The female is brighter and slightly larger in size and weight. The female is polyandrous, initiating courtship among several males and expelling rival females from her territory. Taxonomy\nThe red-chested buttonquail was originally described by ornithologist John Gould in 1841, Aberdeen, New South Wales, Australia. It was originally named Hemipodius pyrrhothorax. The red-chested buttonquail belongs to the bird family Turnicidae, which resemble, but are unrelated to the Quail or Phasianidae. There are 17 species in the family Turnicidae, with two genera, Turnix and Ortyxelos. The red-chested buttonquail belongs to the genus Turnix.

Similar species\nThe red-chested buttonquail is most easily distinguished by its uniformed grey-brown tone on its upper side and orange chestnut flakes. While the little buttonquail (Turnix velox) can be recognised by its distinctly reddish-brown or pinkish toned under-body and the contrasting tones between parts of its wings.

Foraging occurs throughout the day, although the species has been said to be nocturnal and crepuscular. They make platelets while foraging, which is typical for the genus Turnix. They glean and scratch in leaf litter, while rotating on the spot by pivoting on one foot and raking with the other.

The red-chested buttonquails are solitary breeders and females are sequentially polyandrous. The female usually constructs the nest and it is depression lined with grass, hooked, and shelter by grass tussock. Eggs are laid in February July September in the north, and September February in the south. Usually four white eggs with chestnut-brown markings are laid at one- or two-day intervals. Incubation lasts 13 18 days from completion of clutch. Males incubate and care for chicks alone. Chicks leave the nest precocial and nidifugous. They are grey-brown with dark and pale dorsal stripes. They reach adult size in 6 8 weeks and adult-like plumage at 2 3 months. They reach sexual maturity at 6 months.

Vocalization and communication\nThe female is known to display a repetitive advertising call of  oom  note, which increases in pitch and intensity. Disturbed birds utter a sharp chattering call. Adults are also known to communicate various soft whistles and chirrups. Juvenile birds have a weak, domestic, chicken-like call if handled. Migration\nRed-chested buttonquails are partial migrants. Red-chested buttonquails are known to have seasonal migration between inland arid regions to semi-arid areas nearer the coast, from winter to spring and summer. Some populations remain in one region all year round. The amount of movement is influenced by factors such as rainfall, plant growth and food availability. In captivity\nIn captivity, if the enclosure is too small, the red-chested buttonquail is known to become aggressive. Males may fight each other's offspring, while females may kill offspring of other females, so that the male will re-mate. Conservation status and threats\nThe red-chested buttonquail is classified as Least concern by the IUCN. It is not listed as threatened by the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, but its conservation status varies from state to state within Australia. It is listed as  threatened  by the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act (1988).",

Under this Act, an Action Statement for the recovery and future management of this species has not yet been prepared. On the 2007 advisory list of threatened vertebrate fauna in Victoria, the red-chested buttonquail is listed as vulnerable. The red-chested buttonquail is thought to be uncommon but secure throughout the rest of its Australian range. This species was formerly hunted for food and sport, and occasionally killed by feral pests for example cats and foxes. The major threat to this species is loss of suitable habitat. This species has not adapted to crop and farmland habitats to the extent of many other Buttonquail species. Red-chested buttonquail who nest in crops have been known to lose their clutches due to harvesting. This species generally ranges from uncommon to locally common, with densities of 0 2 5 birds ha reported. In the northern parts of its distribution range the species is frequent or at least widespread, but considered to be only sparsely distributed over much of Queensland, especially in coastal areas. In the southern parts of its distribution range the species is declining or suspected to be declining. The species is very uncommon in South Australia, infrequently recorded in New South Wales (where threatened in west of state) and very few records in Victoria.",

Adapted, produced and directed by Dorothea Brooking, it was first broadcast on BBC 1 in seven 30-minute episodes. This is the only BBC adaptation of the novel known to exist in its entirety. The 1952 adaptation is missing all eight episodes and the 1960 adaptation is missing three of its eight episodes. Plot\nThe series begins as Mary Lennox (played by Sarah Hollis Andrews) is abandoned by her parents and native attendants at her home in India due to a devastating outbreak of cholera. After the decease of her mother and father, she is discovered to be the only survivor by English colonist soldiers. She is sent to her uncle Archibald Craven's residence, Misselthwaite Manor in Yorkshire, England, to become his ward. As she gradually becomes accustomed to her new surroundings, she befriends her maid Martha and Martha's brother Dickon. One night, upon hearing distant crying, Mary leaves her room to investigate and discovers her cousin, Colin. Colin is an invalid and bedridden, avoided by his father, demanding and hysterical and convinced that he will develop a hunchback like his father and die an early death.

Nelly Kilpatrick has been suggested as being Burns's first romantic love, but some significant doubts exist about the true identity of this individual. It was thought to be a Nelly Blair until Burns's sister Isabella gave the name Nelly Kilpatrick, however Isobel was only three years old at the time of Burns's association with Nelly and some doubt must be cast on her recollections at this stage in her life. Life and character\nBurns stated that Nelly had a sweet voice and was wont to sing songs as she worked in the fields. The first reference to Nelly's identity by the Reverend Hamilton Paul of Ayr in 1819 records that:  This nymph was afterwards married to a Carrick farmer, and became the mother of many sons and daughters, and who, when we saw her in 1811, still retained the characteristics of sonsieness, which so fascinated her helpmate in the work of the harvest as to betray him into the sin of rhyme.

    "text": "A spillway is a structure used to provide the controlled release of water from a dam or levee, typically downstream into the dammed river. In the United Kingdom, it may be known as an overflow channel. A spillway ensures that water does not damage parts of the structure not designed to convey water. Spillways can include floodgates and fuse plugs to regulate water flow and reservoir level. Such features enable a spillway to regulate downstream flow, allowing dam operators to release water in a controlled manner before the reservoir is full, thereby preventing an unacceptably large release later. Other uses of the term  spillway  include bypasses of dams and outlets of channels used during high water, and outlet channels carved through natural dams such as moraines. Water normally flows over a spillway only during flood periods, when the reservoir has reached its capacity and water continues entering faster than it can be released through penstocks or intake towers used to control water release on a routine basis for purposes such as water supply for irrigation and hydroelectricity generation. Types\nA spillway is located near the top of the reservoir pool. Dams may also have bottom outlets with valves or gates which may be operated to release flood flow, and a few dams lack overflow spillways and rely entirely on bottom outlets. The two main types of spillways are controlled and uncontrolled. A controlled spillway has mechanical structures or gates to regulate the rate of flow.",

    "text": "The two main types of spillways are controlled and uncontrolled. A controlled spillway has mechanical structures or gates to regulate the rate of flow. This design allows nearly the full height of the dam to be used for water storage year-round, and flood waters can be released as required by opening one or more gates. An uncontrolled spillway, in contrast, does not have gates; when the water rises above the lip or crest of the spillway, it begins to be released from the reservoir. The rate of discharge is controlled only by the height of water above the reservoir's spillway. The fraction of storage volume in the reservoir above the spillway crest can only be used for the temporary storage of floodwater; it cannot be used as water supply storage because it sits higher than the dam can retain it. In an intermediate type, normal level regulation of the reservoir is controlled by the mechanical gates. In this case, the dam is not designed to function with water flowing over the top if it, either due to the materials used for its construction or conditions directly downstream. If inflow to the reservoir exceeds the gate's capacity, an artificial channel called an auxiliary or emergency spillway will convey water. Often, that is intentionally blocked by a fuse plug. If present, the fuse plug is designed to wash out in case of a large flood greater than the discharge capacity of the spillway gates.",

The fuse plug concept is used where building a spillway with the required capacity would be costly. Open channel spillway\nChute spillway\nA chute spillway is a common and basic design that transfers excess water from behind the dam down a smooth decline into the river below. These are usually designed following an ogee curve. Most often, they are lined on the bottom and sides with concrete to protect the dam and topography. They may have a controlling device and some are thinner and multiply-lined if space and funding are tight. In addition, they are not always intended to dissipate energy like stepped spillways. Chute spillways can be ingrained with a baffle of concrete blocks but usually have a  flip lip  and or dissipator basin, which creates a hydraulic jump, protecting the toe of the dam from erosion.

Despite being superseded by more modern engineering techniques such as hydraulic jumps in the mid twentieth century, since around 1985 interest in stepped spillways and chutes has been renewed, partly due to the use of new construction materials (e.g. roller-compacted concrete, gabions) and design techniques (e.g. embankment overtopping protection). The steps produce considerable energy dissipation along the chute and reduce the size of the required downstream energy dissipation basin. Research is still active on the topic, with newer developments on embankment dam overflow protection systems, converging spillways and small-weir design. Bell-mouth spillway\nA bell-mouth spillway is designed like an inverted bell, where water can enter around the entire perimeter. These uncontrolled spillways are also called morning glory (after the flower), glory hole, or shaft spillways. In areas where the surface of the reservoir may freeze, this type of spillway is normally fitted with ice-breaking arrangements to prevent the spillway from becoming ice-bound. Some bell-mouth spillways are gate-controlled. The highest morning glory spillway in the world is at Hungry Horse Dam in Montana, U.S., and is controlled by a 64-by-12-foot (19.5 by 3.7 m) ring gate.",

The largest bell-mouth spillway is in Geehi Dam, in New South Wales, Australia, measuring 105 ft (32 m) in diameter at the lake's surface. Siphon spillway\nA siphon spillway uses the difference in height between the intake and the outlet to create the pressure difference required to remove excess water. Siphons require priming to remove air in the bend for them to function, and most siphon spillways are designed to use water to automatically prime the siphon. One such design is the volute siphon, which employs volutes, or fins, on a funnel to form water into a vortex that draws air out of the system. The priming happens automatically when the water level rises above the inlets. Other types\nThe ogee crest over-tops a dam, a side channel wraps around the topography of a dam, and a labyrinth uses a zig-zag design to increase the sill length for a thinner design and increased discharge. A drop inlet resembles an intake for a hydroelectric power plant and transfers water from behind the dam directly through tunnels to the river downstream. Design considerations\nOne parameter of spillway design is the largest flood it is designed to handle.",

    "text": "A drop inlet resembles an intake for a hydroelectric power plant and transfers water from behind the dam directly through tunnels to the river downstream. Design considerations\nOne parameter of spillway design is the largest flood it is designed to handle. The structures must safely withstand the appropriate spillway design flood (SDF), sometimes called the inflow design flood (IDF). The magnitude of the SDF may be set by dam safety guidelines, based on the size of the structure and the potential loss of human life or property downstream. The magnitude of the flood is sometimes expressed as a return period. A 100-year recurrence interval is the flood magnitude expected to be exceeded on the average of once in 100 years. This parameter may be expressed as an exceedance frequency with a 1  chance of being exceeded in any given year. The volume of water expected during the design flood is obtained by hydrologic calculations of the upstream watershed. The return period is set by dam safety guidelines, based on the size of the structure and the potential loss of human life or property downstream. The United States Army Corps of Engineers bases their requirements on the probable maximum flood (PMF) and the probable maximum precipitation (PMP). The PMP is the largest precipitation thought to be physically possible in the upstream watershed. Dams of lower hazard may be allowed to have an IDF less than the PMF.

Energy dissipation\nAs water passes over a spillway and down the chute, potential energy converts into increasing kinetic energy. Failure to dissipate the water's energy can lead to scouring and erosion at the dam's toe (base). This can cause spillway damage and undermine the dam's stability. To put this energy in perspective, the spillways at Tarbela Dam could, at full capacity, produce 40,000 MW; about 10 times the capacity of its power plant. The energy can be dissipated by addressing one or more parts of a spillway's design. Steps\nFirst, on the spillway surface itself by a series of steps along the spillway (see stepped spillway). Flip bucket\nSecond, at the base of a spillway, a flip bucket can create a hydraulic jump and deflect water upwards. Ski jump\nA ski jump can direct water horizontally and eventually down into a plunge pool, or two ski jumps can direct their water discharges to collide with one another.

A number of velocity-reducing components can be incorporated into their design to include chute blocks, baffle blocks, wing walls, surface boils, or end sills. Safety\nSpillway gates may operate suddenly without warning, under remote control. Trespassers within the spillway are at high risk of drowning. Spillways are usually fenced and equipped with locked gates to prevent casual trespassing within the structure. Warning signs, sirens, and other measures may be in place to warn users of the downstream area of sudden release of water. Operating protocols may require  cracking  a gate to release a small amount of water to warn persons downstream. The sudden closure of a spillway gate can result in the stranding of fish, and this is usually avoided.

Since its first mentioning in 1170 until 1807 1815, the castle or the later Rheda Castle was the center of the Rheda ruling region (the County of Bentheim-Tecklenburg-Rheda). Wiedenbrück was the seat of the Office Reckenberg and thus an exclave of the Bishopric of Osnabrück. Emperor Otto granted the rights of market, coin and customs law for Wiedenbrück to the bishop of Osnabrück in the year 952. Several certificates issued by Otto III (HRE) in Wiedenbrück in 985 are known. It is therefore assumed that a royal court existed in Wiedenbrück at that time. In 1225 bishop Engelbert of Osnabrück took over the ancient legal court responsibility for Wiedenbrück and other cities. This is one of the starting points of the development of the Bishopric of Osnabrück to a territorial state of the Bishop of Osnabrück. The oldest surviving coins from Wiedenbrück are dated 1230. In 1231 Wiedenbrück was proclaimed civitas. Aldermen were elected to the Court and a seal was announced.

By 1565 Wiedenbrück was predominantly Lutheran. In the same year the boundaries between the Office Reckenberg to which Wiedenbrück counted, and the adjacent Rheda were established in the so-called Bielefeld recess, as two independent sovereign areas were first recognized. After first steps for a Counter-Reformation were taken in 1624 1625, Wiedenbrück was occupied in 1626 during the Thirty Years' War by the Danes . When the Bishop Franz Wilhelm von Wartenberg assumed office in 1628, he continued the Counter-Reformation. In 1637 Wiedenbrück established one of the oldest high schools in the region, the Gymnasium Marianum, a Latin School and forerunner of the current Ratsgymnasium high school in Wiedenbrück.

Three years later, in July 1647 Wiedenbrück was taken by the Swedes, but cleared after dismantling of the fortress within two months. When in 1648 in Münster and Osnabrück the Peace of Westphalia was negotiated, this did require the alternation of a Catholic and a Lutheran bishop in the House of Brunswick-Lüneburg for the Bishopric of Osnabrück. In 1664, prompted by Ernst August I., the refortification of the city began. In 1716 the last urban copper coins were minted. In 1726, a new office building was constructed on the Reckenberg. As a result of the conversion of bishopric Osnabrück into a principality, Wiedenbrück was attached to the house of Hanover in 1802. In 1807 the city became part of the Kingdom of Westphalia. The chapter of fellows of collegiate was disbanded in 1810, and the Office Reckenberg with Wiedenbrück were ceded to Prussia at the Congress of Vienna in 1816 and assigned to the new province of Westphalia.

She left the production for film work, but after being away from the production for eight months, Ellen Greene, who was playing the part of Jenny, fell ill. Brown astounded the stage manager of the production by coming in and, with one hour of rehearsal, put on a  brilliant  performance as Jenny. Her first major appearance on Broadway came in 1989, in the play Secret Rapture, written by David Hare. Once  Molly Dodd  concluded, Brown became a prolific Broadway actress, appearing in, among other productions, Tom Stoppard's 1995 Lincoln Center Theater production of Arcadia and two separate runs as Frau Schneider in the revival of Cabaret (1998 and 2003).",

    "text": "Theta Librae is a single star in the southern zodiac constellation of Libra, near the constellation border with Scorpius. Its name is a Bayer designation that is Latinized from θ Librae, and abbreviated Theta Lib or θ Lib. It is visible to the naked eye as a faint, orange-hued star with an apparent visual magnitude of 4.14. The distance to this star is approximately 168 light years, as determined by parallax, and it is drifting further away with a radial velocity of 5 km s. The position of this star near the ecliptic means it is subject to lunar occultations. This object is an aging giant star with a stellar classification of G9IIIb. Having exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core, it has cooled and expanded; at present it has 12.3 times the girth of the Sun. The star has an estimated mass about 47  greater than the Sun. It is radiating about 68 times the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of about 4,739 K. It is probably on the red giant branch, which indicates it is generating energy through hydrogen fusion in a shell outside an inert helium core. However, there is a 41  chance that it is a red clump giant on the horizontal branch, which would mean it was somewhat older and less massive.",

The brigades were created as part of efforts to unify the party-based Peshmerga forces under a more centralized command. Numbering several dozen brigades, they are formally under the authority of the Kurdistan Regional Government's (KRG) Ministry of Peshmerga Affairs (MoPA), though in practice many remain aligned with the two dominant Kurdish political parties, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). The Regional Guard Brigades have been deployed most notably in the War against the Islamic State (ISIS) from 2014 onward. History\nEstablishment of the MoPA\nThe MoPA was established following the creation of the autonomous Kurdistan Region in Iraq in the early 1990s as an attempt to place the Peshmerga under a unified civilian authority. Based on the 50-50 power sharing principle the KDP and PUK passed Law No. 5 transforming the Peshmerga into a regular armed force under the MoPA and prohibiting political parties from maintaining private militias.",

This lack of centralized control became evident during the Kurdish civil war (1994 1997), when the two parties used their separate Peshmerga forces against each other. After the conflict, the 1998 Washington Agreement, the 2006 KRG unifcation agreement following the Fall of Saddam Hussein, and the organisational reunification of the parties  separate Peshmerga ministries in 2009, the MoPA was gradually revitalized.

The list won four seats, and he was assigned a mandate. (From 1992 to 2000, Serbia's electoral law stipulated that one-third of parliamentary mandates would be assigned to candidates from successful lists in numerical order, while the remaining two-thirds would be distributed amongst other candidates on the lists at the discretion of the sponsoring parties. It was common practice for the latter mandates to be awarded out of order. Avramov did not automatically receive a mandate by virtue of his list position.) The Radical Party won eighty-two seats in total, finishing second against the governing Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS). The SPS formed a new coalition government with the SRS and the Yugoslav Left (JUL) in March 1998, and Avramov served as a supporter of the administration. He was one of several Serbian officials placed under sanction by European Union countries in March 2000, in the aftermath of the Kosovo War and the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. SPS leader Slobodan Milošević was defeated by Democratic Opposition of Serbia candidate Vojislav Koštunica in the 2000 Yugoslavian presidential election, a watershed moment in Serbian and Yugoslavian politics. The Serbian government fell, and the Radicals moved into opposition in the Serbian assembly.",

    "text": "Hanosaurus is an extinct genus of marine reptiles that existed during the Triassic period in what is now China. The type species is Hanosaurus hupehensis. It was a small animal, with specimens measuring 79.4 cm (31.3 in) long in total body length, which likely fed on soft-bodied prey. Discovery\nHanosaurus (lizard of Han River) was discovered from the Sonshugo locality of Hubei, China. It was found at the second member of the Jialingjiang Formation. The type specimen consisted of a skull, complete hindlimbs and pelvis, incomplete shoulder girdle represented by coracoid and clavicle, and an articulated but incomplete vertebral column. It was initially described as a thalattosaur but subsequent research showed it was more likely to be a sauropterygia. A more complete referred specimen was described in 2022 from the Yingzishan locality of Hubei, China. The specimen was also found at the second member of the Jialingjiang formation. It consisted of almost the entire skeleton preserved with its ventral side up. However, a later study has cast doubt on the referral of this specimen to Hanosaurus.

I get the notes late Friday afternoon for the following Thursday morning. I find all the spare time I can for reading, get up very early on a Thursday morning, have a final two hours of nervousness, and away we go. Bragg hosts discussion of the week's subject featuring what he has characterised as  three absolutely top-class academics  on the subject. The programme is normally broadcast live and unedited on Thursday mornings at 9 a.m., lasting around 42 minutes, and is then available online. He begins each episode with a short summary of the week's topic, then introduces the three guests. He guides the discussion along a generally chronological route, then either concludes the programme himself or invites summation remarks from one of the specialists. Bragg gives short shrift to pretension of any kind, while remaining stalwart in his search for knowledge. His methodology in In Our Time is... not unlike that of a man throwing a stick for a dog: he chucks his questions ahead, and if the chosen academic fails to bring it right back, he chides them.

History\nIn Our Time was conceived for Bragg in 1998 after he was forced to quit his decade-long role as presenter for Start the Week due to a perceived conflict of interest arising from his appointment as a Labour life peer. He was offered the Thursday  death-slot  and decided he would  do what  he  always wanted to do,  and  hastily battered out a simple idea  with producer Olivia Seligman expecting the show would only last a few months. By September 1999, he had taken a time slot that was previously attracting an audience of 600,000 and grown it to 1.5 million. By 2000, the half-hour show was expanded to 45 minutes and to include three guest speakers. In 2004, the programme was made available as a podcast from the BBC website and iTunes for one week after broadcast. Until July 2014, listeners could also sign up for weekly email newsletters from Bragg, where he mentioned any additional information relating to the programme, along with snippets from his own personal and intellectual life. In 2009, selected transcripts of episodes from the programme were compiled in the book In Our Time: A Companion to the Radio 4 series, edited by Bragg.",

    "text": "Glace Bay is a community in the eastern part of the Cape Breton Regional Municipality in Nova Scotia, Canada. It forms part of the general area referred to as Industrial Cape Breton. Formerly an incorporated town (1901 1995), the municipal government in Glace Bay was dissolved and the community was amalgamated into the larger regional municipality. Prior to amalgamation, Glace Bay had been the province's fourth largest urban area and the largest town in Nova Scotia by population. Neighbouring communities include Reserve Mines, Dominion, and Tower Road. History\nAs early as the 1720s, the French inhabited the area to supply Fortress of Louisbourg with coal. They named the location baie de Glace (literally, Bay of Ice) because of the sea ice which filled the ocean each winter. In 1748, after the capture of Fortress Louisbourg, the British constructed Fort William at Table Head in order to protect a mine that produced coal to supply the Louisbourg garrison. The fort itself was a blockhouse, brought from Boston, with a palisade. When Cape Breton Island was returned to French control, Fort William continued in service until 1752 when it was destroyed by fire. More permanent settlement of Glace Bay probably can be dated from 1818 when Walter Blackett obtained a grant of land on the south side of the Bay.",

Coal mining existed on a small scale until the 1860s, when four mines were in operation within the future town boundaries. These included the Hub, Harbour, Caledonia and Glace Bay Collieries. The first large mine, the Hub Shaft of Glace Bay opened in 1861 and a total of 12 mines in Glace Bay were in operation. Following the formation of the Dominion Coal Company in 1893, the coal mining industry expanded significantly in what was to become Glace Bay with the opening of several new mines. In 1894, the government gave exclusive mining rights to the Dominion Coal Company. Small communities grew up around the mines and by 1901 they came together to form the Town of Glace Bay. At the time of incorporation, the population was 6,945. During the early 20th century, mining companies recruited in the American South for workers, attracting African Americans from Mississippi. By the 1940s, the figure exceeded 28,000 and Glace Bay became Canada's largest town (in population). At one time, the town had 12 collieries but none remains. Because of this industrial decline, jobs left and the core population decreased to 16,984 as of 2001.",

In 1860, the Glace Bay Mining Company was formed and it operated two mines. The first large colliery, the Hub Shaft, opened in 1861. Large-scale mining commenced in 1893 after exclusive mining rights were granted to the Dominion Coal Company. Glace Bay was incorporated as a town on January 18, 1901. At its high point the company operated eleven mines in all, and was responsible for 40  of Canada's coal production. Coal was transported on the Sydney and Louisburg Railway to both of those ports for shipping. The S   L Railway's main operations, including the roundhouse and machine shops were located in Glace Bay. Glace Bay's extensive coal and rail operations made the town the industrial center of Cape Breton. As coal mining became less important, the mines were closed until, in 1984 Colliery No. 26 was closed by the Cape Breton Development Corporation.",

Many residents of Glace Bay started to work at the two other coal mines in the area: Prince Colliery in Point Aconi and Phalen Colliery and Lingan Colliery in Lingan. However, coal mining continued its decline with Lingan closing in the mid-1990s, followed by Phalen in 1999 and Prince in 2001. Fishing was also an important industry throughout the 20th century. However, by the 1990s fish stocks were so depleted that the fishery was closed. Some fish processing still occurs here. Present day\nThe former town of Glace Bay has a population of slightly fewer than 20,000 people. In 2001, a call centre operated by Stream Global Services, using post-industrialization subsidies, opened. The building is today owned by Concentrix. The Swiss mining consortium Xstrata was the primary partner in the Donkin Coal Development Alliance, which won the rights to develop an abandoned mine site in the nearby community of Donkin. Currently, the mine is owned by Kameron Collieries, a subsidiary of Cline Group LLC, which purchased the operation in 2014 2015. Coal production commenced in February 2016 and by the fall of 2018, the mine had 120 employees.",

Historical features and places\nMarconi National Historic Site\nThe Marconi National Historic Site of Canada is located at Table Head in Glace Bay. Parks Canada maintains an interpretive centre at the site honouring the role of Guglielmo Marconi in the development of radio communications. In December 1902, Marconi transmitted the first complete messages to Poldhu from stations at Glace Bay, Nova Scotia. Marconi chose this site for its elevated flat expanse and unobstructed view out over the ocean. Some of the concrete footings for the massive towers can still be seen on the grounds. Marconi built a much larger wireless site west of here then known as Marconi Towers. In 1907 he initiated the first permanent transatlantic wireless service from Marconi Towers to its companion site in Clifden, Ireland. Cape Breton Miners Museum\nThe Cape Breton Miners Museum is located on top of the Ocean Deep Colliery, which is only 1 kilometer from downtown Glace Bay. The museum is privately run and relies on donations and government grants for its operations. During the summer season, the museum offers a walking underground mine tour with a retired coal miner, and a virtual simulator tour of an underground mine. The museum is also home to The Men of the Deeps choir.",

Climate\nGlace Bay experiences a cool summer, and windy, wet and stormy winter, a version of a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfb) that is significantly moderated by the community's proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. The highest temperature ever recorded in Glace Bay was 36.7  C (98  F) on 18 August 1935. The lowest temperature ever recorded was  31.7  C ( 25  F) on 31 January 1873, 29 January 1877 and 15 February 1916. Because of its close proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, Glace Bay, like all of Cape Breton Island, experiences strong seasonal lag. The ocean does not reach its maximum temperature until mid August. It usually stays there until early September. This makes August the hottest month in Glace Bay rather than July which is usually the hottest in most northern continental climates.",

The union is the constituent body of the Rugby Football Union (RFU) for Staffordshire, and administers and organises rugby union clubs and competitions in the county. It also administers the Staffordshire county rugby representative teams. History\nAlthough there had been a number of long established clubs such as Burton (founded in 1870), Lichfield (1874) and Wolverhampton (1875), it took until 1923 for the Staffordshire Rugby Union to be formed, when it was part of the North Midlands Rugby Football Union. As the county started to find its identity in the 1920s more sides would start to form, with clubs such as Walsall (1921) and Stafford (1925) coming into existence during this period. Despite its formation in 1923, Staffordshire would not be recognised as a constituent body by the RFU until the 1960s. In 1961 a representative side defeated the reigning county champions Cheshire in a friendly match. This result showed the RFU that Staffordshire were ready to be included in the County Championships and the following year they would take part for the first time, being finally awarded constituent body status in 1962.",

The siblings decide against Danny staying as they conclude that he will only break their mother's heart in the end. John breaks the news to Danny, but lies to him by telling him it was their father who ultimately wanted him gone, rather than the siblings.

Danny's confrontation with his father inadvertently causes Robert to have mini-strokes, which eventually cause his death. The Rayburns' past is full of deep, dark secrets that are revealed throughout the season. Danny's dysfunctional relationship with his family primarily stems from the untimely death of his younger sister, Sarah, when he was a teenager. Danny took Sarah out on a boat. Her seahorse necklace fell into the water, and when she attempted to retrieve it, she drowned. Robert lost control and beat Danny severely, believing he was in some way responsible for her death. Sally covered up this abuse by pushing John, Kevin, and Meg to lie to the police about their brother's injuries, which they now claim were the result of Danny being hit by a drunk driver. Robert's death now opens the door for Danny to have a permanent job at the inn. Danny appears to be changing his ways with hard work and dedication, which puts him in Sally's good graces.

The investigation leads John directly to Danny and his recent activities. While secretly investigating Danny, John discovers Danny's smuggled cocaine in a shed on the Rayburn House property. During a meeting between John, Kevin, and Meg, the three siblings conclude that the only way to fix the situation and not put the family's business at risk with the Feds is to move the drugs to Danny's condo in Miami without telling Danny. The loss of the drugs puts Danny in a bad situation with Lowry, who believes that Danny has stolen the cocaine from him. Lowry sends a hitman to assassinate Danny, but Danny kills the hitman instead. Under pressure, Danny begins to act erratically. He tries to intimidate John by taking his daughter Jane out on a boat and giving her a seahorse necklace, similar to the one that belonged to their deceased sister, Sarah. John and his wife Diana take this as a threat against the family, so John sends his wife and children away for a few days.",

According to its official synopsis released by Netflix, Bloodline  centers on a close-knit family of four adult siblings whose secrets and scars are revealed when their black sheep brother returns home. The writing trio settled on the theme of family as they tried to determine what their next project would look like. According to Zelman,  Over the years we've found ourselves talking a lot about family and how family dynamics have changed   or not changed   as we've gotten older. Glenn Kessler added,  As we've hit our 40s, our understanding of our family dynamics has begun to change. And because we all come from families with three sons, we recognize the roles we play. It's something we'd been talking about. So the thought was, why not try to mine some of that in our creative life? They settled on a family-thriller genre, set in the Florida Keys, which explored the ghost of the past in family role formation. The pitch was attractive to a number of outlets before Netflix landed the drama as a 13-hour season to launch all at once   a structural advantage very important to the show's creators.",

Casting\nThe creators were intrigued by the idea of casting Kyle Chandler, whose on-screen persona in Friday Night Lights was warm and inviting, to play the ostensibly noble but deeply flawed John Rayburn. They met with Chandler in Austin, Texas, and pitched the part:  This is like an experiment. We're not quite sure if this is going to work the way we're doing it, but we want to try to create this family dynamic we're aware of and create this family around it. And their hesitancy of whether it would work or not... made me, thinking back on it, realize they were into it 110  because they were trying to create something new. I didn't know what would happen with it or where it could go... But I was like, I'm in. Ben Mendelsohn was the only actor whom the producers met with for the role of Danny Rayburn; they found his combination of intellect and acting ability perfectly suited to the part. Glenn Kessler was grateful for Netflix's hands-off approach to the decision, explaining,  They very much supported us finding the best actor that we thought could play the role.",

In addition, as much of the show's dramatic tension comes from the relationship between John and Danny, a certain chemistry between the two actors was vital. According to Chandler,   Mendelsohn 's so easy to work with. And yet, he's tricky   when you're working with him,  psychologically  there's so much going on. Linda Cardellini and Norbert Leo Butz secured their parts as siblings Meg and Kevin Rayburn, respectively, through meetings with the creators. According to Kessler, Sissy Spacek and Sam Shepard were described prior to casting as the  dream  actors they would want to play the Rayburn parents. A Damages fan, Spacek signed on after the cast started coming together, explaining,  There's so much good work coming out of television. I wanted to be a part of it.

Cinematographer Jaime Reynoso said,  he never saw  Bloodline  as a TV show , finding the all-at-once Netflix model useful in filming the series as if it were a shorter film. He explained,  The concept the writers had was they wanted it hyper-realistic, almost documentary style. He found first takes were often the best, with actors not rehearsing in order to maintain spontaneity. Bloodline editor Naomi Geraghty also stressed the importance of realism to the show:  Nobody is ever saying what they're saying, so part of how you build on that is by staying with those moments and you save sharp or jarring cuts for flashbacks.

The picturesque location of the Florida Keys, divided between gorgeous coral reefs and dark mangroves, is captured with an eye for the sensual and the symbolic.

The program is described by Autism Speaks as a  child-centered program that places parents as the key therapists and directors of their program . Parents are trained at the Kaufman's Autism Treatment Center of America, the division of The Option Institute in Sheffield, Massachusetts that teaches The Son-Rise Program. There, the Kaufman family and their fellow staff members teach families and professionals how to be aware of their attitudes a core principle of the therapy for bonding and relationship building, as well as creating a low-stimulus, distraction-free playroom, so the autistic child can feel secure and in control of the over-stimulation. Parents and facilitators imitate an autistic person's exclusive and restricted stimming behavior until the autistic person shows social cues for willing engagement. Then encouragement for more complex social activities is done in a non-coercive way. If the autistic person moves away from social interaction, the facilitator gives the autistic person their space by using parallel play to gain the child's or the adult's trust. To encourage skill acquisition, the program uses the autistic person's particular motivation for learning.",

The program's developers claim that if the parents learn to accept their loved one without judgement they will teach themselves to interact with others, and that this will allow them to engage in social interaction because they chose to learn the skills. A 2003 study found that involvement with the program led to more drawbacks than benefits for the involved families over time, though there was a strong correlation between patterns of intervention implementation and parental perceptions of intervention efficacy. A 2006 study found that the program is not always implemented as it is described in the literature, which means it will be difficult to evaluate its success and failure rate. History\nIn the 1970s, Barry and Samahria Kaufman created the treatment modality for their son, Raun, who had been diagnosed with severe autism. However, it remains unclear if Raun Kaufman had ever been autistic. Among the five clinics who evaluated the boy in New York State each describing him as  socially withdrawn and uncommunicative , it was only the sixth clinic that felt he was autistic. In 1976, Barry Neil Kaufman published Son-Rise, a book recounting his son's claimed recovery, which he self published in 1995 with the title Son-Rise: The Miracle Continues. The book was adapted into a televised docudrama film, called Son-Rise: A Miracle of Love and aired on NBC in 1979.",

A 1997 BBC documentary followed the family of a five-year-old autistic boy treated by the program. Effectiveness\nThere are no documented normalizations with older children, and it may be that success  depends on a certain level of intellectual potential . Some professionals have questioned the emphasis placed on eye contact and its potential problems for some children. The consensus within the medical community is that there is no cure for autism and only a very few treatments have empirical evidence for improvements in symptoms. A 2003 study found that involvement with The Son-Rise Program led to more drawbacks than benefits for the involved families over time, although family stress levels did not rise in all cases. A 2006 study found that The Son-Rise Program is not always implemented as it is typically described in the literature, which suggests it will be difficult to evaluate its efficacy. In 2009, United Kingdom s Advertising Standards Authority sanctioned The Option Institute for a misleading ad claiming Son-Rise as an autism cure.

    "text": "Imago (stylised as IMAGO) is an analog, walk-in, large format photo camera. It creates life-size self-portraits of people on 62   200 cm photographic paper via direct exposure. Since a negative is not created, every image is unique and cannot be reprinted. The images are colloquially referred to as  Imago-grams. The only existing camera was built in the 1970s by German physicist Werner Kraus and artist Erhard Hößle. It is based on an optical system invented by Kraus for scientific purposes. The camera was in museum storage from 1976 to 2006, when it was rediscovered and rebuilt by the inventor's daughter, artist Susanna Kraus. History\nIn 1970, physicist Werner Kraus was commissioned to photographically document the Daimler-Benz Wankel engine s combustion cycle. For this purpose, he invented a photo-optical system which captured images on a 1:1 scale. Later, based on the same system, Kraus, together with the artist and sculptor Erhard Hößle, built the Imago Camera. The camera and its photographs were exhibited in Munich during the Fluxus-movement. It operated for several years, but was archived in 1978 due to cessation of production of the photographic paper, which was essential for its operation. It was later stored in the archive of the Pinakothek der Moderne museum in Munich.",

Restoration\nIn 2005, photographs taken by the camera were rediscovered by Kraus' daughter, Susanna Kraus, which renewed her interest in Imago, and prompted her to restore it. During the following year, Susanna Kraus searched for a manufacturer who would produce the necessary photographic paper. When she convinced Ilford Switzerland in 2006 to develop and start the production of the direct positive paper, the curator of the New Collection of the Pinakothek der Moderne museum Florian Hufnagl agreed to release the camera from the archive and return it to the inventor's daughter. At the end of 2006, the first exhibition of the photos made with the restored Imago Camera was held in Vienna. After several years of travelling and exhibitions, in 2011, the camera inhabited a new photo studio started by Susanna Kraus in the Aufbau Haus on Moritzplatz, Berlin Kreuzberg.

The camera features a special internal setting of six strobe lights providing a high intensity light necessary for production of the large direct exposure images on paper, which is considerably less photosensitive than film. The Camera produces 62   200 cm sized black and white prints on Imago and Harman Direct Positive Paper.

Imago photographic paper\nImago Camera uses silver gelatin direct positive photographic paper developed in cooperation with Ilford Switzerland and HARMAN Technology specially for Imago. It is made for direct exposure and reacts as soon as an image is exposed onto it. The exposed paper is developed in a conventional black and white process taking ten minutes, after which the print is ready.

The by-election was caused by the death of the sitting Liberal National Member of Parliament, Joseph Leckie. The election was won by George Schuster, a fellow Liberal National. Candidates\nLiberal National\nThe Liberal Nationals selected Sir George Schuster. Schuster was something of a renaissance man. He had qualified as a barrister and had already had successful careers in business, colonial government, and economics. He came from a wealthy family with banking and cotton interests. As a representative of the National Government Schuster was not opposed by the Conservatives, although they were apparently disappointed the Liberal Nationals exercised their right to find their own successor to Leckie and did not cede the National nomination to the local Conservatives. Schuster later went on to spend 22 years on Oxfordshire County Council and achieve success in the field of further education as Chairman of the Board of Governors of Atlantic College from 1963-1973. He died in 1982 aged 101 years. Labour\nSchuster was therefore opposed only by the Labour Party candidate, George Jeger, a journalist from London and a local councillor in Shoreditch, of which he was mayor in 1938. Jeger had been Labour candidate in Bethnal Green South West at the 1935 general election.",

Issues\nAs the National candidate, Schuster sought to defend the record of the National Government and in particular the foreign policy associated with Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. The great issue of the day was the worsening of international relations with the rise of Adolf Hitler in Germany, Benito Mussolini in Italy and Japanese expansionism in the Far East. Chamberlain s policy of appeasing these dissatisfied powers, in the immediate glow of what was thought to be Chamberlain s success in getting the Munich Agreement signed at the end of September, was the one that Schuster, and those in the government supporting him, chose to emphasise. He also attacked the Labour Party for its support of economic planning and state regulation at the expense of small business and local enterprise and for its allegation that the government planned further cuts in social welfare provision. However, the main issue was for the electors of Walsall to show their approval or rejection of the Munich Agreement.

The novel is probably set between 1792 and 1797 and follows the three Dashwood sisters and their widowed mother as they are forced to leave the family estate in Sussex and move to a modest cottage on the property of a distant relative in Devon. There the two eldest girls experience love and heartbreak that tries the contrasting characters of both. Plot summary\nOn his deathbed, Henry Dashwood makes his son, John, promise to provide for his stepmother and half-sisters, Elinor, Marianne and Margaret, from his inheritance. John's wife Fanny instead persuades him not to support them financially, leaving them a greatly reduced income. Fanny's brother Edward Ferrars arrives for a visit. When he and Elinor seem to be growing close, Fanny warns Mrs Dashwood that their mother has higher goals for Edward. Affronted, Mrs Dashwood moves her family to Barton Cottage in Devonshire, which her second cousin, Sir John Middleton, offered for a low rent. Later, while dining with the Middletons at Barton Park, family friend Colonel Brandon is attracted to Marianne.",

However, he is aged thirty-five, which seems too old to sixteen-year-old Marianne's romantic sensibilities. While out walking, Marianne sprains her ankle. John Willoughby happens upon her and carries Marianne home. During subsequent visits, their similar artistic taste causes Marianne to fall in love with him, abandoning caution and propriety. Just as an engagement seems imminent, Willoughby informs the Dashwoods that his elderly cousin Mrs Smith, whom he is financially dependent upon due to his debts, is sending him to London indefinitely on business. Marianne is left distraught. When Edward Ferrars visits Barton Cottage, he seems subdued. Shortly afterwards, sisters Anne and Lucy Steele, vulgar cousins of Sir John's mother-in-law, Mrs Jennings, stay at Barton Park. While there, Lucy confides to Elinor that she and Edward are secretly engaged, giving Elinor an insight into Lucy's jealous and calculating nature. Mrs Jennings invites the elder Dashwood sisters to visit her in London. After Marianne's letters to Willoughby go unanswered, they unexpectedly meet at a ball. Willoughby, there with another woman, greets Marianne coldly, later informing her he is betrothed to the rich Miss Grey. Marianne is heartbroken but tells Elinor that she and Willoughby never were engaged.",

Colonel Brandon reveals to Elinor that Willoughby had earlier seduced and abandoned Brandon's teenaged ward, Eliza Williams. Willoughby's cousin has consequently disinherited him, which explains his need to marry an heiress. Meanwhile, the Steele sisters come to London and are invited to stay at John and Fanny Dashwood's London house in preference to Elinor and Marianne. Based on their cordiality, Anne mistakenly believes that the Ferrars have become fond enough of Lucy to welcome her into the family and reveals Lucy's engagement to Edward. As a result, the sisters are dismissed from the house, and Edward's wealthy mother orders him to break off the engagement. When Edward refuses, he is disinherited in favour of his younger brother. On learning this, Colonel Brandon shows his admiration for Edward's honourable conduct by offering him the nearby parsonage, allowing him and Lucy to marry after he is ordained. Mrs Jennings takes the Dashwood sisters to visit her second daughter as they journey back to Devonshire. Marianne goes walking in the rain and contracts putrid fever. When Marianne's condition worsens, Elinor writes home. Colonel Brandon, who lives nearby, volunteers to bring Marianne's mother. That night, Willoughby arrives.

He tells Elinor that he genuinely loved Marianne. However, the callous way he talks about Eliza and his wife lessens Elinor's pity for him. Marianne recovers, and learning of Elinor's own silent heartache, is ashamed of her ostentatious grief, and vows to be guided by her sister's good sense and amend her future behaviour. After their return home, a family servant happens to encounter Lucy at a nearby market town and brings back news that she is now Mrs Ferrars. This final act of spite becomes obvious when Edward arrives to reveal that Lucy had jilted him and married his now wealthy younger brother. After being ordained, Edward marries Elinor, while Marianne later marries Colonel Brandon. The two sisters can now harmoniously live as neighbours. Composition\nJane Austen wrote the first draft of the novel in epistolary form, possibly as early as 1795, when she was around 19 years old, or in 1797 at the age of 21. She reportedly gave it the working title Elinor and Marianne, reflecting the focus on the contrasting personalities of the two eldest Dashwood sisters.",

This early version of the story was written in letters, a common narrative style of the period, which allowed for intimate insight into the characters' thoughts and feelings. Austen later revised the novel, changing it from an epistolary format to a continuous narrative and retitling it Sense and Sensibility, thereby enabling a more flexible and expansive exploration of the story s themes and social commentary. Austen drew inspiration from contemporary novels of the late 18th century that explored similar themes of romance, morality, and social conduct. Adam Stevenson's Life and Love (1785), which recounts personal romantic experiences and societal expectations, is thought to have influenced Austen's depiction of complex emotional relationships and the challenges of constrained social circumstances. Jane West's A Gossip's Story (1796) is also considered a significant influence, as it features one sister characterized by rational sense and another by passionate, emotive sensibility. Notably, West's romantic sister shares the name Marianne with Austen's character, and modern editions of West's novel highlight textual and thematic similarities, suggesting that Austen may have consciously or unconsciously drawn on these elements in shaping her own characters and plot. Austen may also have drawn on historical figures in developing certain characters.",

    "text": "Austen may also have drawn on historical figures in developing certain characters. In particular, Warren Hastings, the first Governor-General of India, is often cited as a potential inspiration for Colonel Brandon. Parallels include rumored illegitimate daughters Hastings with his possible daughter Eliza de Feuillide, and Brandon with Eliza Brandon in the novel as well as early departures to India at age seventeen. Both figures are also associated with dueling and matters of honor, characteristics echoed in Colonel Brandon s backstory. Literary scholar Linda Robinson Walker has argued that Hastings  haunts Sense and Sensibility in the character of Colonel Brandon,  noting that Austen may have drawn on her knowledge of contemporary political figures and family connections to lend historical depth and realism to her fictional characters. Critical views\n19th-century responses\nEarly reviews of Sense and Sensibility focused on the novel as providing lessons in conduct (which would be debated by later critics), as well as reviewing the characters. The Norton Critical Edition of Sense and Sensibility contains a number of such responses in its supplementary material. An  Unsigned Review  in the February 1812 Critical Review praises the novel as well-written and realistic, with well-drawn characters and a  highly pleasing  plot in which  the whole is just long enough to interest the reader without fatiguing . Elinor and her mother are praised, while Marianne's extreme sensibility is seen as bringing unhappiness on herself.",

Another  Unsigned Review  from the May 1812 British Critic further emphasises the novel's function as a type of conduct book. In this author's opinion, Austen's favouring of Elinor's temperament over Marianne's provides the lesson. The reviewer claims that  the object of the work is to represent the effects on the conduct of life, of discreet quiet good sense on the one hand, and an overrefined and excessive susceptibility on the other. He goes on to state that the book contains  many sober and salutary maxims for the conduct of life  within a  very pleasing and entertaining narrative. W. F. Pollock's 1861 article for Frasier's Magazine, on  British Novelists  is described as an  early example of what would become the customary view of Sense and Sensibility. In addition to emphasising the novel's morality, Pollock reviews the characters in catalogue-like fashion, allotting praise and criticism on the assumption that Austen favours Elinor's point of view and temperament and extending it to the minor characters. Mrs Palmer is silly, Sir John Dashwood is selfish, the behaviour of the Steele sisters is vulgar.",

However, an anonymous piece titled  Miss Austen  published in 1866 in The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine departs from other early criticism in sympathising with Marianne over Elinor, claiming that Elinor is  too good  a character. The article also differs from other reviews in its claim that the  prevailing merit  of the book is not in its sketch of the two sisters; rather, the book is effective because of its  excellent treatment of the subordinate characters. Alice Meynell's 1894 article  The Classic Novelist  in the Pall Mall Gazette also concurs with Austen's attention to small things and minor characters and small matters since  that which makes life, art, and work trivial is a triviality of relations. Also discussed is the children's function in highlighting  the folly of their mothers , especially in Lady Middleton's case. Characterisation\nAs used by Austen, the word  sense  signifies good judgment, wisdom, or prudence, and  sensibility  signifies sensitivity, sympathy, or emotionality. By changing the title from the names of the sisters Elinor and Marianne in her first choice of title to that of their qualities, Austen adds  philosophical depth  to what began as a sketch of two characters.",

However, these characteristics, as demonstrated through the dominant behaviour of the sisters, are not mutually exclusive. Although their qualities are compared and contrasted through means of the plot, neither sister is a one-sided caricature. Humanised through emotional suffering, Marianne's sympathy for her sister teaches her self-control and prudence, while Elinor learns to express her emotions more overtly. Nevertheless, the changes to the original novel's structure are never resolved in the eyes of some critics. A. Walton Litz judged that Sense and Sensibility is  caught uneasily between burlesque and the serious novel...in which the crude antitheses of the original structure were never successfully overcome . Tony Tanner sees a shift of view instead to  the tensions between the potential instability of the individual and the required stabilities of society , as demonstrated by the influence of the governing qualities on the younger and the older sister. While sensibility has its positive aspects, its over-cultivation leads in the novel to the psychosomatic disorders to which Marianne nearly succumbs.",

Claire Tomalin too argues that Sense and Sensibility has a  wobble in its approach , which developed because Austen, in the course of writing the novel, gradually became less certain about whether sense or sensibility should triumph. Austen characterises Marianne as a sweet person with attractive qualities: intelligence, musical talent, frankness, and the capacity to love deeply. She also acknowledges that Willoughby, with all his faults, continues to love and, in some measure, appreciate Marianne. For these reasons, some readers find Marianne's ultimate marriage to Colonel Brandon an unsatisfactory ending. In Rachel Brownstein's opinion, the differences between the Dashwood sisters have been exaggerated, and in fact the sisters are more alike than they are different, with Elinor having an  excellent heart  and being capable of the same romantic passions as Marianne feels, while Marianne has much sense as well. Elinor is more reserved, more polite, and less impulsive than Marianne, who loves poetry, taking walks across picturesque landscapes and believes in intense romantic relationships, but it is this very closeness between the sisters that allows these differences to emerge during their exchanges.

In epistolary fiction, action, dialogue, and character interactions are all reflected through letters sent from one or more of the characters. In exploring Austen's fraught relationship with such fiction, Favret surveys how Austen  wrestled with epistolary form  in previous writings and, with the publication of Sense and Sensibility,  announced her victory over the constraints of the letter . Favret contends that Austen's version of the letter separates her from her  admired predecessor, Samuel Richardson  in that Austen's letters are  a misleading guide to the human heart which, in the best instances, is always changing and adapting. According to Favret, the character of Elinor Dashwood is an  anti-epistolary heroine  whose  inner world  of thoughts and feelings does not find  direct expression in the novel, although her point of view controls the story. Sense and Sensibility establishes what Favret calls a  new privacy  in the novel, which was constrained by previous notions of the romance of letters. This new privacy is a  less constraining mode of narration  in which Austen's narrator provides commentary on the action, rather than the characters themselves through the letters. Favret claims that in Sense and Sensibility, Austen wants to  recontextualize  the letter and bring it into a  new realism.",

Austen does so by imbuing the letter with dangerous power when Marianne writes to Willoughby; both their love and the letter  prove false . Additionally, Favret claims that Austen uses the correspondence of both of the sisters to emphasise the contrasts in their personalities. When both write letters upon arriving in London, Elinor's letter is the  dutiful letter of the 'sensible sister'  and Marianne writes a  vaguely illicit letter  reflecting her characterisation as the  sensitive  sister . What is perhaps most striking about Favret's analysis is that she notes that the lovers who write to one another never unite with each other. Societal themes\nA common theme of Austen criticism has been on the legal aspects of society and the family, particularly wills, the rights of first and second sons, and lines of inheritance. Gene Ruoff's book Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility explores these issues in an extended discussion of the novel. The first two chapters deal extensively with the subject of wills and the discourse of inheritance. These topics reveal what Ruoff calls  the cultural fixation on priority of male birth . According to Ruoff, male birth is by far the dominant issue in these legal conversations.",

Ruoff observes that, within the linear family, the order of male birth decides issues of eligibility and merit. When Robert Ferrars becomes his mother's heir, Edward is no longer appealing to his  opportunistic  fiancée Lucy, who quickly turns her attention to the foppish Robert and  entraps him  in order to secure the inheritance for herself. Ruoff comments that Lucy is specifically aiming for the heir because of the monetary advantage. William Galperin, in his book The History Austen, comments on the tendency of this system of patriarchal inheritance and earning as working to ensure the vulnerability of women. Because of this vulnerability, Galperin contends that Sense and Sensibility shows marriage as the only practical solution  against the insecurity of remaining an unmarried woman. Feminist critics have long been engaged in conversations about Jane Austen, and Sense and Sensibility has figured in these discussions, especially in the context of the patriarchal system of inheritance and earning.

Gilbert and Gubar argue that Austen explores the effects of patriarchal control on women, particularly in the spheres of employment and inheritance. In Sense and Sensibility they educe the fact that Mr. John Dashwood cuts off his stepmother and half sisters from their home as well as promised income, as an instance of these effects. They also point to the  despised  Mrs. Ferrars's tampering with the patriarchal line of inheritance in her disowning of her elder son, Edward Ferrars, as proof that this construction is ultimately arbitrary. Gilbert and Gubar contend that while Sense and Sensibility's ultimate message is that  young women like Marianne and Elinor must submit to powerful conventions of society by finding a male protector , women such as Mrs. Ferrars and Lucy Steele demonstrate how women can  themselves become agents of repression, manipulators of conventions, and survivors.

In the chapter  Sense and Sensibility: Opinions Too Common and Too Dangerous , from her book Jane Austen: Women, Politics, and the Novel, Claudia Johnson also gives a feminist reading of Sense and Sensibility. She differs from previous critics, especially the earliest ones, in her contention that Sense and Sensibility is not, as it is often assumed to be, a  dramatized conduct book  that values  female prudence  (associated with Elinor's sense) over  female impetuosity  (associated with Marianne's sensibility). Rather, Johnson sees Sense and Sensibility as a  dark and disenchanted novel  that views  institutions of order  such as property, marriage, and family in a negative light, an attitude that makes the novel the  most attuned to social criticism  of Austen's works. According to Johnson, Sense and Sensibility critically examines the codes of propriety as well as their enforcement by the community.

Johnson compares Edward to Willoughby in this regard, claiming that all of the differences between them as individuals do not hide the fact that their failures are actually identical; Johnson calls them both  weak, duplicitous, and selfish,  lacking the honesty and forthrightness with which Austen endows other  exemplary gentlemen  in her work. Mary Poovey's analysis in The Proper Lady and the Woman Writer: Ideology as Style in the Works of Mary Wollstonecraft, Mary Shelley and Jane Austen concurs with Johnson's on the dark tone of Sense and Sensibility. Poovey contends that Sense and Sensibility has a  somber tone  in which conflict breaks out between Austen's engagement with her  self-assertive characters  and the moral codes necessary to control their potentially  anarchic  desires.

She does so by demonstrating that Elinor's self-denial, especially in her keeping of Lucy Steele's secret and willingness to help Edward, even though both of these actions were hurtful to her, ultimately contribute to her own contentment and that of others. In this way, Poovey contends that Austen suggests that the submission to society that Elinor demonstrates is the proper way to achieve happiness in life. Harmony with the environment\nThe new discipline of Ecocriticism extends the examination of imbalance in Austen's novels and finds that she  antedated Victorian novelists in predicting early signs of environmental manipulation and identifying the attitudes and practices that led to the ecological collapse of early nineteenth century England .

Rowland argues that human culture estranges people from nature rather than returning them to it, serving merely through the fact of ownership to bolster their place in the social order. Marianne's emotional estrangement begins as she is ripped from the aesthetic enjoyment of her home environment, although ultimately she finds a new identity by uniting with Colonel Brandon on his estate at Delaford. Publication history\nIn 1811, Thomas Egerton of the Military Library publishing house in London accepted the manuscript for publication in three volumes. Austen paid to have the book published and paid the publisher a commission on sales.

The novel has been in continuous publication since 1811, and has many times been illustrated, excerpted, abridged, and adapted for stage, film, and television. The novel was soon translated into French by Madame Isabelle de Montolieu as Raison et Sensibilité, ou les deux manières d'aimer (1815). Montolieu had only the most basic knowledge of English, and her translations were more  imitations  of Austen's novels as Montolieu had her assistants provide a summary of Austen's novels, which she then translated into an embellished French that often radically altered Austen's plots and characters. The  translation  of Sense and Sensibility by Montolieu changes entire scenes and characters, for example having Marianne call Willoughby an  angel  and an  Adonis  upon first meeting him, lines that are not in the English original.",

    "text": "Likewise, the scene where Mrs Dashwood criticises her husband for planning to subsidise his widowed stepmother because it might be disadvantageous to  our little Harry , Mrs Dashwood soon forgets about Harry and it is made apparent her objections are founded in greed; Montolieu altered the scene by having Mrs Dashwood continuing to speak of  our little Harry  as the basis of her objections, completely changing her motives. When Elinor learns the Ferrars who married Lucy Steele is Robert, not Edward, Montolieu adds a scene, in which Edward, the Dashwood sisters and their mother all break down in tears while clasping hands, that was not in the original. Austen has the marriage of Robert Ferrars and Lucy Steele end well while Montolieu changes the marriage into a failure.

During the Eritrean War of Independence, Denmark sent humanitarian assistance to the Eritrean People's Liberation Front. In the 1980s, the parliament of Denmark passed a resolution supporting the independence in Eritrea. Denmark opened an embassy in Asmara in July 1997, but closed it in June 2002, because of the lack of democracy in the country.

A former standalone blog site, it is currently a Facebook page, after www.mocha.com.ph went defunct in February 2017. History\nThe Mocha Uson Blog previously concentrated on giving sex-related tips or advice. It also featured 'sessions in the bedroom' with her all-female group, the Mocha Girls. According to her, it later became a platform for Filipinos to express their concerns which are relayed by Mocha to the national government. The page became an online political advocacy tool by Uson to promote the 2016 presidential campaign of Rodrigo Duterte and by October 2016 most of the sex-themed videos hosted by the page were already deleted but copies remain accessible through other non-related YouTube accounts. The Facebook page's followers increased to 4 million after Uson became a vocal supporter of President Rodrigo Duterte. According to Uson, the Facebook page had  quite a number of followers  before she became a public supporter of Duterte. When then-President-elect Duterte decided to boycott mainstream media organizations, Uson declared support for Duterte and managed to secure an exclusive interview with Duterte in June 2016. Videos of the interview were posted on the Mocha Uson Blog page. Mocha Uson Blog, aside from being hosted in a Facebook page, had a separate blog site which was hosted at https:  mocha.com.ph .",

The live video, dubbed as  Pepedederalismo  by the media, was criticized for being lewd and obscene. The video showed Olivar dancing in a sexually suggestive manner by repeatedly touching his crotch and chest while singing lyrics about  pepederalismo , a portmanteau of federalism and the colloquial terms for vagina (pekpek) and breasts (dede). Uson said there was  nothing wrong with the video , which she said was meant to generate conversation among Filipinos about the concept of federalism. She said the jingle was not part of the government's official information campaign on the topic. She also said that she did not receive any government funding to produce the controversial video, albeit it wasn't immediately clear if she recorded the video during her working hours as a government employee.

Her letters depict not only the racism and sexism faced by Northern Black women, but also her struggles with education, her awareness of politics, and her romantic friendship with Rebecca Primus. An acute observer, she provided through her letters perspective on the lives of working-class people in the nineteenth century, as well as on women's intimate relationships. Brown was raised in Philadelphia and had no formal education. She learned to read and write and, in order to improve her ability to earn a living, to sew and cook. Having few ties with her own family, she became an intimate member of the prominent Primus family of Hartford, Connecticut. For a decade between 1859 and 1868, she had a romantic friendship with the oldest daughter of the family and exchanged letters with her. The letters tell of Brown's fourteen different employers and eight addresses during the period, in addition to giving information about her chronic illnesses and fatigue. She wrote vivid descriptions of events in the Black communities in which she lived. Housed in the Primus collection of the Connecticut Museum of Culture and History, her letters give rare insight into the lives of working-class Black women in the period immediately preceding and following the American Civil War.",

Early life and education\nAdeline Brown was born on December 21, 1841, and was raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as a free Black person. Her father died during her childhood and her mother remarried, despite Addie's objections. She lived briefly with an aunt in Philadelphia, and then cut off ties with her family, except for a brother, Ally Brown, who served in the Civil War. Brown did not have a formal education, and although she had learned to read and write, her handwriting was difficult to read and peppered with poor grammar and colloquial speech. It is unknown how she came to know the Primus family of Hartford, Connecticut. She may have attended the Shiloh Baptist Church in Philadelphia, which was pastored by Jeremiah Asher, a first cousin to Holdridge Primus, or have been a boarder in the Primus's home. She might also have worked at a restaurant in Hartford owned by Jeremiah Jacobs and Raphael Sands. Jacobs was the brother of Mehitable Primus and Sands was their brother-in-law.",

Although it is unknown how she met the family, by 1859, Brown was part of the inner circle of the Primus family and had begun an intense friendship with Holdridge and Mehitable's oldest daughter, Rebecca. Brown was described as tall, and although she exchanged photographs with Primus, none have been found. Her letters reveal her to be friendly, congenial, and spirited, but cautious in showing affection. Independent and confident, she made pragmatic choices to survive and had little patience with irritable people. She was at times a mischief-maker, but she was open and honest about her feelings and poured out her emotions in her letters. Lacking close family ties, Brown created fictitious family connections with friends. Ally, the one brother with whom she kept in touch, broke off contact with her after she was unable to visit him for Thanksgiving because she needed to work. She was bright, intelligent, keenly observant, and a good story-teller, bringing life and detail to the events she described in her letters.

Although Mrs. Games offered to continue the position, Brown did not accept, longing to return to Hartford and Rebecca Primus. In a February 1860 letter, she asked Primus to intercede with her mother so that she could learn how to sew, realizing that sewing would allow her to work even if she did not have the physical stamina to do domestic work. Returning to Hartford, she worked for a few months for a Mrs. Kellogg, but left in August, after experiencing a severe sunburn. By early 1861, Brown was living in the household of John H. Jackson, proprietor of an eating house and saloon in New York City. Her brother Ally also resided in this family's home, which was also a boardinghouse, in Greenwich Village. Brown cared for the couple's nine children and kept their house, but was rarely paid. Instead, Mrs. Jackson at times treated Brown as if she was family and at other times as if she was an apprentice learning the trade to be a milliner and seamstress. Struggling with overwork and irregular pay, Brown left the Jacksons in September 1862, and returned to Hartford. In 1862, she worked for Primus's family friends Henry and Elizabeth Nott.",

Elizabeth allowed Primus to spend the night with Brown at her home, but these visits stopped when Rebecca's father, Holdridge, objected. For the rest of her first three years in Hartford, little is known of Brown's employment. Few letters were written by Brown, since she and Primus were living in the same town. The letters that exist in the period show that at this time their physical relationship became more intense. In 1865, Brown worked at Smith's Dye House, an establishment resembling a modern laundry or dry cleaner. She made good money,  19 per month at a time when female domestic workers earned about  2.65 per month including their board. From her salary, she paid Primus's aunt, Emily Sands, about  8.50 per month for room and board. Brown also worked regular hours, instead of being on call at all hours of the day and night when working in a household. She lost the job because of a lack of customers in December 1865. The previous month, Primus had gone to Maryland to establish a school for the Freedmen's Bureau. Brown recognized at that time that although her feelings for Primus had not lessened, it was likely that their lives would be lived separately.",

Brown recognized at that time that although her feelings for Primus had not lessened, it was likely that their lives would be lived separately. One of her suitors for several years had been Joseph Tines. He was a waiter on the Granite State steamship, which regularly ran between Hartford and New York City. He was originally from Philadelphia, so she may have known him from childhood there, or met him when she was working in New York. She announced her engagement to Tines in a letter to Primus in December 1865. At that time, Brown was working for various Hartford ladies   Mrs. Couch, Mrs. Doughlass, and Mrs. Swans   sewing garments and hoping to make enough money to get through the winter of 1866. She often secured clients through Mehitable. By February, she was working for professor John T. Huntington, who taught at Trinity College. From the beginning the job did not go well as Huntington had agreed to pay her  2.50 per week and then tried to pay her only  2.00. Brown objected and was successful in the dispute, but did not like the work and left in April, taking in sewing until she secured a position with the Crowell family in May.",

Brown remained at the Crowells for a year, but in May 1867 moved to Farmington to work at Miss Porter's School, as an assistant to Raphael Sands. She initially enjoyed working at the school, the comradery of other workers, and the ability to use the library. She earned  12 per month and did not have to pay for room and board, but the work was exhausting and she reported that she often had headaches, backaches, and poor health. She also experienced racist attitudes while working at the school. Her political conscience was growing at the time and she reported in letters to Primus that she refused to attend a minstrel show and protested against the local church's segregated seating. She took over Raphael's position as head cook in the summer, but decided in January 1868 that she was definitely going to marry. Even though Miss Porter offered to hire both Brown and Tines, Brown turned down the job because it was so strenuous. In April, Brown married Tines and moved back to Philadelphia. An anonymous letter, possibly from Tines, indicates that they had a happy life and children. Correspondence\nBrown wrote more than a hundred letters to Primus between 1859 and 1869.",

They contain critical observations about the details of her life and work, society and politics, gossip about their community, her search for affection, and her expression of deep feeling for Primus. In some letters, she signed as Aerthena and addressed Primus as Stella. She often wrote of flirtations with suitors and the possibility of marriage, which were openly discussed without fear of threat to their own relationship. Her principle emotional attachment was to Primus, but she recognized the importance of marriage for her economic security and social stability. From 1862, the nature of the letters changed, with Brown focusing on what she was reading and her involvement in community events. She became more confident and wrote more of her efforts at self-improvement and the ways she tried to better her opportunities. She wrote of attending balls, fairs, and debates, giving perspective on the events which were important to the black community and weighing in on issues like emancipation, civil rights, and political events. Although the letters contain Brown's private thoughts and expressions of eroticism, the relationship between the two women was not a secret to their family and friends. Some of them felt the relationship was an infatuation that would dissolve after marriage.",

Some of them felt the relationship was an infatuation that would dissolve after marriage. Mehitable accepted the relationship and acknowledged that if one of them had been a man, they might have married. Their community supported their friendship, as long as it would not interfere with a courtship with an eventual marriage to a man. Writing about a novel, Women Friendships by Grace Aguilar, that she had read, Brown analyzed whether the characters' differing social status, age, and education mirrored her own relationship with Primus. As the book was a cautionary tale against mixed-class friendships, Brown wondered if it meant that their relationship was doomed. According to sociologist Farah Griffin, Primus thought that class was less important than one's moral reputation. Besides Brown's own declarations of love for Primus, the letters also gossiped openly about topics like incest and sex outside of marriage, as well as of encounters with other women with whom she had shared a bed. Death and legacy\nBrown died from tuberculosis on January 11, 1870, at her home. Primus had saved the correspondence Brown wrote to her, indicating the importance of their relationship.

After Primus's death, the letters were acquired in 1934 by the Connecticut Museum of Culture and History. Women's historian Eloise E. Scroggins noted that Brown's letters  provide insight into Black female relationships and the difficulties of life for Northern Blacks during the Civil War  period. They reveal the precarious economic and political circumstances of African Americans living in New England both before and after the war; Brown had at least fourteen employers and eight addresses between 1859 and 1867. They also fill a void in the historical documentation about Black women's private lives. History has often focused on records left by organizations and leaders, paying scarce attention to the lives and interactions of ordinary people and particularly women's lives have remained unexplored. Research on romantic friendships has also focused on White women's relationships, which do not typically depict an erotic nature to their passionate attachments. Some scholars, such as Carroll Smith-Rosenberg and Lillian Faderman, have argued that liaisons between White women at the time describe kissing, hugging, and sharing a bed, but not sexual contact. Other scholars, according to Sue Morgan, Judith M. Bennett and Leila J. Rupp, have disagreed, noting that the depiction of romantic friendship as devoid of lesbian behavior was premature as while few documents have surfaced, some have, and such a conclusion might erase lesbian identity.",

Nevertheless, Brown's letters add dimension to the analysis of nineteenth-century same-sex relationships, as she openly wrote of their passion, kisses, and touching of the breasts. The relationship between Brown and Primus defies modern definitions of heterosexual and homosexual relationships, because of the separate spheres in which men and women lived their lives in the nineteenth century. What the letters show, according to sociologist Karen Hansen, is that sexuality was more fluid in the Victorian era than had been previously acknowledged by scholars. Their relationship also gives insight into the attitudes among members of the Black community in the years after slavery ended. Notes\nReferences\nCitations\n    Bibliography",

    "text": "Billy Corkhill is a fictional character from the British Channel 4 soap opera Brookside and Hollyoaks, played by John McArdle. The character debuted on-screen during the episode broadcast on 27 August 1985. Billy was introduced as part of the show's new family, the Corkhills, consisting of Billy, his wife Doreen Corkhill (Kate Fitzgerald), and their teenage children, Rod (Jason Hope) and Tracy Corkhill (Justine Kerrigan). Billy is characterised as the reluctant husband of Doreen, an aspiring woman who wants the Corkhills to own their own home. Her mission to present a good image for the family is marred by her secret spending which gets the family into debt. Writers explored their debt issues throughout Billy's early tenure. They portrayed him as desperate to provide, tampering with the electricity and committing fraud with the help of his brother Jimmy Corkhill (Dean Sullivan). Writers portrayed Billy having a mental breakdown in which he drives his car over his neighbours' front gardens. McArdle has said it was his favourite storyline as Billy. Doreen's over spending and Billy's crime of armed robbery eventually end their marriage. Producers then paired the character with Sheila Grant (Sue Johnston) and they later marry. Doreen returned to the series but Billy decides to remain loyal to Sheila.",

Billy was well received by viewers, especially for his representation of unemployed men in British society during the 1980s. Television critics have praised on McArdle's portrayal of Billy. Allan Crow from Fife Today branded Billy a  legendary soap character  and Andrew Bullock from the Daily Express opined that McArdle was an  integral  cast member  in Brookside's heyday . The character also became subjected to controversy when the Independent Broadcasting Authority investigated Brookside after an episode depicted Billy holding durex condoms. The regulator later retracted their complaint and praised the show. McArdle reprised the role of Billy in 2025 in several special Brookside and Hollyoaks crossover episodes as part of latter's 30th Anniversary. Casting\nMcArdle was performing in a play which he thought was so awful he wanted to quit. The director convinced him to stay with the promise of helping secure further work. In the play, McArdle put on a Scouse accent and a Brookside producer witnessed his performance which resulted in an audition. The director was then hired by Brookside and they helped McArdle secure the role of Billy. Kate Fitzgerald was hired to play Billy's wife Doreen.",

He is portrayed as the reluctant husband to  aspiring  wife Doreen. Writers pitted the Corkhills against their more socialist neighbours, the Grant family. Billy has to contend with Doreen's  shopaholic  tendencies, as she competes with the Collins family and presents a  good image  of the Corkhills, an image she portrays despite knowing Billy's family have a  shady  side. Billy's plight resonated well with viewers, especially those facing hardship in 1980s Britain. McArdle started to receive letters from male viewers who believed that Billy's story was identical to their own experiences. McArdle's performance also blurred fiction and reality with some viewers. The actor received job offers from businessmen and a young viewer sent their  2 pocket money to the Brookside set to help Billy.

A controversial story for the Corkhills was created when Tracy begins a romance with her geography teacher Peter Montague (Mark Draper). After the pair return from a skiing trip, Billy goes to the school and punches Peter. Billy is arrested for assault and later given a three month prison sentence, suspended for a year. At the time, Lucy O'Brien from The Guardian described it as the  most dramatic analysis  of child abuse on television. She added that  pugnacious Billy  had to face the fact his  wayward daughter  was in love with her teacher; the story subsequently played out over a  tense month . From this producers developed an issue lead story for the Corkhills, as they deal with the problems that arise from debts.

Billy retaliates by going on a rampage in his car, driving all over the other front gardens on Brookside Close. McArdle told Graham Kibble-White, the author of 20 Years of Brookside, that his character reacted badly because he suspected Doreen of having an affair with her work boss at the dentists. Doreen had not had an affair with her boss but he could not believe she was willing to have sex with him in exchange for money. McArdle told Johnson that  Billy just felt like a total failure - that his wife had nearly turned to prostitution because of him being unemployed. He smacked her. She threw the key in the mud. Billy subsequently felt like his  whole word  and  his whole family were falling down. Kibble-White believed that the car scene perfectly demonstrated the desperation that Billy.

After the scenes were broadcast, viewers sympathised with Billy's plight and told him that he had  exorcised  all of their feelings on-screen.

Billy and Jimmy's older brother Frankie Corkhill had been murdered by Joey Godden (Carl Chase) some years earlier. Jimmy attacks Joey inside The Swan pub, but Jimmy is later beaten and hospitalised. Godden begins to threaten the Corkhills and sends a wreath to their home reading  Billy and Sheila - R.I.P . Billy tries to reason with Godden but he vows to carry on.

Reception\nAs the men of Brookside Close go, Billy Corkhill ranks up there with the very best of them. He was a solid working-class local lad, whose battles with bouts of unemployment, troublesome children and errant wives, made him a hero to those who fought to keep their heads above water in the 80s. He remains one of Brookside's best-loved and most memorable characters.A writer from the official Brookside website stated  a dominating presence on the Close for the second half of the  80s, Billy Corkhill ensured his legacy would last for at least another decade. Allan Crow from Fife Today branded Billy a  legendary soap character . Tim Hughes from the Oxford Mail said that McArdle is  best known  as the  long-suffering  Billy. Patrick McLennan from What's on TV opined that Billy is a  troubled  character.

Overview\nComposition\nIn 1995 Penderecki was commissioned to write a work to commemorate the third millennium of Jerusalem, a city the composer had first visited in 1974 in the aftermath of the Yom Kippur War. Penderecki decided to write an oratorio titled Seven Gates of Jerusalem (there is an eighth  golden  gate but, according to Jewish tradition, this is reserved for the arrival of the Messiah). Penderecki composed the work between April and December 1996. The work was premiered in Jerusalem on 9 January 1997; the orchestra included members of the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra and Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Lorin Maazel. The Polish premiere followed on 14 March 1997, under the direction of Kazimierz Kord. It was only after the Polish performance that the composer decided to call the work his Seventh Symphony, though he had not yet completed his Sixth Symphony (which would eventually be published and premiered in 2017). The composer has since also written an Eighth Symphony, which like the Seventh is a choral symphony.",

    "text": "The composer has since also written an Eighth Symphony, which like the Seventh is a choral symphony. In categorizing the work, James L. Zychowicz writes in his review:\nThis work also belongs to the choral symphony of the nineteenth century, reminiscent in a sense of Mahler s Eighth Symphony for its use of voices throughout the work. Similarly, Mahler s efforts to bring together different texts in the case of the Eighth Symphony, the Latin hymn  Veni creator spiritus  and the final scene from the second part of Goethe s Faust, Penderecki combined verses from various psalms, as well as different parts of the Old Testament. Psalms and prophetic texts are brought together in this Jerusalem inspired work which, in this sense, reflects those aspects of the old city as a place of worship and a locus of prophetic vision. In this sense, it is a return to those seventeenth-century composers, whose works use large forces along with concertato sonorities to present biblical texts, but conceived along much larger lines. Zychowicz adds that while  each of the movements is distinct enough to stand on its own merits, ... when conceived together,  they  form a cohesive symphonic structure.",

The text of the symphony is written primarily in Latin, while the sixth movement,  the most dramatic of the entire work,  is written in Hebrew; the text in this penultimate movement, taken from the book of Ezekiel, is presented by a speaker. Significance of the number seven\nWhile the symphony is not a pictorial or descriptive work, the number seven plays a significant part in it. The work is not only written in seven movements but is  pervaded by the number 'seven' at various levels,  with an extensive system of seven-note phrases binding the work together,  while the frequent presence of seven notes repeated at a single pitch will be evident even on a first hearing, as also the seven fortissimo chords bringing the seventh and final movement to an end. Musical manipulation of text\nZychowicz states that the composer's manipulation of text may have been an important factor in shaping the musical structure of the work, as well. By setting selected verses instead of complete psalms,  he gave the text focus and clarity.... Taken together, the verses for the first movement are ... essentially a new text, albeit one redolent of the psalter.",

Route description\nMS 590's western terminus is located just west of the town of Seminary along US 49, just north of its intersection with MS 589. Heading east along Main Street into town (just past its crossing of the Okatoma Creek, the road passes some stores, homes, and churches.

The highway crosses US 11, a railroad, and Rocky Creek on a 2,000-foot-long (610 m) bridge and then heads around the south side of Jones County Junior College with a driveway providing access to the college. Now curving slightly to the northeast, MS 590 ends southeast of downtown Ellisville at an intersection with MS 29. History\nThe general routing of MS 590 had existed in the state highway system since at least 1928. By 1950, the MS 590 designation was applied to this road with a small portion of the road around Seminary being paved. The road was slowly improved over the next few years until it had been fully improved by 1964. Beginning in 2011, the Mississippi Department of Transportation constructed a 2.3-mile-long (3.7 km) extension of MS 590 from just west of its original terminus at US 11 to MS 29 southeast of Ellisville. The construction also included a new entrance to Jones County Junior College. The extension was completed in September 2013. Major intersections\nReferences\n   External links",

The orchestra's first artistic leader was the violinist Gunnar Knudsen, from 1938 to 1945. In 1965, the orchestra's name was changed to the Symfoniorkestret i Stavanger, and again in 1982 to its present name. Past artistic leaders of the orchestra have included Susanna Mälkki (2002 2005), and more recently the American conductor Steven Sloane (2007 2013). Christian Vásquez was chief conductor from 2013 to 2019. In addition to its chief conductor, the SSO has appointed conductors with a formal principal responsibility for early music programming, including Frans Brüggen (1990 1997), Philippe Herreweghe, and since 2006, Fabio Biondi.

    "text": "Africando is a musical project formed in 1992 to unite New York based salsa musicians with Senegalese vocalists. Musicians from other African countries were later included under the name Africando All Stars. Salsa has been a hugely popular style in Central and West Africa since the 1940s to 1950s, and the goal of Africando was to merge salsa rhythms from both sides of the Atlantic, mainly based on the African salsa tradition. Africando was initiated by producer Ibrahima Sylla from Côte d'Ivoire and Malian arranger Boncana Maiga of Fania All-Stars. Some of the musicians initially involved were: Ronnie Baro (of Orquesta Broadway), Pape Seck (ex member of Star Band), Nicholas Menheim (associate of Youssou N'Dour), and Medoune Diallo (formerly with Orchestre Baobab). The first two albums were a big success in Africa and in the World Music scene. Singer Pape Seck died in 1995, and was replaced by Gnonnas Pedro from Benin (who died August 2005) and Ronnie Baró of Orquestra Broadway.",

For the album Mandali (2000), well known African musicians, such as Tabu Ley Rochereau, Koffi Olomidé, Salif Keita, Sekouba Bambino, Amadou Balaké and Thione Seck were invited. This new constellation led to the new name Africando All Stars. Whilst in the beginning, the songs were Latin American classics sung in wolof language or a mix of wolof and Spanish, newer songs were African popular music classics, redone with Latin rhythms and instrumentation. With both approaches, Africando has been equally successful. For the album Martina (2003) the group name reverted to the name Africando. The singers on this tribute to mothers, sisters, wives and girlfriends include Ismaël Lô from Senegal, and Nyboma and King Kester Emeneya performing Papa Wemba's song  La Référence .

Early life\nEmmett Leo Kelly was born in Sedan, Kansas, on December 9, 1898. His father, Thomas, was a section foreman for the Missouri Pacific Railroad. While he was still a child, the family moved to Southern Missouri where his father had purchased a farm in Texas County, near the community of Houston, Missouri. In the summer of 1909, he attended both the Mighty Haag and M.L. Clark and Son's circuses. As a youth, he was enrolled by his mother, Mollie, in the Landon School of Cartooning, a correspondence school where he began developing his artistic skill. In 1917, Kelly moved to Kansas City, hoping to get a job as a newspaper cartoonist. It was there that he created a cartoon of a tramp that he originally named  Old Dubey . While in Kansas City, Kelly began working for carnivals and circuses and trained as a trapeze artist. In August 1920, Kelly returned to his adopted hometown of Houston, Missouri where he appeared as a  cartoonist and comedy specialist  at the town's annual  Old Settlers Reunion .",

Although he originally performed as a white-face clown, it was during that tour that he first appeared as a hobo character. After only a few performances as a tramp, Kelly returned to more traditional makeup, but not before a photograph was made of the character which would later be identified as  Weary Willie. The photo appeared in the Howe's Great London Route Book of 1921 above a caption that read:  Emmett Kelly, The Novelty Clown, Cartoonist, Tramp . At the end of the 1921 tour, the Howe's Great London Circus and Van Amburgh's Trained Wild Animal Show was acquired by the American Circus Corporation. In 1922 Kelly was assigned to perform his single trapeze act in the corporation's John Robinson Circus.

Kelly married Eva in Charlottesville, Virginia, on July 21, 1923, and the pair began performing together on the trapeze. The couple returned to the show in 1924, and as the season progressed, Emmett and Eva learned that they were expecting a child. On November 24, the last day of the John Robinson season, Emmett Kelly Jr. was born in Dyersburg, Tennessee. On September 12, 1929, John Ringling purchased the American Circus Corporation. Included in the deal was the John Robinson show, along with the Al G. Barnes, Sparks, Sells-Floto and Hagenbeck-Wallace circuses. As the economy suffered in 1930, disposable income dried up, and for many, circus tickets became a luxury. The John Robinson Circus, the oldest in the United States, was among the first to close, giving its final performance on September 5 at the Nebraska State Fair in Lincoln. Although fewer shows toured in 1931, The Aerial Kellys were among several acts that moved from John Robinson to the Ringling-owned Sells-Floto circus.",

Despite the fact that cowboy movie star Tom Mix was heavily promoted as a feature, Sells-Floto struggled. While the Kellys still considered themselves trapeze performers, Emmett was hired as a white-face clown with the Ringling-owned Hagenbeck-Wallace circus in 1932. A year later, the hobo character that had first been created on a drawing board in Kansas City came to life. Ragged homeless men were commonplace during the Depression, and on April 21, 1933, the tramp clown made his first appearance during a performance at the Chicago Coliseum. In early 1934 a second child, Patrick, was born. At the end of the year, Hagenbeck-Wallace manager Jess Adkins, along with former Sells-Floto manager Zack Terrell, partnered to start their own show, the Cole Bros. and Clyde Beatty Combined Circus. Kelly was among those who made the jump from Hagenbeck-Wallace, although his wife Eva was not given a contract. Shortly after the season started, she asked for a divorce. Kelly later wrote that the sadness he experienced at the time worked its way into the character's persona. In 1937, newspaper writer Hype Igho described the sad clown as  Weary Willie.",

Igho had written about the act by using a term that originated decades earlier as a generic description for a nameless hobo. Kelly later said that Igho encouraged him to use the name and overnight, the character that had once referred to as Old Dubey became Weary Willie. During the winter of 1937 38, Kelly was hired to perform with the Bertram Mills Circus at the Olympia in London. It was at his European debut that he put his own spin on a routine that a veteran clown named Charlie  Shorty  Flem had performed years earlier at Madison Square Garden. The act, which would become Kelly's signature routine, began with him sweeping the ring. A spotlight followed him, and as it danced about, he slapped, swept, and chased the pool of light with his broom. Once he completed the spotlight routine, Willie blew up a balloon until it popped, and then pantomiming his sorrow, he buried the remains in the sawdust.

Despite the star power of Durante and Bolger, Keep Off the Grass did not receive good notices. The only positive review came from the Time critic who wrote:  ...and there's a bum, Emmett Kelly, who would leisurely proceed to eat a ham sandwich out of a paper poke while a bunch of other bums sang a park bench song; then he would lazily brush his teeth with the dry stub of a toothbrush, which provides the one moment of an otherwise uninspired show. Keep off the Grass closed after only 44 performances, and Kelly returned to the nightclub circuit as a cartoonist dressed as a tramp.

After considering both opportunities, Kelly opted to go with Cole Bros., which promised a higher salary. In the five years since Kelly had appeared under canvas in the United States, he honed his craft and matured as a performer to the point that the Cole Bros. publicity department touted him as  the world's funniest clown. The stories that were placed in newspapers in advance of the circus described, and occasionally embellished, details associated with his tour of the United Kingdom. The positive reviews caught the attention of Ringling Bros. and Barnum   Bailey, and in 1942 he joined the circus for the first of fourteen seasons with the show. In 1944, the character that Kelly had created was cast as the star in the featured spectacle. Panto's Paradise was staged as a  dream of a hobo in fairyland.",

Hartford circus fire\nAlthough  Panto's Paradise  was Willie's big number in 1944, his first appearance occurred earlier in the program when the Wallendas were performing on the high wire. During the act, Willie would stand under their rigging, holding a small handkerchief as if to catch them should they fall. The gag had been getting laughs all season, and on July 6, while the circus was in Hartford, Connecticut, there was no reason to believe that anything would be different. As I was putting the finishing touches on my face, I could hear the band playing the waltz music that was my cue to amble into the center ring. At that instant someone ran past the dressing tent yelling  fire. I was trying to run in my big flapping shoes and suddenly realized that I was carrying a bucket of wash water I had grabbed when I left the dressing tent. Kelly said that when he saw the big top burning, he knew that he had to help the panicked crowd exit the tent. It was then that he spotted flames burning near one of the large generator wagons. As he tried to douse the small fire with his bucket of water, he nearly became a casualty himself.",

One of the Caterpillar tractors came rumbling along to get that wagon   to hook on and pull it away from the crowd,  he recalled. It was almost on top of me before I realized what was happening, and as it swung around it did not miss running over me by more than an inch. Kelly's actions that day were immortalized by audience member Ralph Emerson, who took a photograph of Kelly in his full clown make-up and costume, carrying a single bucket of water. The photograph was published in Life on July 17, 1944. The fire and the loss of 168 lives had a profound impact on Kelly. That night, after the victims had been transported to a temporary morgue, he reflected on what had happened. Leaving the showgrounds, I walked past the ruins of the big top and saw some charred shoes and part of a clown doll lying on what had been the hippodrome track. That moment was when the tensions of the past hours broke over me in a wave and I could not keep from crying any longer.",

The fire investigation delayed the show's departure from Hartford for nine days, but on July 15 the trains were headed back to Sarasota, Florida, and within a month, the circus had resumed its tour, playing in stadiums and ballparks. Emmett was among those impressed by the resilience of the big show, telling a reporter  We must entertain. In war time it is more important than ever. It is going to be great in the open air. Return to Hollywood\nIn 1949, after a charity circus performance in Los Angeles, Emmett was approached by an agent representing David O. Selznick. On October 8, while Ringling Bros. and Barnum   Bailey was in Tucson, Arizona, Kelly signed an exclusive one-year contract. At the age of 51, the idea of starting a new career in motion pictures appealed to Kelly, and when the circus closed in Miami, Florida on November 25, he immediately left for California and Hollywood. In the months that followed various ideas were pitched, until finally he was given a script based on a radio mystery series titled The Fat Man. In the film, Kelly would be cast as the villain. Although the idea intrigued him, as he read the script, he became concerned.",

The storyline called for the character to murder three people, then take money that he had stolen from one of the victims and start a circus where he would hide behind his clown makeup. And they wanted Emmett to appear in the film as Willie. The idea of turning his beloved character into a murderer was unacceptable. The producer and director of the film agreed that the killer should not depict the same character that Emmett had spent his career developing. In its review of the film, The New York Times, praised Kelly's acting ability and noted,  As the ex-convict clown, Mr. Kelly herein demonstrates that circus rings need not be his sole field. Following the release of The Fat Man, Kelly's agent reached out to Cecil B. DeMille who was in Sarasota filming early scenes for The Greatest Show on Earth. The circus allowed Emmett to leave the tour for 15 weeks so that he could join James Stewart and Betty Hutton on the Paramount backlot. Unlike his featured role in The Fat Man, Kelly speaks only one word in the DeMille epic. In the middle of the train wreck scene, Hutton told Emmett to get the clowns ready for the parade, and Kelly responded,  Parade? According to Emmett, it took two takes to get it right.",

Willie appeared in several other scenes that were shot on the Hollywood soundstage, including a number with Hutton and Stewart where the three bounced on a trampoline. In the scene Willie unsuccessfully tried to eat a sandwich as Stewart and Hutton sang the song  Be a Jumping Jack. Emmett said that his favorite scene in the film was the segment that showed him playing solitaire on top of a wagon as the circus paraded through the streets of Sarasota. As Willie placed his cards down, his game was interrupted by a sudden gust of wind. Emmett said the effect was accomplished by the blast of an air hose as he played cards against a yellow screen. The special effect was then matched against the parade sequence that had been filmed in February before the season started. Although Kelly accompanied the Hollywood cast to Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia for the scenes filmed there, the only scenes where he appeared under canvas were during a clown walkaround, the Zoppe riding act, and the aerial ballet.

Their courtship coincided with the release of his autobiography, Clown, My Life in Tatters and Smiles, co-authored with Ringling press agent F. Beverly Kelley. The story, published by Prentice-Hall, started appearing in bookstores while the circus was at Madison Square Garden that spring. As part of the promotion, Kelly made numerous appearances at bookstores and on radio, and on March 26, 1954, he was one of the first guests to be interviewed on Edward R. Murrow s new CBS television program Person to Person. One of those who was captivated by Emmett's life story was actor Henry Fonda, who had read the book while he was filming Mister Roberts in the spring of 1954. By that summer, Fonda acquired the film rights and began making plans to produce the story, either as a television program or a full-length motion picture.",

Clown appeared on the CBS television network on March 27, 1955, and was hosted by Ronald Reagan. The program was filmed on a soundstage at Republic Studios and used the equipment of Herbert Weber's Circo Flamante. During the program, Weber performed on the wire along with the DeWayne teeterboard troupe, Hap Hadley's elephant, and Winston's seals. Faye and Rosie Alexander doubled for Emmett and Eva during the flying return sequence. As part of the publicity blitz for Ringling's 1955 New York engagement, Emmett appeared on another CBS program less than a month later.

At the same time Beatty was shooting his picture of Emmett, a separate photographer had been dispatched to Sarasota where a photo of Evi and Stasia was also recorded, capturing both sides of the touching telephone conversation. After 14 years with Ringling Bros. and Barnum   Bailey, 1955 was Emmett's last season with the circus. Although he was already the most recognized clown in America, his family responsibilities, along with myriad new opportunities, were the catalysts that propelled his career to new heights. In the winter of 1956, Kelly was hired to play the role of Willie Voight in an upcoming television program titled The Captain from Kopenick. Under the terms of his 1956 circus contract, Kelly would appear with Ringling only during the indoor dates in New York and at the Boston Garden.

Because the character was so well known, each of the panelists was required to put on a mask before Willie appeared on camera. The interview segment that followed was a classic as Emmett stayed in character throughout, never speaking and responding only with a grunt. After Arlene Francis peppered Willie with questions for five minutes, she correctly identified his occupation as a clown and said, while still blindfolded,  The only clown's name that comes to my mind is Emmett Kelly . The circus was plagued with labor problems in 1956, and prior to its New York premiere, a picket line was set up outside of Madison Square Garden by both the Teamsters and the American Guild of Variety Artists. Many performers loyal to the circus were conflicted because of their membership in AGVA. Kelly, as well as clown Felix Adler and ringmaster Harold Ronk, chose not to cross the picket line, and their contracts were terminated. Within weeks, Weary Willie was appearing in a 45-minute stage show at New York's Roxy Theatre.

After spending five days in January with Cristiani Bros. in Miami, he traveled to both New York and Chicago in February where he made appearances at the big auto shows in those cities. In March, Emmett returned to Palisades Park for the 45-day Beatty-Cole engagement, which again was presented day-and-date against Ringling Bros. and Barnum   Bailey at Madison Square Garden.

    "text": "SM UB-65 was a Type UB III U-boat of the Imperial German Navy during World War I. Ordered on 20 May 1916, the U-boat was built at the Vulkan Werke shipyard in Hamburg, launched on 26 June 1917, and commissioned on 18 August 1917, under the command of Kapitänleutnant Martin Schelle. Service history\nDuring her active career she sailed on six war patrols, sinking six merchant ships and damaging six more. She also sank the British Anchusa-class sloop HMS Arbutus. The U-boat was lost off Padstow, Cornwall on or after 14 July 1918 with the loss of all her 37 crew. Rediscovery\nAn expedition mounted in 2004 as part of the Channel 4 Wreck Detectives underwater archaeological TV series to survey a previously unidentified U-boat wreck that had been located earlier at \n50.611 N 5.005 W    50.611; -5.005, during a routine survey by the Royal Navy, confirmed the identity of the boat as UB-65. Inspection of the wreck by nautical archaeologist Innes McCartney and U-boat historian Dr. Axel Niestlé (through identification of design features such as the type of deck gun, and identification numbers that were stamped on one of her propellers) proved conclusively that the wreck was that of UB-65.",

    "text": "Axel Niestlé (through identification of design features such as the type of deck gun, and identification numbers that were stamped on one of her propellers) proved conclusively that the wreck was that of UB-65. A survey of the wreck showed no obvious indication of weapon attack being the cause of loss (although this could not be ruled out; damage assessment expert David Manley determined that shock damage from a depth charge attack could have caused loss through failure of internal seawater systems and hull penetrations that would not be obvious from an external examination). The aft hatches were open, indicating a possible attempt by at least some of the crew to escape from the vessel. Consideration of the various observations of the wreck, along with historical observations regarding depth control and handling difficulties on diving experienced by other boats of the class, led to a conclusion that she was most likely lost through accidental causes on or after 14 July 1918, the date of the sinking of a Portuguese vessel in the Padstow area. All of her crew of 37 were listed as lost. Having been identified as UB-65 the wreck was given protected place status under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 on 1 November 2006.

According to official German Naval records the boat was presumed lost following a premature explosion of one of her own torpedoes on 10 July 1918, south of the Irish coast. According to United States Navy records it was reported that, whilst returning from patrol and near Fastnet Rock, the U.S. submarine L-2 observed what the captain Paul F. Foster first took to be a buoy on the horizon. Moving closer, Captain Foster found that it was actually a German submarine, only later to be identified as UB-65. It was listing heavily on the water's surface, seemingly disabled. Forster guided his sub around it, hoping to line up a torpedo shot. But before he could do so, the crippled vessel was torn apart by a huge explosion. UB-65 rose up on its bows and sank. There were no survivors and no bodies were ever recovered. The sound of small propellers and an underwater signalling device could be heard for a short while after the explosion. The cause of the explosion was not known.

While UB-65 was being tested for seaworthiness, one of the crew members was swept overboard when he was inspecting the hatches. He was never seen again. During the first test dive of UB-65, a fracture occurred in a ballast tank, causing the submarine to sink to the bottom of the sea. The crew lacked any means of renewing the oxygen in the vessel, but after 12 hours the crew finally managed to raise the submarine to the surface of the ocean. These incidents may have given rise to a belief among the crew that the ship was cursed. As no one wanted to board or be stationed on the ship, it is believed that the German Imperial Navy called a priest on board to exorcise the ship. In his book  Tales of Real Haunting , Tony Allan quotes  According to one source, the American officer thought he saw someone on deck just before UB-65 went down. It was a figure in a German officer's overcoat, standing near the bow with folded arms. If this can be believed, Lieutenant Richter may have put in a final appearance .",

According to researchers George Behe and Michael Goss, the stories about hauntings from UB-65 were invented by the journalist Hector Charles Bywater, who wrote about the subject. They speculated that Bywater was a good story teller who had invented some of his references, such as a post-war pamphlet written by a  Dr. Hecht . Behe and Goss concluded that  Official documents make it extremely difficult to believe that UB-65 was haunted... The responsibility for that rumor-like legend in all its dramatic detail cannot be traced back with any certainty before Hector C. Bywater.

Career\nDíaz attended Roberto Clemente High School in Chicago where he was honored as an Illinois All-State baseball player each of his four years there. As a high schooler, he was invited to dinner by fellow Dominican and star Chicago Cubs outfielder Sammy Sosa. He attended Grayson County College where he was a first-team National Junior College Athletic Association All-American. He was selected by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 37th round of the 2000 Major League Baseball draft and signed as an infielder. Díaz achieved quick success as a minor league hitter, winning the Gulf Coast League batting title in 2001 with a .354 batting average. He managed the same feat the following year hitting .350 in the South Atlantic League. In 2003, he was traded by the Dodgers to the New York Mets for Jeromy Burnitz. Because of his limited fielding skills, the Mets moved Diaz to the outfield in 2004. Díaz made his major league debut with the Mets on September 11, 2004.",

On August 22, 2006, Diaz was designated for assignment by the Mets. On August 30, 2006, Diaz was dealt to the Texas Rangers for Mike Nickeas. After the 2006 season, Diaz headed to the Instructional League to work with hitting coach Brook Jacoby on his swing, then he played in the Dominican Winter League. Diaz competed for a spot on the Rangers 25-man roster, but did not make the cut and started the season with Triple-A Oklahoma.

Later tournaments were organized to offer either  10,000 or  15,000 in prize money and tournaments which offered hospitality to players competing in the main draw to give additional ranking points which are valid under the ATP ranking system, and were organized by a national association or approved by the ITF Men's Circuit Committee. The tournaments were played on a rectangular flat surface, commonly called a tennis court. The dimensions of a tennis court are defined and regulated by the ITF and the court is 23.78 meters (78.0 feet) long, 10.97 meters (36.0 feet) wide. Its width is 8.23 meters (27.0 feet) for singles matches and 10.97 meters (36.0 feet) for doubles matches. Tennis is played on a variety of surfaces and each surface has its own characteristics which affect playing style.

Over its history, the Gmail interface has become integrated with many other products and services from the company, with basic integration as part of Google Account and specific integration points with services such as Google , Google Calendar, Google Drive, Google Hangouts, Google Meet, YouTube, and Google Buzz. It has also been made available as part of Google Workspace (formerly G Suite). The Official Gmail Blog tracks the public history of Gmail from July 2007. Internal development\nGmail was a project started by Google developer Paul Buchheit, who had already explored the idea of web-based email in the 1990s, before the launch of Hotmail, while working on a personal email software project as a college student. Buchheit began his work on Gmail in August 2001. At Google, Buchheit had first worked on Google Groups and when asked  to build some type of email or personalization product , he created the first version of Gmail in one day, reusing the code from Google Groups. The project was known by the code name Caribou, a reference to a Dilbert comic strip about Project Caribou. At the time when Gmail was being developed, existing email services such as Yahoo!",

    "text": "The project was known by the code name Caribou, a reference to a Dilbert comic strip about Project Caribou. At the time when Gmail was being developed, existing email services such as Yahoo! Mail and Hotmail featured extremely slow interfaces that were written in plain HTML, with almost every action by the user requiring the server to reload the entire webpage. Buchheit attempted to work around the limitations of HTML by using the highly interactive JavaScript code, an approach that ultimately came to be called AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML). Buchheit recalls that the high volume of internal email at Google created  a very big need for search . Advanced search capabilities eventually led to considerations for providing a generous amount of storage space, which in turn opened up the possibility of allowing users to keep their emails forever, rather than having to delete them to stay under a storage limit. After considering alternatives such as 100 MB, the company finally settled upon 1 GB of space, compared to the 2 to 4 MB that was the standard at the time. Buchheit had been working on Gmail for about a month when he was joined by another engineer, Sanjeev Singh, with whom he would eventually found the social-networking startup FriendFeed after leaving Google in 2006. Gmail's first product manager, Brian Rakowski, learned about the project on his first day at Google in 2002, fresh out of college.",

In August 2003, another new Google recruit, Kevin Fox was assigned the task of designing Gmail's interface. When the service was finally launched in April 2004, about a dozen people were working on the project. Initially the software was available only internally as an email system for Google employees. According to Google, the software had been used internally for  a number of years  before it was released to the public in 2004. Public release\nFor much of its development, Gmail had been a skunkworks project, kept secret even from most people within Google. It wasn t even guaranteed to launch we said that it has to reach a bar before it s something we want to get out there,  says the Gmail interface designer Kevin Fox. By early 2004, however, almost everybody at Google was using Gmail to access the company's internal email system. Gmail was announced to the public by Google on 1 April 2004, after extensive rumors of its existence during testing. Owing to the April Fool's Day release, the company's press release aroused skepticism in the technology world, especially since Google had been known for making April Fool's jokes, such as PigeonRank.",

However, they explained that their real joke had been a press release saying that they would take offshoring to the extreme by putting employees in a  Google Copernicus Center  on the Moon. Jonathan Rosenberg, Google's vice-president of products, was quoted by BBC News as saying,  We are very serious about Gmail. Even when the service was announced to the public, Google did not have the required infrastructure in place to provide millions of users a reliable service with a gigabyte of space apiece. Gmail ran on three hundred old Pentium III computers nobody else at Google wanted. This was sufficient for the limited beta rollout the company planned, which involved inviting about 1,000 opinion leaders and then allowing them to invite their friends and family members to become beta testers, with trials beginning on 21 March 2004. Extended beta phase\nOnce it became clear that Gmail was real, and not an April Fools' joke, invitations became highly desired. Although the limited rollout was born of necessity, it created an aura of exclusivity which contributed to its publicity windfall. Everyone wanted it even more.",

It was hailed as one of the best marketing decisions in tech history, but it was a little bit unintentional  says Georges Harik, who was responsible for most of Google's new products at the time. Active users from the Blogger community were offered the chance to participate in the beta-testing on 20 April and later, Gmail members occasionally received  invitations  which they could send to anyone. One round of invitations was sent out on 1 May and another three invitations were given to all active members on 1 June. When Gmail increased the supply of invitations, the nascent buying and selling market for Gmail invitations collapsed. During the early months of the initial beta phase, Gmail's well-publicized feature set and the exclusive nature of the accounts caused the aftermarket price of Gmail invitations to skyrocket. According to PC World magazine, Gmail invitations were selling on eBay for as much as US 150, with some accounts being sold for several thousand dollars. After a new round of invitations in early June, the price for invitations fell to between US 2  5. Websites such as Gmail Swap emerged to allow philanthropic Gmail users to donate invitations to people who wanted them. On 28 June 2004, Google amended its policy to forbid the selling of registered accounts.",

This was posted with detailed information to popular technology site Slashdot at 9:23 a.m. PST on 12 January 2005. On 13 January 2005, developers at Gmail announced that they had fixed the problem and that the security flaw had been patched.

On 1 April 2005, exactly one year after the initial release, Gmail increased the mailbox size to 2 GB, advertising it as  2 GB plus  and introduced some other new features, including formatted editing which gave users the option of sending messages in HTML or plain text.

On 1 July 2011, Pope Benedict XVI appointed him a chaplain of His Holiness with the title monsignor. In April 2014 Pope Francis appointed him as his second personal secretary. He continues to work for the Secretariat of State as well. His appointment was interpreted as gesture of support for Eastern Catholic churches and dialog with the Arab and Muslim world. By the time he took on this position, he was already living in the same residence as Pope Francis, the Domus Sanctae Marthae. In rare public remarks for a papal secretary, he praised the development of dialog with Islam, saying that the meeting of Pope Francis and Ahmad al-Tayyib in Cairo in 2017  gave proof that we can talk, we can talk, we can also love each other people of different religions. Before there was no dialogue, and therefore there was distance, there was also a bit of hostility towards one another. Now there is deep friendship. After the same two leaders issued their Document on Human Fraternity in February 2019, Lahzi Gaid was named in September as one of the first members of a committee to promote its principles. He was also named a member of its executive board. References",

History and architecture\nThe Episcopal Diocese of Maryland established the parish in 1811 and it first held services in Old Paint Branch Chapel in Calverton, Maryland near the border between Prince George's County, Maryland and Montgomery County, Maryland. Between 1825 and 1847, the congregation worshiped in Vansville, Maryland, also in Prince George's County. The wooden structures used by the congregation in the 19th century were destroyed by fire, storm, tornado and lightning. Two other historic once rural parishes have similar names. One, Zion Episcopal Church, was established in Urbana in Frederick County, Maryland in 1802 and burned down in 1961, although the ruins and cemetery remain as a historic site and the church is expected to be rebuilt. Another, known as St. Mark's Paint Branch Chapel, was built in 1774 in what became Silver Spring in Montgomery County, Maryland, rebuilt in 1835 and ultimately removed in 1877 and replaced by a modern structure circa 1980.

William Pinkney, then the rector of St. Matthew's Parish in Hyattsville since 1836, spoke during the 1857 consecration and took care of parishioners during their first year at this location. During the American Civil War, Union artillery forces occupied the strategic site on a hill overlooking historic Route 1. However, it was destroyed by fire in 1868 and rebuilt in wood, only to be again destroyed by a severe storm in 1874. The current brick building with a steep pitched roof, round-arched stained glass windows and bell tower was erected in 1877 at the urging of its former rector, and on April 22, 1878 was consecrated by Rt.

    "text": "The Department of Railways was a subdepartment of the Victorian Government's Board of Land and Works that was the first government operator on the Victorian railway system. History\nActs establishing the Board of Land and Works were passed by the Parliament of Victoria in 1857, and received royal assent that November. Among other things, they authorised the Board to begin the construction of major railways   to Geelong and to the Murray River via Sandhurst (later named Bendigo)   and to oversee the construction and operating activities of the remaining private railway companies. The Board formed a Department of Railways to carry out its functional responsibilities, of which Joseph Wood was appointed the first secretary. Its creation was resisted by some parliamentarians, who felt that the department represented unnecessary expenditure on the part of the Board. Richard Nash was appointed department secretary in November 1860. By 1870, the department was responsible for the railway lines to Echuca, Williamstown, Ballarat and Geelong, and had begun construction on several others. It had 77 locomotives, 143 passenger carriages and over 1,000 goods wagons in operation. In around April 1871, a combined Department of Railways and Roads was created which assumed all the functions of the Department of Railways.

Ecology\nOver most of its range, the North African fire salamander is ovoviviparous with eight to 50 eggs per batch, females retaining the eggs internally until they hatch, with the young being nurtured from the egg yolks. However, in the Tingitana region, the young seem to obtain their nourishment, at least in part from the female, in the form of secreted fluids and are considered viviparous. This results in fifteen or so larvae which are deposited in streams or pools. Status\nAlthough locally common in places, the North African fire salamander is rare in others and has a fragmented distribution range. The main threat it faces is the destruction of its forest habitat. Other threats include the channelling of the forest streams for irrigation, overgrazing by livestock, and collection of the salamanders for the pet trade. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being  vulnerable .

    "text": "Sociological modeling of emergence\nCommunity Builders has pioneered research in a sociological modeling of emergence and has observed the effects of self-organization on groups of marginalized persons. A 2005, the Community Builders' research initiative entitled  A Sociological Modeling of Emergence  performed a longitudinal survey of 140 persons at risk to homelessness in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside. The study established a Gold Standard of best practices for privately owned rooming houses and found that tenants experienced a 40-60  reduction in addiction and mental illness rates following a six-month stay in rooming houses which utilized best practices. Another research paper entitled  Emergent models of wellness: a case study of management practices in single occupant hotels of Vancouver CA  (Alexiuk, M.D., Wiebe, G.K. And Pizzi, N.J.) was submitted to the Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering, 2005. Alexiuk, Wiebe and Pizzi utilized results of the aforementioned longitudinal study and argued that  The theory of emergence has become a useful framework for exploring salient features of dynamical systems. This framework provides insight into hitherto intractable problems in sociology and economics. One such problem is the definition of a mathematical model of homelessness that enables policy evaluation with respect to the holistic wellness of the impacted individuals. Swarm simulations provide numerical and visual results to the researcher allowing both quantitative and intuitive hypothesis testing.",

The event was run as a bumps race and was the 128th set of races in the series of Lent Bumps which have been held annually in late February or early March since 1887. In this edition of the Lents, the women's divisions raced before the equivalent men's divisions, and the numbers of men's and women's boats competing were equal. The races were the first set of Bumps to be held following the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced the cancellation of the Lents in 2021 and the Mays in 2020 and 2021. They were also the first in which Lucy Cavendish fielded a men's boat after the college became co-educational in October 2021. Head of the River crews\nLady Margaret rowed over on all four days to retain the men's headship they won in 2020.

Written and directed by Sam Catlin, it aired on AMC in the United States and Canada on September 1, 2013. Plot\nWalter White cautiously examines his house in search of Jesse Pinkman, who broke in and doused it in gasoline. Jesse is absent, but Walt finds white powder in Saul Goodman's crashed car, suspecting that Jesse is high on meth. After a cleaning crew cannot fully remove the gasoline scent, Walt douses his clothing and the seats of his car with it, concocting a fabrication about a pump malfunction at the gas station. Skyler and Walter White Jr. are doubtful for different reasons. Walter Jr thinks he fainted again due to the cancer, whereas Skyler thinks something more sinister. The family moves into a hotel until the carpet and flooring can be replaced. Walt secretly meets with Saul and Patrick Kuby in the hotel's parking lot, asking for an update on Jesse's whereabouts. Saul hints at the possibility of killing Jesse, but Walt rejects the idea. Back in their hotel room, Skyler confronts Walt over his lies, having just seen him with Saul. Walt confesses that Jesse is upset and tried to burn down their house, but he is not concerned since Jesse decided against it.",

Walt confesses that Jesse is upset and tried to burn down their house, but he is not concerned since Jesse decided against it. A shocked Skyler presses Walt to kill Jesse, who she views as a threat to their safety. A flashback reveals Hank Schrader trailed Jesse to Walt's residence after Jesse assaulted Saul, talking Jesse out of torching the house. Hank convinces Jesse to work together to bring Walt down, leaving moments before Walt arrived. Marie talks to her therapist about her issues with Walt but will not disclose the full extent of his criminality. Hank keeps Jesse at their house because he believes Jesse is more protected there; Marie agrees once Hank tells her that Jesse's involvement is bad for Walt. Hank and Steve Gomez tape Jesse as he recounts his history with Walt. Since there is no physical evidence, and Walt has left the meth business, Hank needs something incriminating enough to take to the authorities. Walt leaves a voicemail for Jesse, asking to meet in a plaza to reconcile over Brock Cantillo's poisoning. Hank coerces the reluctant Jesse to comply and retrieve appropriate evidence against Walt, despite Jesse's fear for his own safety. Hank reassures Jesse by recounting Walt's previous attempts to protect him at his own expense and states that since the meeting is in a public place, he will be safe.",

However, privately with Gomez, Hank is indifferent to Jesse risking his death; if Jesse is killed on camera, it can still be used as evidence. Wired for sound, Jesse goes to meet with Walt but backs down after mistaking a nearby pedestrian for a hitman. Angered, Jesse goes to a pay phone to call Walt and threatens him, telling him that he will  get him where he really lives. Hank berates Jesse for blowing the plan, but Jesse calmly informs him that he has a better strategy in mind. Meanwhile, Walt calls Todd, requesting another hit from his uncle, Jack.

More than This  was the group's last top-10 UK hit, peaking at No. 6 on the UK Singles Chart, and also charted in the United States, reaching No. 58 on the Billboard Rock Top Tracks chart. More than This  has become one of Roxy Music's most popular tracks. American alternative rock band 10,000 Maniacs released a cover version in 1997 that peaked at No. 25, and British singer Emmie released a cover that reached No. 5 in the UK in January 1999. The cover of the single's release is the painting Veronica Veronese, by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, which was completed in 1872 with Alexa Wilding as the model. In Pop Culture\nThe Song was prominently used in 2003 romantic comedy Lost in Translation. Composition\nThe song was written by lead vocalist Bryan Ferry, who has stated in interviews that he began writing the songs for Avalon while on the western coast of Ireland, which he believes contributed to the dark melancholy of the album. More than This  is somewhat unusual for a pop song in that Ferry's lead vocals end 1 minute and 45 seconds before the song does, leaving the remainder as a synthesizer-driven instrumental outro.",

Personal\nSieders was born in Blacktown, New South Wales on 19 January 1982. In 1997, he was involved in a car accident on his way to soccer when the car he was travelling lost control on black ice and crashed into a pole. The driver of the car was killed. CareFlight responded to the accident and Sieders believes that they saved his life. He spent 88 days in intensive care, underwent 30 operations over 51 weeks in hospital. He was initially told he would never walk again. A second car accident in December 2011 resulted in him being back in a wheelchair and limited walking through the use of crutches . He took up paracanoe after the accident to improve his fitness and reduce weight gain. He said  It was developing into a serious problem so I looked around for something to do. It had to be a low-impact sport because of my injured hip. I'm a water-lover, so kayaking was the way to go .

Grzymała was born in Dunajowce (now Dunaivtsi, Ukraine). He began attending military school in 1807, and took part in the Battle of Borodino (1812), for which he received the medal Virtuti Militari.

Origins of the name\nIt is generally believed that the Orlyonok's name was taken from the title of a popular Young Pioneer song with the same name about a 16-year-old Red Army soldier about to be executed by enemies during the Russian Civil War. A statue named  Orlyonok  stands in the center of the camp, being part of the Memorial Plaza. It is similar to another statue with the same name in the city of Chelyabinsk. History\nThe Orlyonok Young Pioneer camp was established on July 12, 1960 by the decision of the Council of Ministers of the Russian SFSR (March 27, 1959). Similar to Artek, Orlyonok was intended for Russian children who were notable for excellent study, prize winners at various Student Olympiads, contests, or sports competitions, decorated or notable members of Komsomol or Young Pioneer organization activists. In 1962 Orlyonok welcomed 50 representatives of the then-experimental Communard Movement, including kids from the famous Leningrad Frunze Community organization (now dismissed) led by Igor Ivanov. During this time, Orlyonok acquired some of its laws and traditions and adopted what has become known as the creative team effort methodology.",

After the successful experience of the previous year, in 1963 Orlyonok hosted the first all-USSR gathering of young communards. In the beginning, the 1960 Orlyonok camp hosted 520 children, and by 1973 the annual attendance increased to nearly 17,000. By then Orlyonok had grown to an area of 3 square kilometers, with 60 buildings, including the dormitories, the  Young Pioneer Palace  (with a winter swimming pool filled with sea water, and a cinema), secondary school, medical building, Museum of Aircraft and Cosmonautics, astronomical observatory, sports stadium, playgrounds and a winter sports hall. There were more than 200 hobby groups of 50 different kinds, mostly in polytechnics, sports, and aesthetics. Orlyonok had its own passenger ship, 45 yachts, and many motor boats and rowboats. In the early 1990s, when the Young Pioneer organization of the Soviet Union was dismantled, the camp attendance in Orlyonok was greatly decreased; however, attendance has increased since 2000, as the camp was nostalgically associated with the Young Pioneer camps of the past.",

In 2011 Orlyonok hosted a delegation from UNESCO reviewing Orlyonok admission to the UNESCO Associated Schools Project Network. In 2012 Orlyonok was admitted to the UNESCO ASPNet. On February 5, 2014, Orlyonok hosted the final part of the 2014 Winter Olympics torch relay.

In April 2025, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) warned that Russia, then undertaking an invasion of Ukraine, planned to intensify during the summer of that year the deportation of Ukrainian children to its occupied and own territory, including to Orlyonok and also Artek.

Orlyonok culture\nOrlyonok has its own history and traditions, one of the most important among them   respect for people, their work, their personality, and experience ... This requires future  Eaglets  to have a certain culture of communication and interaction with peers and adults. Furthermore, almost everything is planned and done by the kids themselves, as part of joint activities performed together with teachers and peers. For example, self-help is the rule of the day: from simple things like making one's bed in the morning and self-care, to collectively serving a rotating duty around the camp and in the dining rooms.

Eaglet Circle\nThe Eaglet Circle is the smallest stable self-governing, self-regulating unit, usually under 35 kids, unlike Boy Scouts, of both genders, directed by two or more Eaglet Circle Leaders. Initially members of the Eaglet Circle are called  Eaglet Candidates , and the actual  Eaglet  title has to be earned by successfully completing tasks assigned, while displaying a positive attitude. The processes of officially establishing the Eaglet Circle and assigning individual Eaglet titles happens during the second and third weeks of camp. The Eaglet Circle, while supervised and directed by one or more Eaglet Circle Leaders, is also governed by the Eaglet Circle Captain (elected permanently for the duration of the camp) and the Eaglet Circle Captain of the Day (elected daily during the evening meeting).",

Throughout the day, there could be multiple smaller units formed, Task Committees. The smallest Task Committee may be 3 4 kids that will work on assignments. For example, an entire Eaglet Circle may have to come up with a stage performance, and to make the task easier, will break into smaller Task Committees addressing various parts: stage setup, choreography, music, script, troop, etc. etc. Once work commences, results are reported at the Eaglet Circle meeting. Eaglet Circles obey five Eaglet Circle laws and follow about a dozen traditions. Each Eaglet Circle is also supposed to have some kind of signature, distinguishing it from other circles, and this is where creativity and improvisation plays an important part; simply copying what others have done before is viewed as below the Eaglet Circle's self-respect. The Eaglet Circle's signature could be a song, a T-shirt, a name, a talisman or a mascot, or the combination of all of these, but altogether it should have some form of meaning for the particular Eaglet Circle that it represents.",

Do something good all the time, plant trees or flowers, clean up what you can and help others, even when not asked to. There is no Earth B if we trash this Earth A.

    "text": "Offside is one of the laws in association football, codified in Law 11 of the Laws of the Game. The law states that a player is in an offside position if any of their body parts, except the hands and arms, are in the opponents' half of the pitch and closer to the opponents' goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent (the last opponent is usually, but not necessarily, the goalkeeper). Being in an offside position is not an offence in itself, but a player so positioned when the ball is played by a teammate can be judged guilty of an offside offence if they receive the ball or will otherwise become  involved in active play , will  interfere with an opponent , or will  gain an advantage  by being in that position. Offside is often considered one of the most difficult-to-understand aspects of the sport. Significance\nOffside is judged at the moment the ball is last touched by the most recent teammate to touch the ball. Being in an offside position is not an offence in itself. A player who was in an offside position at the moment the ball was last touched or played by a teammate must then become involved in active play, in the opinion of the referee, in order for an offence to occur. When the offside offence occurs, the referee stops play, and awards an indirect free kick to the defending team from the place where the offending player became involved in active play.",

The offside offence is neither a foul nor misconduct as it does not belong to Law 12. Like fouls, however, any play (such as the scoring of a goal) that occurs after an offence has taken place, but before the referee is able to stop the play, is nullified. The only time an offence related to offside is cautionable is if a defender deliberately leaves the field in order to deceive their opponents regarding a player's offside position, or if a forward, having left the field, returns and gains an advantage. In neither of these cases is the player penalised for being offside; instead they are cautioned for acts of unsporting behaviour. An attacker who is able to receive the ball behind the opposition defenders is often in a good position to score. The offside rule limits attackers' ability to do this, requiring that they be onside when the ball is played forward. Though restricted, well-timed passes and fast running allow an attacker to move into such a situation after the ball is kicked forward without committing the offence. Officiating decisions regarding offside, which can often be a matter of only centimetres or inches, can be critical in games, as they may determine whether a promising attack can continue, or even if a goal is allowed to stand.",

One of the main duties of the assistant referees is to assist the referee in adjudicating offside their position on the sidelines giving a more useful view sideways across the pitch. Assistant referees communicate that an offside offence has occurred by raising a signal flag. However, as with all officiating decisions in the game, adjudicating offside is ultimately up to the referee, who can overrule the advice of their assistants if they see fit. Application\nThe application of the offside rule may be considered in three steps: offside position, offside offence, and offside sanction. Offside position\nA player is in an  offside position  if they are in the opposing team's half of the field and also  nearer to the opponents' goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent.

It is also not an offence if the ball was last deliberately played by an opponent (except for a deliberate save). In this context, according to the IFAB,  A 'save' is when a player stops, or attempts to stop, a ball which is going into or very close to the goal with any part of the body except the hands arms (unless the goalkeeper within the penalty area). An offside offence may occur if a player receives the ball directly from either a direct free kick, indirect free kick or dropped-ball. Since offside is judged at the time the ball is touched or played by a teammate, not when the player receives the ball, it is possible for a player to receive the ball significantly past the second-to-last opponent, or even the last opponent, without committing an offence, since an onside player is free to run to any position after the ball is played. A player who was offside when their teammate played the ball (and therefore liable for an offside offence should they interfere with play) but becomes onside when the ball is played by another player then ceases to be liable for an offside offence. That is, the determination of offside is reset each time the ball is played by a different onside player. Determining whether a player is  involved in active play  can be complex.",

In an effort to avoid such criticisms, which were based on the fact that phrases such as  interfering with play ,  interfering with an opponent , and  gaining an advantage  were not clearly defined, FIFA issued new guidelines for interpreting the offside law in 2003; and these were incorporated into Law 11 in July 2005. The new wording sought to define the three cases more precisely, but a number of football associations and confederations continued to request more information about what movements a player in an offside position could make without interfering with an opponent. In response to these requests, IFAB circular 3 was issued in 2015 to provide additional guidance on the criteria for interfering with an opponent. This additional guidance is now included in the main body of the law, and forms the last three conditions under the heading  Interfering with an opponent  as shown above.

Officiating\nIn enforcing this rule, the referee depends greatly on an assistant referee, who generally keeps in line with the second-to-last opponent, the ball, or the halfway line, whichever is closer to the goal line of their relevant end. An assistant referee signals for an offside offence by first raising their flag to a vertical position and then, if the referee stops play, by partly lowering their flag to an angle that signifies the location of the offence:\nFlag pointed at a 45-degree angle downwards: offence has occurred in the third of the pitch nearest to the assistant referee;\nFlag parallel to the ground: offence has occurred in the middle third of the pitch;\nFlag pointed at a 45-degree angle upwards: offence has occurred in the third of the pitch furthest from the assistant referee. The assistant referees' task with regard to offside can be difficult, as they need to keep up with attacks and counter-attacks, consider which players are in an offside position when the ball is played, and then determine whether and when the offside-positioned players become involved in active play.",

The difficulty of offside officiating is often underestimated by spectators. Trying to judge if a player is level with an opponent at the moment the ball is kicked is not easy: if an attacker and a defender are running in opposite directions, they can be two metres (6') apart in less than a second. Some researchers believe that offside officiating errors are  optically inevitable . It has been argued that human beings and technological media are incapable of accurately detecting an offside position quickly enough to make a timely decision. Sometimes it simply is not possible to keep all the relevant players in the visual field at once. There have been some proposals for automated enforcement of the offside rule. VAR and semi-automation\nIn matches using Video Assistant Referees (VAR) assistant referees who decide on offsides are required to avoid raising the flag for an offside decision until the play proceeds to a natural conclusion, unless the offside is obvious. This allows a team who might have been called for an offside offence to instead continue and any subsequent goal to be checked by VAR.

SAOT produces 3D virtual replays of the situation which are displayed on stadium screens and broadcasts.

Curry and Dunning suggest that offside play was considered  highly ungentlemanly  at some schools; this attitude may have been reflected in the use of terminology such as  sneaking  at Eton and  loiter ing   at Cambridge. In general, offside rules intend to prevent players from  goal-hanging  staying near the opponent's goal and waiting for the ball to be passed to them directly.

Such a player was prevented from kicking the ball, touching the ball down, or interfering with an opponent. Many other school and university laws from this period were similar to Rugby School's in that they were  strict  i.e. any player ahead of the ball was in an off-side position. (This is similar to the current offside law in rugby, under which any player between the ball and the opponent's goal who takes part in play, is liable to be penalised.)

Thring expressed his views through correspondence in the sporting newspapers such as The Field, and through the publication in 1862 of The Simplest Game, a proposed set of laws of football.

A number of representatives who supported rugby-style football did not attend this additional meeting, resulting in hacking and carrying being banned. Although the offside law was not itself a significant issue in the dispute between the pro- and anti-hacking clubs, it was completely rewritten.

Charles Alcock, writing in 1890, suggested that it was made in order to induce two public schools, Westminster and Charterhouse, to join the association. Those two schools did indeed become members of the FA after the next annual FA meeting (February 1867), in response to a letter-writing campaign by newly installed FA secretary Robert Graham. Early proposals for change (1867 1874)\nOver the next seven years, there were several attempts to change the three-player rule, but none was successful:\nIn 1867, Barnes FC proposed that the offside rule should be removed altogether, arguing that  a player did not stop to count whether there were three of his opponents between him and their own goal . It was also proposed that the FA should revert to its original  strict  offside rule. This change was introduced in 1868 (Branham College), 1871 ( The Oxford Association ) and 1872 (Notts County). There were attempts to introduce the one-player rule of the Sheffield Football Association in 1867 (Sheffield FC), 1872 (Sheffield Football Association), 1873 (Nottingham Forest), and 1874 (Sheffield Association).",

Offside was the subject of the biggest dispute between the Sheffield Football Association (which produced its own  Sheffield Rules ) and the Football Association. However, the two codes were eventually unified without any change in this area; the Sheffield Clubs accepted the FA's three-player offside rule in 1877, after the FA compromised by allowing the throw-in to be taken in any direction. Offside in own half (1907)\nThe original laws allowed players to be in an offside position even when in their own half. This happened rarely, but was possible when one team pressed high up the field, for example in a Sunderland v Wolverhampton Wanderers match in December 1901. When an attacking team adopted the so-called  one back  game, in which only the goalkeeper and one outfield player remained in defensive positions, it was even possible for players to be caught offside in their own penalty area. In May 1905, Clyde FC suggested that players should not be offside in their own half, but this suggestion was rejected by the Scottish Football Association. It was objected that the change would lead to  forwards hanging about close to the half-way line, as opportunists .",

After the Scotland v England international of April 1906 ended with the Scottish wingers being repeatedly caught offside by England's use of a  one back  game, Clyde again proposed the same rule-change to the Scottish FA meeting: this time it was accepted. The Scottish proposal gained support in England. At the 1906 meeting of the International Football Association Board, the Scottish FA announced that it would introduce the proposed change at the next annual meeting, in 1907. In March 1907, the council of the  English  Football Association approved this change, and it was passed by IFAB in June 1907. Two-player rule (1925)\nThe Scottish FA urged the change from a three-player to a two-player offside rule as early as 1893. Such a change was first proposed at a meeting of IFAB in 1894, where it was rejected. It was proposed again by the SFA in 1902, upon the urging of Celtic FC, and again rejected. A further proposal from the SFA also failed in 1913, after the Football Association objected. The SFA advanced the same proposal in 1914, when it was again rejected after opposition from both the Football Association and the Football Association of Wales.

In 1924, the Scottish proposal was once again opposed by the English FA, and defeated; it was, however, indicated that a version of the proposal would be adopted the next year. On 30 March 1925, the FA arranged a trial match at Highbury where two proposed changes to the offside rules were tested. During the first half, a player could not be offside unless within forty yards of the opponents' goal-line. In the second half, the two-player rule was used. The two-player proposal was considered by the FA at its annual meeting on 8 June. Proponents cited the new rule's potential to reduce stoppages, avoid refereeing errors, and improve the spectacle, while opponents complained that it would give  undue advantage to attackers ; referees were overwhelmingly opposed to the change.

It led to an immediate change in the style of play, with the game becoming more stretched,  short passing giv ing  way to longer balls , and the development of the W-M formation.

    "text": "Unadopted experiments\nDuring the 1973 74 and 1974 75 seasons, an experimental version of the offside rule was operated in the Scottish League Cup and Drybrough Cup competitions. The concept was that offside should only apply in the last 18 yards (16 m) of play (inside or beside the penalty area). To signify this, the horizontal line of the penalty area was extended to the touchlines. FIFA President Sir Stanley Rous attended the 1973 Scottish League Cup Final, which was played using these rules. The manager of one of the teams involved, Celtic manager Jock Stein, complained that it was unfair to expect teams to play under one set of rules in one game and then a different set a few days before or later. The experiment was quietly dropped after the 1974 75 season, as no proposal for a\nfurther experiment or rule change was submitted for the Scottish Football Association board to consider. It was briefly experimented again in the 1991 FIFA U-17 World Championship, in Italy. In 1972, the North American Soccer League adopted a variation of the offside rule in which it added a line on the field 35 yards from each goal line; a player could only be offside within that area of the opponent's half. The rule was dropped in 1982 at the insistence of FIFA which threatened to withdraw recognition of the league if it did not apply all of the official rules of football.",

Subsequent developments: exceptions at the restart of play\nGoal kick\nSince the first FA laws of 1863, a player has not been penalised for being in an offside position at the moment a teammate takes a goal kick. (According to the  strict  offside law used in 1863, every player on the attacking side would automatically have been in an offside position from such a goalkick, since it had to be taken from the goal line and a player could be in an offside position even when in their own half.)\nThrow-in\nUnder the original laws of 1863, it was not possible to be offside from a throw-in; however, since the ball was required to be thrown in at right-angles to the touch-line, it would have been unusual for a player to gain significant advantage from being ahead of the ball. In 1877, the throw-in law was changed to allow the ball to be thrown in any direction. The next year (1878) a new law was introduced to allow a player to be offside from a throw-in. This situation lasted until 1920, when the law was altered to prevent a player being offside from a throw-in.",

This rule-change was praised on the grounds that it would deter teams from  seeking safety or wasting time by sending  the ball  into touch , and thus reduce stoppages. Corner kick\nWhen first introduced in 1872, the corner kick was required to be taken from the corner-flag itself, which made it impossible for an attacking player to be in an offside position relative to the ball. In 1874, the corner-kick was allowed to be taken up to one yard from the corner-flag, thus opening up the possibility of a player being in an offside position. At the International Football Conference of December 1882, it was agreed that a player should not be offside from a corner-kick; this change was incorporated into the Laws of the Game in 1883. Free kick\nThe laws of football have always permitted an offside offence to be committed from a free kick. The free kick contrasts, in this respect, with other restarts of play such as the goal kick, corner kick, and throw-in. A 1920 proposal by the FA to exempt the free-kick from the offside rule was unexpectedly rejected by IFAB.",

A further unsuccessful proposal to remove the possibility of being offside from a direct free-kick was rejected in 1929. Similar proposals to prevent offside offences from any free-kick were advanced in 1974 and 1986, each time without success. In 1987, the Football Association (FA) obtained the permission of IFAB to test such a rule in the 1987 88 GM Vauxhall Conference. At the next annual meeting, the FA reported to IFAB that the experiment had, as predicted,  assisted further the non-offending team and also generated more action near goal, resulting in greater excitement for players and spectators ; it nevertheless withdrew the proposal. Offside trap\nPioneered in the early 20th century by Notts County and later adopted by influential Argentine coach Osvaldo Zubeldía, the offside trap is a defensive tactic designed to force the attacking team into an offside position. Just before an attacking player is played a through ball, the last defender or defenders move upfield, isolating the attacker into an offside position. The execution requires careful timing by the defence and is considered a risk, since running upfield against the direction of attack may leave the goal exposed.",

Now that changes to the interpretations of  interfering with play, interfering with an opponent and gaining an advantage  mean a player is not guilty of an offside offence unless they become directly and clearly involved in active play, players not involved in active play cannot be  caught offside , making the tactic riskier. An attacker, upon realising they are in an offside position, may simply choose to avoid interfering with play until the ball is played by someone else. Manager Arrigo Sacchi was also known for using a high defensive line, with distance between the defence and midfield lines never greater than 25 to 30 metres (yards), and the offside trap with his teams. He introduced a more attacking minded tactical philosophy with A.C. Milan, which was highly successful, namely an aggressive high-pressing system, which used a 4 4 2 formation, an attractive, fast, attacking, and possession-based playing style, and which also used innovative elements such as zonal marking and a high back line line playing the offside trap, which largely deviated from previous systems in Italian football, despite still maintaining defensive solidity. Liverpool F.C. under Jürgen Klopp, a noted follower of Sacchi, were known for their highly effective offside trap.",

It involved playing a high defensive line with quick centre-backs like Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konaté who could move forward quickly to catch opponents offside. In the 2021 22 Premier League season, they caught 53  more the amount of opponents offside than the next best team (144 times compared to Manchester City's 94). Not all offside traps need to have a high line, the offside trap can be executed from everywhere on the pitch. Manuel Pellegrini often used the offside trap with the defenders sitting at the edge of their own box. The positioning of the defensive line dictates the available space that the opponents can run into. By adopting a high line, the opposition sometimes may be crammed into their own half, while a lower defensive line gives less space to run in behind.

    "text": "Soon after the ministries were merged into the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy, the respective departments were likewise merged into the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy. During his State of the Nation Address on 9 February 2023, Ramaphosa announced his intention to appoint a minister of electricity, based in the presidency, to oversee all aspects of the country's response to the ongoing electricity crisis, including leading the National Energy Crisis Committee. The first minister in the presidency for electricity, Kgosientso Ramokgopa, was appointed in a cabinet reshuffle on 6 March 2023. Among other things, the minister of electricity had responsibility for procurement of new electricity generation capacity. However, he served alongside the incumbent mineral resources and energy minister, Gwede Mantashe, and there was uncertainty about the delineation of functions between them   especially given that a third minister, the minister of public enterprises, oversaw Eskom. On 30 June 2024, appointing his third cabinet, Ramaphosa announced that the relevant ministries would be reconfigured: energy would be detached from the mineral resources portfolio and become the sole prerogative of a new minister of electricity and energy.
